while i fly entirely caldari myself i have to disagree with this on the grounds it would make missiles to powerful overall i do not disagree that its kind of a screw up for bonuses thoumaybe instead of the 5 make it 3 bonus to damage overallor a 5 reduction in explosion radius thou there is a skill that already does thismy two cents
i cross trained caldari to fly drake in stead of hurricane cuz its just better that said i do not support this some caldari missile boats need help not all this blanket approach will make certain ships cough drake cough ludicrously op sort rockets out adjust individual ship bonuses that need itthis blanket rainbow bonuses begging session is either utterly blinkered ignorance or a desperate attempt at make my drake lolwtfpwnsaucefotm pleeeeaze
phoon  5 x t2 800mm with fusion  289 dps at bs level vphoon  5 x t2 siege mjolnir  328 at bs level i edit 312 level 0 is more correct and still moar than acsany more questions 
to guy with phoonppl were talking about caldari boats matar discution is that way ps phoon bonuses 5 bonus to siege and cruise missile launcher rate of fire per leveltoo all damage types  i want that too you know  d
you would have to tweak missile damage especially heavieshams so you dont end up with too much of a good thing provided if that is done i see no reason to hold on to that outdated bonusthen again kinetic may lose some hitting shields but gain a lot hitting armour  you conveniently neglected to mention that t1 armour tankers generally have low explosive and kinetic resists 525 difference depending on race gallente having highest base kinwith t1 armour making up a vast majority of ships flown in pvp a kinetic bonus is actually a pretty damn good thingthe ability to choose damage type is no longer a missile boon since projectiles have pretty much the same now so missiles biggest advantage is range and invulnerability to the infernal tdsall in all no
supportedi read as far as post 116 then had to skip to the end too much to read while i agree that the ship bonuses should apply to all ammo types fired the caldari should still be encouraged to primarily use kinetic damagethis could either be by  a giving all missile ammo a kinetic component to its damage maybe 25 as suggested earlierorb the drone bonus method give each missile ammo type its own varied characteristics kinetic missiles would do the most raw damage but another would have better explosion velocity and another have better flight time etct
i could almost support this on one condition by this is mean the op not that  it does not apply to drake or cerb as they just dont need it but since i suspect that this proposal or at least some of the agreement with it is more about making those 2 ships lol op and not about helping the other cmbs i dont expect anyone to agree to this very reasonable condition
not signedmissiles users are able to choose their damage types while all other weapon system users must deal with impure damage types projectiles are the closest to missiles in being able to choose damage types but have to deal with several other problems clip size ammo size poor dps

look it he other way  an account totally dedicated to gathering datacores 6 of the best agents for each character will generate a little more than 1000 datacoresmonth without running missions creating the account will require several months as you need the skills at 5 including 2 millions sp for research project management at 5 and standing with 2 corporation at least  average 30 day licence in my part of eve 260 millions  so average price for datacores to get even on one account cost gathering datacores 260000 and the account owner isnt getting anything back for the 6 or more months spent creating the characters a average price above 300k would be more credible and i still doubt it would entice people to create datacore gathering accounts  looking the market prices for datacores i would say the average seem to be around 200k so changing this would increase the cost of inventing by at least 30for me it would be an advantage as all my accounts are constantly subscribed but it would be a bad blow for inventors if the goal is higher cost t2 go for it

the system of corporate roles as it presently exists is confusing frustrating and overly prescriptive as a result it is often misused and abused gets in the way of corporation leaders empowering their members as it forces to entrust too much or not enough in many cases and isnt suited to the growing needs for paninteralliance roles partially current system is to blame for closing part of gameplay to majority of players like poss and one of main obstacles in doing the much needed overhaul of management tools like station management tools corporation management tools pos management etcone of the solution would be to move away from the prescriptive model of predefined corporate roles bestowed upon individuals and toward a system of privileges granted to user groups ug defined freely by the players and applied to ingame objectsthe general spirit of the model is inspired by the permissionsaccesses and users management in effect in many forum engines computer storage filesystems and operating systems all tried and true solutions eve users and player organizations managers especially are more likely to be familiar with than any newfangled original modelthis much more sandboxy approach to player selfgovernance inside alliances and corporations is in line with eve overall design and creates a wealth of opportunities for emergent gameplay once players have the tools to create whatever form of social contract they deem appropriate instead of the current onesizefitsnone corporate layout imposed on themdesign goal is to provide more flexibility and a finer granularity in corporation and alliance governance and give players the freedom to decide how they want to organize and rule their own groups as opposed to ccp guessing from the topdown whats best for thema bit more in wiki
allow people to pay for adverts in the scope feed shown on login and billboards make them expensive enough to be worth a gm checkgive us ingame craigslistgive us a ticker and make it easy to subscribe to twitterstyle feeds from alliances corps and individuals in the ticker but do not put ticker adds please
i know it sounds like a weird setup but how about evetv a in game loop broadcast made by corporations bidding on network time commercials etcso and so corp gather the funds from 1015 other corps thus giving them commercial time in the time they have bought to broadcast the only problem i can see is language both its misuse and the barriers between the languages many of the players speak but seeing a caldari news report followed by a gallente sitcom with a minmitar how its made and a amarr 3 am religious broadcast all in game using some kind of looped video would be well awesome perhaps the times could be bought with isk but the shows would have to be reviewed before showingi am sure this would be a pretty good isk sink and a way of expanding the universe as well as giving some of our more creative types a chance to make their shows since none of us look like our characters it would probably all be done in some sort of cartoon or video animation
an excellent idea i would like to add that i think billboards would be better attached to stations in such a way they are visible at the undock point and should display the above proposed ticker purely for immersions sakeindeed for immersions sake i would suggest that constellation chat become the new main channel for local interaction between players in support of your idea that the local channel itself announces spikes in player traffic and further suggest renaming the local channel based on sov eg amarr space gets the amarr certified news acn local channel gallente gets scope local etc and in 00 it changes to unaffiliated or somesuch

no thats bob warfare now they like it instead
this post is full of winif i was participationg in csm election i would vote for younerf local to show total amount of players  or remove it alltogether but first option is good enough  instead on full and free intelor maybe add that cov ops ships that are not showed as total amout of players in new local  stealth bombers and recons should be counted i mean only pure cov opsbut still original idea is satisfying enough
and still we do not address the problem only attempt to avoid the issuethe problem a chat channel is a core source of information on pvp activities  not tools in the game that require skills to use simply a chat channels functionality this detailed information is available from no other source in the game if its going to be adjusted then fix the channel so it works consistently and remove the pvp info to proper sources instead of tweaked to resolve certain issues by exacerbating a faulty implementation simply adding complexity for complexities sake is rarely a decent solution and thats what is done when you expand inconsistencies and inappropriate uses in this fashion dont use tools  watch the chat channel  bunkchat channels should be for chat not for pvp intel and definitely not look and act different in different areas that alone can mess with newer players migrating between the various types of space my recommendation make this a priority review for ccp and drop it squarely in their lap to fix adjust whatever tools need adjusting to smooth out game play and provide equivalent intel but get this chat channel used for chat and not as most are accustomed to using it  whos out thereanother way of looking at it i find nothing advantageous in making highsec seem preferable to lownullsec and having this functionality adds value to staying there vs moving into the rest of the game less impediments to player migration are superior solutions instead of more excuses to stay there
how do i make money in agonypersonal money will be up to you to make and agony pilots are expected to be self sufficient however agony members often go mission running together or ratting in 00 in addition if you want to mine on your own or with some other members go for it living in 00 offers great opportunities to make money in any way you see fit but be warned that we often live in hostile areas where we are usually outnumbered which can make rattingmining next to impossible one of the hardest things our lowerskilled new players have to deal with is making iskthats a quote from agony recruitment you will find this or something similar in most recruitments threads across eve universe as you see as it stands even with local you admit how hard is for new players to self sustain themselfs  yet you propse things that will only make it hard  next to imposibile even for older players and yet its a requierment for recruitment not only in your corpsallianceses but in most 00 have nothing for the player that wants to have isk to self suport himself that cannot be obtained in empire some could argue now that empire income should be nerfed well if both those changes are implemented userbase will go straight down i hope we dont need to argue here right  it will have a huge impact on efficiency and as i see it now more isk  more ships to buy more ships to blow up  more engagements less isk  more cautious approach to pvp  less engagementsno misconception there i just hope my words were not wrongly understood you are doing exceptinally well with the t1 that you fly you emply advanced tactics and win in many situations where odds seem against you and i do know that you fly all typs of ships available just you most often fly t1 ships thats fine w mebut your proposal favors this type of play and only it when proposing somthing with so deep implications in eves universe you should as a csm rep think much wider even tho you were voted by only some you now represent us all i dont expect you not to be biased but i expect to try and see the big picture not a fan of ninja ratting with cloak  and i guess most people arent not much isk being made that way either as it is now covops are a requierment for a good fleet with this proposal they will just be a requierment point as falcons were someday not so long ago well all play covops online dtrue  and i admit i misread  what i read was removing all the local with no ship count at all having a ship count will indeed help in pvp but i still think it will have a nagative impact on pvp itself if anything longer waiting times for scouts to do their job will ruin game for ppl with limited time and scan button grinding will soon wore off any novelty and joy of the new system and btw can you picture how conversations on intel channels will be  there will either be too little info or too much
as far as chat being a tool in intel my opinion that the minimum intel it provides is both needed and not overpowering all the other tools available make intel gathering for a simple task as having an overview of the numbers enemy have extreemly clumbersome picture trying to figure if a fleet thats not on scan  probes or scanner  is blue or not i will for obvious reasons pass asking in local it involves either sharing info about fleets in intel channel with everyone either leaving allies in complete darknessand last argument for now is that its a game focused on combat having intelneed for intel is great but main activity is pew pew anything that leads to less pew pew and more ideling  even if thats for gathering intel  is bad will make alot of players depending on some intel freaks that might find a hobby in gathering intel for a while but they can quit any time in doing so as it is now theres a place for everyone and if you are keen on flying a covop theres a definitive place for you and in fact a constant demand making this a defacto necesity breaks balance
i would venture a guess that full local prevents many more fights than it enables in fact im certain of itthe biggest problem i have with full local is that it makes space feel small even in a 220 au wide system like 92 you can instantly see who and how many are in system tactically it barely matters what system youre in eve is already sadly deficient in environmental variety and full local is a big part of the problemdelayed local would definitely change the nature of pvp in 00 i believe that if we can muster the courage to let go of the sugarteat of instant systemwide intel that we will have a hugely more exciting game full local enables blobs delayed local empowers small fast moving gangs full local benefits large alliances delayed local helps smaller groups full local makes scouting a job for a cloaked at delayed local makes scouting a job for a skilled playerfull local makes 00 boring and predictable delayed local would make 00 exciting and dangerous

i do not have the time to read this entire thread but i agree there are many issues with fw that need fixed i personally believe there is one thing that they can do to fix a lot of the standing issues which can be very simple to domake the militia basically a npc alliance and have it so that regardless of the enemy standings which ever side they are on faction fleet trigger or how ever you want to word itexample gallente fw pilot enters amarr highsec has high amarr standings and does not get attacked by faction navy current mechanics but if the make the militia more like a allaince and have navy respond to all war targets then the above would be that pilot enters the as before but this time gets attacked by faction navybut of course then he would just warp off and log off and the faction navy will stop going after the pilot and the pilot would just relog and have freedom from being attacked by the faction navy since under the current mechanics the navy does not respond to war targets logging into a system only entering the system this is as by design not a bug or exploit and supported by the gms direct representatives of ccpby making the militias more of a alliance and making it so that the npc navy attack all wt regardless of the targets standings it would solve many of the standing issues with both the plexs and pilots entering enemy high sec systems where they have high standing and not being attacked it would also help with the plexing standing issue also by doing this it would make the individual corps that are in fw be more part of the militia in general by allowing other militia pilots and corps to support them while they are being war deced by the big alliances it would make it so that if a none fw corp alliance wants to war dec a fw corp they would have to war dec the militia as a alliance the faction navy not getting involved in such matters this would also allow other members of the militia to support thier comrades in arms which in my opinion should be possable but is not under current mech of the game the militia would not be able to claim any sov since they would be a npc alliancethe other option to the wardecing issue would be to make it so a fw pilot being killed weather in a wardec or not give a faction hit to the pilots killing the fw pilotthat is all for now 2 year old keeps trying to climb in my lap to play with the computer and she is stinky so i have to go for now

it needs work becausethe icon is small and warp scram is the single most important thing in eve after gunsthere is no way to know if you are scrammed or disrupted if i have two targets with points on me but one of them is disrupted their is no way for me to know which one i need to kill to get my mwd workingtheir is no way of knowing how many points i have on me the target could have a single point on me or could have 16 both visual effects and notifications will be the same that needs workhonestly same goes for other types of ewar as well but warp scramming is the single most important one so i suggest say warp scramming icon next to your propulsion ui the one where you set your speed that appears when you are scrammed and if you put mouse over it it says who is scramming you and for how many points also i suggest that on the overview when you put your mouse over the ewar icons it says how0much ewar is on you for example x3 means he has put 3 webbers on me

freighters are one of the cornerstone ships in eve but they lack any type of versatility and thus are extremely dull making freighter pilots have some choice in changing ships attributes could make freighters a bit more interesting but will not remove their intended role or change their survivabilityadding rigs slots to freighters and jump freighters would allow changing some stats of freighters for example adding more cargo capacity at expanse of hp or increasing warp speed even increasing hpnote this change requires other capital ships packaged size attribute to be increased to 13 million m3
i would disagree allowing fittings rigs onto freighters will pretty much lead to only one thing cargo expansion which is certainly not neededyes of course they could increase the packaged size of capitals to prevent them from being hauled into highsec but honestly freighters carry more than enough already courier packages have also been increased in size with dominion addressing somewhat the problem of moving rigged ships aroundwhat i would like to see however is the ability to carry more than just general freight cans with cargo or the ability to put smaller cans into general freight canslikewise i would like to see freightersjforcas made far more nimble waiting 35 minutes undocking from a station just to get aligned is mind numbing or if not more nimble then just plain faster so that if i do choose to autopilot it does not necessitate going to workasleepget laid while you wait for it to arrive five jumps away tho the getting laid part is fun
as a miner i agree to some sort of change along these lines mining should be interactive so that the people who do it as their full time occupation both get something to do and have the botsafk miner competition removedi have noticed many of the people who say no to such suggestion follow their no with i like to mine while i read talk etc for a full blown profession this should not be the case i never hear anyone go while i pvp i like to read watch a movie studyi know it will receive alot of hate from people who either macro alt or only mine some of the time because they find it boring etc but honestly removing these people from the pool of miners will do nothing but make our profession more profitable more fun and more necessary instead of a pass timein fact it may lead to there being more miners since it will not be looked down on as a boring profession
i support this measure while i am against pointless diversions using veins of ore in a roid to increase yield sounds completely feasible if you want afk income play some other game

yep i think it is a good idea maybe the bonus amount needs to be adjusted but i think it is stupid to neglect one of missiles strong points with such a stupid bonuskinetic only bonus should be reserved to caldari t2 shipsand to all those gallente  how would you like it if gallente drone boats only got damage bonus for thermal drones 
cough this has already been repeatedly and conclusively proven to be a completely invalid worthless and indefensible line of reasoning try again if you dont want to be roundly mocked by all people whove actually taken a few minutes to read even some of the arguments on this thread
sorry but this ignorant blanket approach is more deserving of mockery as it does not address what is actually wrong with caldari ie in some cases it is the missiles read roflkets and in others it is not its the ships themselves in other cases still there is no problem and here is the main issue with this idiotic suggestionif implemented this idea would make at least 2 stupidly overpowered ships the drake and the cerb most likely to the point that everyone and his dog would be flying them a fully skilled ham drake doing full around 660 dps with explosive or em damage whilst sporting around an 80k ehp tank is ridiculous they are already very very good while using kinetic this would be far too goodso something would have to give to compensate for this very hi pure dps perhaps a quantity of shield recharge should be stripped from the drake to compensate for the new and improved damage stats how does that sit with racial flavor aspirations  in short leave the drake and the cerb alone they are fine they are better than fine theyre bloody good how they are and stupid suggestions like this will just result in them losing something else when everyone sees how unbalanced theyve become

beside the totally unrelated first row short on valid arguments why the moon mineral price should fall if datacores prices go upunless demand fall there is no reason for the moon minerals price to fall and while an increase in invention cost will probably reduce the relative profit for inventors an increase of some million in the finished product will change little for the t2 ship market and the largest part of t2 components is used in ship production if this change was implemented the ballet between datacore prices and plex prices would be interesting to observe still indifferent to the final outcome
well put
well yes but i gave you a motivation at the end of the day it resolves into cash for cpp the issue is this is the cash from people like me  the cost of the plex ghost rd buys i would say it doesnt make any difference people who ghost rd for plex to fund a second or third account probably wont purchase the gtc any other way if ghost training was removed on the other hand people like me who return and pay for 3 accounts for 6 months with real UFFFD may not reinstate their accounts if theres nothing to get vaguely excited about returning fornone of us here know what the answer is im guessing some accounts were lost due to ghost training being removed ie people didnt return who would have if theyd have been sitting on the sofa bored watching tv one sunday afternoon and suddenly remembered they had carrier v to play with not that it makes a difference of course but you know what i mean i suppose the ghost rd thing is more live because people actually use it to fund their gametime which isnt really the case for ghost training so in a way i can easily see the case for ghost training being in but ghost rd being out is double edged
i and my currently active 5 accounts that could vote do not support this idea it is far too late for that action as i have invested way too mutch time grinding up all those accounts to rd levels
so which of the pro datacore farming voices an alt of awesome possum
my problem with the proposal is that it fails to differentiate between people who take breaks from the game and farmersrmters real money traders you can look at it as a balance between offering incentives for players to return to the game and preventing isk spammercom from datacore farming for profitid love to see the introduction of a ghosting fee whereby you can pay a minimal charge 5 euros or thereabouts to have all passive activities continue while you are not playing the game this would be a better response than the knee jerk remove all ghosting ideas in this thread because the rl cost would outweigh the isk benefits for farmers players who take breaks from eve can purchase an incentive to return you are still paying to play but remove the opposite scenario whereby if i want to continue ghost activities while abroad for work then i have to pay full price without having access to the gamethe nature of eve requires people to play the game for years to build up their character so from a customer retention point of view it makes sense to give people a reason to return when they want to take a break for a few monthsmost players experience the burnout of ctas at silly oclock in the morning or simply get bored of hauling pos fuel etc and one of the smartest things about eve was the way it let you step away from the game but left an incentive to return once your appetite for pod goo had returnedby all means remove ghosting from the game but please be smart about it rather than destroying the unique way eve lets us dip in and out of the game world even when we have real lives to leadedit  started an alternative proposal here
what of blueprint research capital construction jobs market orders and contracts do these not continue and earn income for an inactive account and directly compete with players who are still activecant support something which seems only to the benfit of some players like yourself who seek to eliminate their competition in the name of fairness
the answer to that should be obviousif your not paying and your account goes inactive aside from obvious if not potential cool down like 24 hours or something everything and i mean everything should be suspended and yes i know its not as simple as that but the point is still validit doesnt make sense nor is it fair to us who pay for our accounts even with plexs that we should suffer from a damned ghost exploitationi dont care if you use it as a tool or if your taking a break we cant take breaks from paying our bills neither should youdont like it tough no one said eve was easy to begin with put your back into it and learn what hard work is for a change you can prob afford to buy plexs for all the business you do anyway you being said ghostfarmers and not to anyone directly in this proposal
support fullyinactive acounts should have all activities suspended
i think youre missing the point while the initial proposal was only for ghost datacore production i and several others here have pushed the idea of stopping all activities from an inactive accountfor example when an account goes inactive1 all market orders are immediately expired at the next downtime the goods from those orders are returned to the characters hangar as normal with expired orders2 all blueprint research jobs are canceled the blueprint is thus returned to the hangar it started in and the slot will free up on its own as per normal when a job is cancelledthese are just some examples but the idea that these activities must continue for some reason is ludicrous especially when the game already has logic to cancel the activities in an orderly fashion
i like the idea but i would also like an attack priority for drones aswell ie no point having ogre 2s try and chase down an interceptor something like ignore frigates ignore cruisers type thing id also like there to be a way to set the range the drones orbit the target as well closer for more dps but can be smartbombed further away reduced damage but smartbombs ineffective

the bolded part is the key in pvp the enemy will quickly chew trough your ehp and the few extra hp recharged thanks to the bonus wont even come close to extending your survival time as much as a straight hp boost with no extra recharge would as an example a raven with 3 lse ii 2 invul ii and 3 cdfe has a 119 dps passive tank with 124k ehp mr all level v increase the passive tank by 12 to 131 and max ehp to 134k with 400 dps incomming extremely low even in a 1v1 and assuming that you get max recharge all the time which you in fact doesnt even get close to recharge in the 020 and 50100 or so range is alooot lower it would last 476 seconds with the ehp boost but without the recharge boost compared 460 seconds if its the other way around any increase in dps from there increase the difference even more for example in a 20v20 close range bs fight the raven should expect atleast 15k dps if the hostiles have low skills which the buffer one can take for 9 seconds while the regen one dies in 834 hardly better at all then the base 833 it would get without bonuses having both bonuses clock in at 901and again thats assuming the recharge stays the same the whole way which is not even close to trueehm passive tanks would hardly be effected at all since passive tanks require recharge speed mods to be effective so theyd get that shield in no time anyway passive tanks are for pve though and in pve youre usually solo and not getting bonuses anywayin any kind of pvp id want my main tanking layer to be completely filled at all times that means id be calling for reps as soon as it takes damage that in turn means that it never gets close to peak recharge and getting a fraction of the tiny boost that the bonus gives is extremely insignificantbut buffer tanks are used in situations where you know incomming dps will be so high that any amount you can rep will be insigificant and the only thing that matter is to delay the inevitable so that your friends stand a chanceno i want to get my shield boost just like armour tankers get theirs they get 1015 to all standard armour attributes i want 1015 to all standard shield attributes aswell the fact that high ehpsome passive tank is a shield tanking perk in general not specific to the gang bonus the bonus is supposed to boost every natural part of the tank and recharge is natural for shields

relevant thread in features section issue with planetssummary while new visuals for planets are awesome it is sad to see that when one does show info on them you can find some quite immersion breaking numbers for example several planets that are by the backstory dense populations have temperatures or atmospheric pressure that is not suitable for life as we know it one can also find for example gas giants that are far too light and far too close to their parent stars to be that or ice planets in so tight orbits around their parent stars that the ice should have melting temperatures of lead to remain solid so the proposal is to poke at ccp a bit to get some better planetary models implemented before planetary interaction arrives im not asking it to be lets do phd on it kind of complex and correct but some kind of complex enough model that takes into account a bit more than just calculating surfce temperature of planet as if it has no atmosphere and then deciding its atmospheric pressure entirely by random number generator for example something like stargen modified to better suit the eve universe it would be especially awesome if same model would be applied also to moons
i will support my proposal ofc as will be all my alt accounts

minor and low priority but planets that adhere to the laws of the universegravitation density etcwould be nice if it can be redone automatically im for it  i wouldnt wish that many calculations on a human but if a computer is doing it sure
i support an overhaul of corporation roles it needs lots of work on the ui making it more user friendly as well as adding more roles and being more adjustable to the needs of the corporation now it is often either too much or too little things like spending limits on wallets limitations to grantable wallet divisions as well as setting limits on the number of transactions that can occur in a time period 24hr 48hr week etc it is silly that so many roles are weak in their customization and security for a corporation
very much supported
i agree with this wholeheartedly in fact i posted an idea similar to this in one of my omnibus postsidea omnibus 2 idea 1if you want more background as to why the role system is the way it is now it was discussed a little bit in this thread in four words 64 bit role flagsupported
oh lordno pun intended i support this so very much while were at it can we get anchor new pos and unanchor old pos split along with install corp industry jobs and cancel other peoples corp industry jobs because i hear that those would both be kind of convenient
im all for improvement on the corp interface and roles here are some of my ideas on the subjectoffice roles corporation improvement this was to allow definable groups of offices to go with headquarters other and based atrelated but not the same it was asking for an option to set a corp contract to a title or divisioncorp contracts to titles
yes definitely the corp roles interface needs a complete overhaul
the corp interface is probably the most difficult to use and most confusing part of the entire game it desperately needs fixing
yeah this has been necessary for a long long time
supported any and all warnings should be able to be disabled
supportedi sense a jump in black ops prices when announced
you just quoted something that supports my argument 00 is dangerous so we encourage our members to take precautions the self sufficiency thing is purely there to make it clear that agony as a corp wont be supplying free shipsand with the proposed compromise of local showing a count but without the free character intel it wouldnt change the difficulty in most situations local goes up you bug outthat argument would hold water if people with billions of isk were throwing their ships around 00 with wild abandon that is certainly not something we see on a daily basis the majority of fleets we see pvping in 00 are in either 520 person light gangs or 50100 blobs people are already risk adverse even when flying fully insured battleships for example but this leads on to the whole point of changing local which is to make it more likely to get a fight in the first placecase in point we have a fleet on a gate and put a scout into the next systembefore our scout has even come out of black screen session change he has appeared in local and anyone there knows his corpalliance and even corp historyif they have a scout in our system or any system along the route then without having to do anything more than look at local they know how many people we haveat this point based only on free intel from local they will leave the system the scout entered and we get no fight at allthe two points are1 a single scoutalt in a system can tell the size of a fleet moving through it without having to lay eyes on it either via being on grid at a gate or via the ship scanner just local and clicking on a few portraits2 people get intel on somebody new in system before that person has even finished session change and thus get a head start on their next moveexcept that once again you are under the incorrect assumption that we mostly fly cheap t1 ships im not going to waste my time responding to you if you continue with this claim that im only supporting t1 ship pvpi didnt raise the proposal but i am looking at the big pictureyou claim this proposal is aimed at stopping easy isk in 00 so you have to fly t1 in pvp that is utter rubbishthe idea is to open up more tactics in 00 but you are blind to that
what you are saying is that without the ability to know exactly who is in system you cant pvp it is true that without a hostile force there isnt anything to shoot at but you shouldnt have the safety net when encountering a small gang of knowing that they have reinforcements in system unless you spotted them firstthis kind of rubbish is what encourages hot drops and even login traps i dont support people using login traps and agony dont do them but it does highlight the problem full local creates in getting a fightwhy should you know if anyone in system isnt blue to you without having to take some actionit amuses me you talk about eve being all about pvp then bring up blues and allies which are more great ways to remove opportunities for fights in 00 and an attempt to make it safe somebody else who sees the bigger picture i agree with this 100there will always be resistance to changemaking black op drops more viable is certainly something i support

sensible

agreed im not a fan of the gang module effects either
agree 100 and while your at it kill eccm effect for the love of god
whatever you think of his moral codeand im no fan of it myself this is not the venue for you to be attacking it show some decorum and deal with the issue at hand op your preamble is making you no friendsremember this is a game noted for the fact that its mean and nasty and full of piracy and scams  what sort of gaming code do you think the average player keeps to but i am of course in favour of bugs being fixed supported
im in favour of bug fixes too i just felt the irony had to be pointed out my own fw experience was somewhat lackluster
supporting the umpteenth fw thread op there are a few threads that list some of the major issues in fw  please consider supporting themecho on the timers running in empty plexes doesnt mean it is intentional  though im sure sometimes it isecho on the preamble yawn
technically he said that a requirement of the game is that it does not force the player to commit wrong or evil acts not that he would never commit onehe may be out killing people in the name of a brutal theocratic slaver regime but he could be sitting in a station reselling frozen food if he wanted to
i think the eris and should get more hybrid bonuses instead of the 5 bonus to rocket and light missile thermal damage per level of interdictors skill give it a 5 bonus to small hybrid turret damage for the interdictors skill bonus also give it 7x turret hard points and the option for 2x missilerocket hardpoints tho still only keeping the 8 higslots naturally limiting it like this will not only limit the hybrid dps and still still have the ability to carry missiles but it will also bring it in line with the saber i mean the saber dont have any missilerocket bonus the gallente shouldnt eather after all they the gallente use hybrids more so then missilesrocketsnow the flycatcher and heretic is fine because caldari and amarr both can use missesrockets anyway i just think adjusting the eris in this way makes more scene that way the game has 2x missile based interdictors and 2x turret based ones
up lets sabre fly with arti  launcher give gallentean hybrids
there should exist ships in all races that take people to using missiles drones and turrets this is mostly done but gallente missile ships are the single rarest of those categories they dont need a further nerfing
i am new to this forum and honestly to lazy to look around for a possible thread already out thereif there is one feel free to point it out but otherwise i am going to say my piece basically i am sure every lowsec pirate out there has caught a capital doing something stupid a ratting b kickout station c other stupid things that shouldnt be done in a capitalwell i dont know how often i have been involved in killing a capital that self destructs and cheats us a killmail i would like to make a few changes that hopefully people like and ccp will consider in the next patcha increase self destruct time on capitals to 510 mins longb require you have no agression when you before initating self destructc the last person to shoot a capital who initates self destruct before it blows gets the killmail just my thoughts
a a titan doesnt need 510minutes to kill it  scnr the idea is stupidb is just stupidc that i could supportbut mixing 3 proposals into one makes it hard really to tick the support checkboxthinking more about it  if it would be c at all the final blow should go to a special self destruction player and you should be just listed at involved and of course it shouldnt list any fitting and stuff i mean if we do it at all as other said  it is a valid tactic  and you should stop crying for your missing epeen extension
denying your enemy or a griefer their precious km is important 1 they dont get to learn how you fit the ship2 they have less chance of getting valuable modules to use against you3 all science fiction media supports the idea of selfdestruct and even in the real world scuttling ships to deny the enemy is also an optionhow about we get rid of killmails the game could improve without that sort of player whose only motivation is to have one
if you caused it to selfdestruct then you accomplished what you were looking to do stop playing killboards online because this isnt that game and as griefer pirates love to spew to carebears stop worrying about pixels a killmail on a board and just play the game
this killmail denial valid
self destruct timers for larger ships do need looking at and this isnt just a case of griefers wanting kms lolololright now if you self destruct you are having your cake and eating it you deny loot deny the km and you can claim your insurancewith reference to titans to bring down a modestly tanked one 40mil ehp in two minutes requires 300k dps roughly 100 dreads as such the only titans we will see die in dominion with the current mechanics are those who want to diehowever the ops suggestions require some work
nope if i choose to deny you the satisfaction of getting your epeen extension while still losing my ship that is my rightdont like itwow is that way
i swear i wish ccp would just start forum banning people who bring this up cant we retire this thread like they retire peoples jerseys in sports
im sorry but i refuse to believe that scuttling your own ship is an overpowered technique that needs a nerf in any imaginable context its fine mess around with who gets killmails maybe but dont change the mechanics theyre fine
another well known eve player is struck down by this rediculous system 
you know ive bought and sold some characters ade some good isk but ive also been burned by this issue so even though it means a loss of a bloodyton of isk for me i support itbeing banned once for buying a character is really enough
yes
i think this proposal is a great example of the old metaphor about cutting off your nose to spite your face trying to harm rmters by banning legitimate sales of characters is like trying to harm rumrunners by banning legitimate sales of alcohol how well do prohibitions of things people want ever work out one of the things ccp has done with this game that is genuinely intelligent is to cut the legs out from under the ebay crowd by letting you trade cash for items and characters in a way that does not let anyone try to earn a profit off of their game people are going to buy these things whether you allow it or not banning it wont stop it from happening itll just force more people into using sketchier means of it that leave them open to scams and help rmters yes sometimes people steal an account and sell the characters obviously this is a problem that ought to be dealt with but trying to ban character sales because they are occasionally used wrongly is a  ate sugar argument its absurd on its face this wont do what youre trying to do itll just inconvenience a lot of people who have done nothing wrong and help the people youre trying to hurt this is a bad idea
ah i get it this is a joke thread and im the silly billy trying to get people to provide evidence supporting their claims 
freedom of speech support
i may not browse these forums enough to see all of this overzealous moderation because from my perspective the moderators only censor things which are not supposed to be posted on the forums usually1 discussion on moderation2 kill mails and killboard links3 chatlogs4 trollsi see plenty of posts out there which are negative about ccp yet they remain in place it is my opinion that people could easily avoid being moderated by simply not being raving lunatics post in a calm and concise manner dont break the rules and the mods will be much kinder to you
yeah i said itwith dominion getting a foothold against a coalition member is impossible no matter how far away his coalition friends are guerrilla warfare give me a break all endgame pvp comes down to is who has more friends this would be fine and dandy if the game supported this by fixing the node issues but with the game as it is gargantuan blobssystem breaking blobs just arent funimo you should get benefits by attacking from multiple fronts and using the element of surprisejust like real warfare but with all the rf timers you and your enemy have way too much time to gather all your friends together to have one giant lag party this imo is one of the major drawbacks of eve even moreso with dominionwith dominion the dreadful 2 massive powerblocs system is what 00 spaceholding is focused on by giving both sides way too much time to travel to their friends region before any real foothold is gotten this should changeguerrilla warfare should have room in eve not just giant honorable lagfests us lost the vietnam war due to smart tactical decisions utilizing guerrilla warfare why cant this happen in eve
in vietnam the guerilla tactics were aimed at smallish groups of guys in the jungle not at major base complexes or american cities every time the north vietnamese tried to take on the equivalent of an outpostmajor system belonging to the americans they got pulverized why should it be any different here a guerilla force cannot fight a setpiece battle and any conquest of a major piece of real estatelike an outpost or tcu is going to be a setpiece battle if you want to fight a guerilla war gank miners and ratters
i suggest you read up on the vietnam war thenthat said im not saying to get rid of reinforce timers altogether just cut them down so you can get a small foothold so that by the time faraway reinforcement troops from the coalition arrive they have a tough job ahead for them and not just one day of fighting something more resembling the way the game was before dominion
supporting this truncating decimals is a terrible way of doing it
of all the things id like the csm to talk to ccp about in the hopes of getting it done i wouldnt waste any of these peoples time with this there are a dozen things i personally dont care about id rather see addressed over this
they have three days this would take two minutes seems worth it to avoid confusing the newbies
does that really matter i mean seriously even if you dont see the decimal its still applied and doesnt offer any benefits if made visible other than to brag youve got another 92
when i start a new game especially one as poorly documented as eve still is i try to figure out how it all ticks now i personally had friends who were already playing when i started so i didnt have to figure out the skill training system for myself if i had been doing it solo though i know it would have driven me up the wall none of my math would have worked and id have been rather frustrated by the whole affair yes its minor yes its a small change but it would be beneficial  not everyone thinks the same way you do
i do agree that freighters should not be given rig slots but i do however think they need a warp speed increase 7 aus on a 110 au warp
i for one would rather add rigs to increase warp speed and agility then cargo maybe even give more hp for ones i use in 00 but atm you dont have any optionchoice with freighters
simple complaintfreighter bouncing off of gates  flying sideways at 1000ms for 20km is not fun when you have to realign  reapproach for the next five minutes
noif we added rigs to freighters cargo rigs would bring freighter cargo holds over 1000000mUFFFD which will lead to people being able to move packaged cap ships through andor into high secedit grammorzzz
id like to see modifications to the freighters as well but i dont think the addition of rigs is necessary implants can achieve some of the same results i would like to see the addition of a ship hanger to the freighter to haul rigged ships
versatility for a freighter pilot is provided by the fact that the freighter pilot is also a transport ship hauler and jump freighter pilot i see no reason to mess up a perfectly reasonable ship class just to let people fly the same boring ship with slightly different stats i dont support this
i like the ideaid like a slide bar or a tick box that would allow me to change the freighter from cargo space to ship maintenance for moving rigged ships around
freighters are balanced just fine no need to change them
easy soloution nerf cargo and boost armour just enough so that a full rack of cargo optimizers gives the same stats as today and atleast personally i hardly ever come even close to filling my obelisk so id much rather fit agility and warp speed rigshowever i dont think its a big deal i wouldnt mind if it got implemented but i wont be holding my breath for it either
as warp speed rigs are percentage based those are rather uselesssame as warp speed implants hy012 agility might be something but isnt that why we have webbing frigates
theyre not supposed to be versatile silly
a freighter is designed to be just that a huge box with thrusters that you throw all your crap in to move itadding rig slots opens up the possibility for all sorts of new game breaking mechanics such as cargo expansion rigs that take the hold volume above 1000000m3 allowing them to haul certain capital shipsitd cause more issues than solutions and the holds on freighters are large enough as they are
y is everyone hung up on caps just put a popup about it violating the convention that regulated wars as for cargo im left making multiple runs daily to get the ore and produced goods to market allowing some customization would not unbalance the game
not supporting im a jf pilot and even i see this as a major problemthe only thing i would suggest as a buff is to allow freighters to transport ships that are rigged you may not be able to pack as much as you wantbut it would solve alot of problemsand possible the allowance of packing containers other than gfc as ive realized its a real pain in the  except the secure cans for obvious reasonsbut your generic cargo can fer crying out loud
a simple proposaltl dr the csm should propose to ccp that it should increase the visibility of the keylogging threat and act against it how should this be done simple 1 highdensity placement of warnings about the danger of having your account stolen not on the website but in game probably on log in or on the character select screen 2 a subcommittee preferably of csm members or trustworthy members of the community with good computing skills is set up to review freeware programs with the facility to guard against keyloggers and suggest the optimal one to encourage everyone to get 3 ccp will create an optional pin system for logging into the game  mr worried logs into eve and hears about the keylogging threat  mr worried creates a pin by a button on his character selection screen he is presented with a standard 09 keypad with the numbers on each randomized so that there is no way to record what pin he is entering the numbers are randomised on each pin entry which can only be done via mouseclicks  mr worried relogs into eve to access his character select screen he must reinput his pin onto the randomised keypad this pin system will guard against most common keyloggers and is a system already present in at least one other mmorpg
this most handsome and intelligent man is indeed correct i must support him for he is obviously a vastly superior lifeform to myself indeedyes this is the op supporting himself
working for a large company we use a small keyring that randomly generates a random 8 digit random code every 30 min would be an optional thing you could buy ofcourse i think they sale them for like 15 for other programs i think wow has them other option would be an encrypted usb type drive that has a hardcoded password written inside it ofcourse you lose it you will need to get cust service to get you on the password system until you get a new device
if you think mining is boring and needs a more interactive boost you should do something else in the game mining is boring pvp is not other things are somewhere inbetween pveinvention etc there are plenty of things in eve to do if you get bored or burnt out on something try something different it isnt rocket science to change career paths if you dont like what you are doing
classic if you think mining is boring then you should pvp instead of actually throwing in some useful information or making a vote mining is a profession unless your a pirate pvp is a passtime or a necessity because of pirates
they are actually looking into a new system for mining called planetary ring mining as well as comet mining they talked about it last fanfest here were the highlightsplanetary ring miningscan down veins of rare orenew resourcesmore engaging and interactiverediscover that goldrush feelingplayer skill and intuition counts which is bad news for the macro minerscomet miningscan them downricher comets in wspacethey contain organic compundspossibly alternative release valve to moon gooscoop up their ejaculate
i like the idea of interactive so ill support itbut i would like to see it this wayyou lock on to a roid and start your stripmining lasera random mini 10 sec vein lock game now startsafter the game is over the mining startswhen the mining starts a new vein yield game starts now you can choose to play this game for more yield 50100or go readingwatching tvplaying on 2nd account or keep an eye on local but not getting the extra yieldthis way1 macro mining becomes impossible 2 all afk miners can stil do there thing3 activemain profession miners get more funyieldiskthis way everyone wins
way to troll because all the words strung together making sentences expressing thoughts in my post there just said go pvp clever how i did that the posts below yours actually address the issue as have other posts including my original one fantastic that the only way to make the one thing you do mine fun is to change it because it is so boring to you who loves it so much i love you but can you stop being so much likewell youi have no problem if a solution to your and the ops problem is to make other ways of mining as a post under your comment mentions plans of ccps or something similiar but as i originally stated making me do more work for the same reward is stupid and not supported when i read people talking about mini games and puzzles with mining i get these nasty thoughts about the intelligence of these people and feel they should quit eve and load up minesweeper or maybe just open a new window to do that somehow doing anything extra that ccp doesnt make to entertain you while you do this boring thing you love is really wrong and if they came up with a way to entertain you more while you do the thing you love so much then it would be okay sounds kind of silly to meto reiterate there are lots of things in eve to do if you find mining boring or tiresome etc try try try something else there are many other so called professions that you can do actually there are lots of activities but people like to call them professions for some reason
helloplease forgive me if there was a similar topic but i think that i stumbled upon something great dmy idea is that mining could have new improvement  mining platforms at this point many people cry that miners get rich while playing the game afk away from keyboard so this new feature could be a step in a right directionin my opinion mining platforms could be mobile anchor able items that takes a lot of cargo hold and can be anchored only in a hauler maybe something like 1027k m3 at this point mining platform should offer greater yield than hulks or other effects because other way they wont be used so at this point it should have factors that would force miners to pay attention while operating these mining platforms maybe some anchoring times changing target times and etcthe paying attention thing would be that these mining platforms would use subsystems just saying what the game has these subsystems would decide on these mining platforms effects also they should use 1 crystal at the time like core crystal it would decide on yield and would take time to change so you should pick your asteroids with that in mind also mining platforms should have addable modules like miners shield improvements cargo expanding and etc these modules would be decided by used subsystems sorry got carried away abit but the attention thing would be enforced by that that these platforms would use fuel there would be platforms for each race with different bonuses and use racial pos fuel only ice products also it would use cooling liquid to cool lasers there is such thing in eve items just dont know how to spell it also people would operate these platforms from their ship which should be 15 or 25 km from it it would have some interface where person should look on readings and press some buttons accordingly for example when temperature reaches certain amount he must order cooling liquid to be used maybe some critical situations could be implemented some asteroids could be harder lasers could break if systems arent cooled when needed some subsystemsmodules could micro explode losing its bonuses till it heats too much and the platform explodes itself when i say readings i mean more than 2 or 3 things to watch and react accordingly maybe you would have to increasereduce reactors power to some of the lasers some would require more power if they would be better or harderabout the modules in it they should be able to improve the yield cargo hold shields armor and etc my idea is that these mining platforms wouldnt have big cargo hold and that it would require hauling the minerals out of it of course you could make the cargo hold bigger by sacrificing some shields or yield or something maybe these platforms could have cloaks while you haul it but they shouldnt have pos type shields because belts arent your property  maybe you could operate or unanchor it by typing in a password maybe in low sec people could try to hack the locksdue to my offered subsystem way this could be t3 of miningas this would be totally new thing it would lets say require new category of skills  platform operation what can you know if thought right you could make more platforms how about platform shops where people can approach and look at your items viliasas ng drug store in the end i just would like to say that this would be a great thing if implemented right and it would be really cool d i want it if it would be implemented i probably didnt covered all of it as i have trouble expressing my thoughts but it would be more like pos guns where people man them and they get its bonuses these items should be manned all the time and should disappear after dt if left just thought about shop platforms and they should be thought about differently  who wants to lose its items if forgotten after dt
reservedps in my opinion the main idea is good my offered implementation probably not so good but i think you have your own minds to comment on whats bad or good and how could it be changed
this pretty much sounds like an orca or some sort of hulk  rorqual  strategic cruiser mixtoo confused either way sono supportin other words more paragraphs andjustdont do this again
in my opinion this could be more fun way to mine  this would require more attention i believe it could be made so that people would chose from this and hulk
sounds like something that is oriented towards corporations more than single miners the idea is nice but i dont see how that would really be practical a mining fleet with an orca is already a force to be reckoned with this adds more complexity and logistics for as far as i can see nothing that would make it more interestingi think a mining structure of some kind could be useful but i dont see any implementation that would really make sense just now
as i thought about this i had it in mind as for single player not corporation or alliance if this structure would offer greater rewards for single players it might be used
tech 2 orca perhaps what would that be humpback whale 8 but no not supportingmining profession as a general rule of thumb is not supposed to be an uber solo gig it starts out as a solo job but only works if you have a cooperative or more than one altaccount to do the job propermining should only be profitable when your doing so in a team situation not soloif it was a solo job then it would be all to easy to go npc and mine the crap out of everything and empty entire systems of belts no way not ever
proposalintroduce a cheap subscription that allows passive activities to continue while you are away from the gamesuggested cost 5 eurosperceived problempassive activities such as skill training market orders agent rp and research jobs are damaging to the game if they continue on unsubbed accounts because it encourages isk farming and aggravates some paying customerson the other hand eve is a long term hobby and ghosting is an important aspect of the game to many of us who like to take breaks away and reinvigorate our lust for pod goo the trend towards removing ghosting from the game decreases the incentive to resubscribe after a couple of months awaysuggested implementationif you have not bought a sub then all activities related to your character would stop a server side file would be attached to your account to record any market orders research jobs etcon resubscribing your orders would be placed back on the the market and any research jobs would automatically que up in the the shortest available slot skill training and rp collection would resumeif you have bought ghost a sub then you would not be able to log in to the game but your account would ghost in the same way as before ghost training was removed and youd have access to the forums the ghost sub could be upgraded to a full sub at any point
seriously stop trolling
i assume your one line troll was a very bad attempt at irony slanders an enjoyable part of eve but please be constructive toothere are many military personnel and others working away from home who would benefit from this not to mention people who want to take a break
if you had bothered to read up on previous attempts to change the policy on this particular subject you wouldnt have bothered to even tryif you continue to pay for your subscription no one is to stop you from taking a break aside form changing skills its that simpledont pay it should be suspendedccp has already gone over this its not my fault your refusing to read whats put in front of youso either your trolling or your blindly posting proposals that have been refused many times beforewould be nice if i could take a break from my electrical bill for hours at a time would be nice to take a break from my car payments or my loan paymentswow gee golly wiz welcome to the real worldeve online has enough problems with people cutting corners and not putting in a valid hard work effort short of the isk farming thats going on we dont need it to be any worsewhat you ask for may be valid but in reality people will make new accounts queue them up and then abuse the system to hell and back ccp shut it off for that very reason
for some strange reason it was removed a few patches ago its actually in the patch notes i found it very useful when wanting to drop offices granted it wasnt something we used all the time but it was used
htf under the current mechanic do you cancel rent on an office other than just stop paying and now that you can set payments to be automatic its either all offices or none
yeah this would be a nice change
i see no reason that the drake needs a boost
yeah this seems like a weird little corner case they didnt think of i support changing it
yes
sadly ccp has pretty much broken my will to champion blaster fixes that they so badly need i now have large pulse spec 5 and soon to have large autocannon spec 5itll take nothing short of a miracle to get me out of my mach and into my vindi given the current state of the game

i have a moral problem with this textthat implies that when you cannot pay bills and therefor cannot play eve other players should not be able to play eve eitherwhile i agree with disabling ghost training and ild agree with disabling ghost datacores i will vote against the op if that quote up here is the main issue
i think youre misunderstanding drake hes not that big a jerk luvs ya drakei think what he emans is that if youre not playing the game and therefore not paying for it you shouldnt get a benefit from it the same as if you dont pay your electric bill you dont get the benefit of having electricity
not the issue being discussed and the problem with this is if you forget to change payment methods or otherwise fund your account be it a day or several before you can pay ccp everything you had going on gets canceled make a mistake get wrapped up in real life issues and congratulations we cancelled all your orders research manufacturing etc welcome back to me that is stupid you pay for market orders you pay for researchmanufacturing jobs anything you pay for should continue until completion or the account is removed by ccp not ludicrous at all to meresearch points are not something you pay for directly like any of the above you train some skills build up standing and say lets work on something then you are given rp throughout the day over and over till you cash them in or stop your research with the agent while i disagree with the removal of ghost trainingon principle it is done getting something for nothing direct pay is what ccp said they dont offer ninja edited but still so removing the collection of rp on inactive accounts when you turn them back on is a logical step along with the ghost training nerf i support this idea because it works with the system of no gain for no pay on inactive accounts which is what rp collection and skill progress on unpaid accounts are market orders and research are paid for with isk and set to end by their nature

this part was supposed to be posted right after the one above but seems like the forum ate ita straight up hp boost with nerfed recharge time to balance out the increased hp in regards to hp rechargedsec would indeed be alot better even though both should be given imo due to what i wrote right above thisno recharge is not a natural feature of armour like it is for shields so making it give an unnatural bonus should require specialized mods aka wafrare links however it is indeed very insignificant so i dont care much either wayehp is indeed not the same as hp but it scales with it ehp  how much damage you can absorb without having to resort to repairing in any way your definition of regen and repair rate is also ehp as they are also hp that the incoming dps has to defeat is pretty much unique hugo summed it up very well
passive tanking shield ships will receive the bonus to shield regeneration making their tank heavier exceptionally heavier on some shipsactive tanking shield ships will simply boost the 215 of missing shieldsarmor tanking ships cannot regenerate armor which is why their armor is added passively without reducing the current amount until you want to give armor bonus two upsides as the shield bonus has perhaps a 175 resistance modifier this is not a reasonable approachbasically shields get regeneration and max shields armor just gets max armor
it seems to me that the correct solution has already been pointed out  make the bonuses persist in some way between sessionshow about this as a proposal when the shield level is greater than 100 the shield should decay towards 100 at the current shield recharge rate rather than disappearing instantaneouslyi suggest leaving shield reset on docking as it is

thats what having blues and neutrals is all about make nullsec a safer place and kick out all the pirates go kill your own corpmates if you want a fight that bad and leave the peaceful inhabitants alone they havent done anything to youhaving to take some action to see if someone is red or friendly can go two ways 1 make it too easy or just right the pirates get some free kills until everyone learns to spam said action often enough and then were back at the current situation but youve introduced a grind thanks 2 make it too hard peaceful inhabitants lose ships left and right pack up and leave bye bye targets welcome big empty stretches of boring spaceeither way i see nothing in the proposal that would benefit the defender only nerf them by introducing a grind the only winners are the attacking partysomebody else who sees the bigger picture i agree with this 100there will always be resistance to changemaking black op drops more viable is certainly something i support
ive been thinking about this and the cloak arguments for a while i think theres a fairly simple solution allow players to close local like they can any other chat channel this would prevent them from showing up in the local list but only at the cost of not being able to use it themselves
i am a mostlypeaceful denizen of 00 and i disagree this change would benefit me and my corp mates hostiles would no longer have instant knowledge of our presence in a system ask yourself does removing the menu benefit the hungry person or the steak
really good idea me wants

to include the payout proposal by mister xeroxi propose a bounty system for eve which cannot be abused and will make revenge for being killed by pirates possible for any victim1 a bounty can only be assigned to a pilot who is on the kill list of the bounty assigning pilot thus by a pilot who was killed by one or more other pilots hogun rath suggested to allow bounties on pos attackers as well im not really comfortable with that but if it is generally liked why not 2 the bounty assigning pilot adds a bounty to those pilots on his kill list he wants to be hunted down with a minimum of 10 mil isk per pilot3 this bounty will be converted into a public contract using the existing contract system4 any bounty hunter can accept the contract with a collateral of 1 mio isk this part could probably just be dismissed because it does not really add to protection of the bounty hunting system against abuse5 there will be a bounty hunter license social skill rank 5 or higher with fast talk at lvl 5 as a prerequisite and the ability to accept 1 active bounty per skill level6 the acceptance of the contract and the payment of the collateral will become valid only if the bounty offering pilot again positivly acknowledges the acceptance of the bounty contract by the bounty hunter7 the contract if accepted will be valid only for the one bounty as contracted not for all bounties on the target pilot thus there can be more then one bounty contract per pilot on the market8 the bounty hunter can then hunt without concord interference in all systems will get the bounty he has offered to collect if successful plus the collateral9 the bounty hunter will have one week to fulfil the contract otherwise it will be nullified and the collateral will go to the bounty assigning contractorif no collateral this part would go10 the payout would be the default insurance value of the ship destroyed to avoid any possible exploit this is deducted from the payout if any received by the destroyed target this continues until the entire bounty has been acquired11 to avoid exploitative use of altpodding a useless clone the maximum payout for a pod kill is the value of updating the clone deducted from the bounty not the pilot12 the contract is open public and acceptable anytime until the bounty is collected meaning that multiple bounty hunters can accept it but only the ones on the killmail will collect the collateral when more then one bounty hunter is on the killmail all will get an equal share of the bountywith this system a profession of bounty hunters will introduced to the game and offer a noncriminal way for pvpers to earn isk while pvping for the justice side it will make pirating much more risky and will not be able to be abused because only pilotes who have managed to deliver killrights to a pilot they have attacked can be loaded with a bounty and only pilots who have invested in being skilled and have the acceptance by the bounty assigner can collect the bounty

yeh ill support thismy only concern is the what slots it will uselike could you have 5 damage mod for all guns 5 for large racial plus 5 for all drones then another 5 for lightmedium heavysentrya tracking implant might fit in there as well but i havent really looked into that atm especially on a domi which from what ive heard can run lv4 missions in under a monthbut otherwise i support this
drone implantsslot 6 grants a 135 bonus to light scout drone damageslot 7 grants a 135 bonus to sentry drone damageslot 8 grants a 135 bonus to medium drone damageslot 9 grants a 135 bonus to all drone damageslot 10 grants a 135 bonus to sentry drone damageother possible implants could increase the mining amount of miner drones trackingoptimal of combat drones base speedarmor even increase the attributes of the utility ewar and logistics dronespersonally id rather see one implant for lightmedium drones and one implant for heavysentry drones using the same slot that way you have to choose between the two sets which in all honesty wouldnt be a huge choice really
two daughters no seriously youre right support
1 for this idea i always hated the eris for that stupid missile bonusalso similar name
i agree ccp should make this modification to this ship things would be more balanced that way
definitely agree gallente training and ships are not missle boats so why give it missile bonus
i have seen many people try to come up with ideas on how to encourage people to go into lowsec and nulsec and wormhole space more because what is it about 90 of players stay in empirewell the reason is because you can make easy money and lots of it in empire without all the risks why go lose ships or risk it in dangerous space now so many stay in empire the markets are saturated and isk accounts overflowif ccp removed all the mining belts from empire space and raised taxes on loot salvage profits from missions etc people could still enjoy the game and when they want to make serious money they would need to join a corp and go into dangerous territory call it a crackdown on pod pilots by the empires seriously though want to fix the market want to get more people into nulsec lowsec wspace and still have the option to have fun and enjoy the game in empire remove all the big money grind options out of empire before it is too latesign below please 
lol what shouldnt this have been titled lowering ccps bottomline
oh yes lets see how where ship prices will settle with that 300m megas anyoneincreases all prices in verge by 10 to test drive d
sure lets remove 70 of the playerbase maybe more considering the pirates wont be able to support their habit with alts lets also remove concord and the faction navies while were at it brilliant idea sarcasmnerfing any major populous always spells trouble for any game ccp are smarter than that
plus how many 00 pvpers have alts in highsec making them isknot supported
bad idea
the attitude of lownullsec players needs to changelets face it you dont want more people in your systems you want more lolfit noobs on your gatecampscva genuinely wanted more people in their space they turned a chunk of nonempire space into a semiliveable area with some semblance of order and security most people dont thrive on anarchy and chaos most nonempire space is nothing but anarchy and chaosso long as nonempire space is 99 populated by campers pirates and gankers looking for cheap kills you can forget about any significant number of empire carebears moving out there
the whole character trading is bs i understand that its a good thing for ccp as it creates income for older players and gives newer players a leg up but for the game and the whole idea of a long term mmo where your actions makes you character its just bad i have several high level sp chars whos account i simply closed but wouldnt think of selling even though ill never use them againits not neccesarily linked to rmt but the whole semidirect isk for money ccp deliberately removing the ingameoutgame boundaries and character trades is just bullcrap ccp should stop giving in to more and more of this  whats next buy 2 plex and you can redeem a special ship that gives you 5 to strength
you know what the single most common complaint about eve i hear from nonplayers is you mean i can never catch up to an old player that sucks character trade is the solution to this if you prefer your characters not be sold you dont have to sell them  i had a corpmate who biomassed his two best characters instead of selling them when he quit playinghe wanted to stop himself from coming back because he didnt think 20 bil in the hands of his friends was worth parting with the characters he had created that was his choice and i respected it but if he hadnt cared what would have been wrong with him passing them along to someone who could have used them also its hardly just profit for old players if theres someone in my corp who wants to buy isk over the long term the way i tell them to do it is to make 51day trial accounts build a hulk pilot sell it on day 50 then start again with another account generally its an old player buying it and giving a new player money in any case plexcharacter sales are a perfectly reasonable form of trade and ccp has managed to get all the benefits of them without most of the drawbacks of uncontrolled rmt its a brilliant system and i am completely against it being neutered just because it offends your sensibilities
not supportedi think there are workable compromises which would allow legitimate character sales to take place while still excluding account hackers they have only a relatively short space of time to arrange a character sale before a petition goes through and a stolen account is frozenfor example how about adding an accountwide no character transfers for the next x months option with no means of cancelling once set this is only 1 idea  there must be other possibilities
agreed just abandon the character sales screw you people that sell and buy chars to amass your isk in game some of us earn it by playing the game rmt via char transfers will do serious harm much more so than character transfers been dragged  underground  as someone said simple thing is this so many people are only trading chars etc simply because ccp is making it so damn easy  legal to do
outright stopping character sales would be a doubtful move and im unsure of the exact implicationsbut nonetheless something needs to be done

i propose to introduce a universal rank system for eve which applies to all pilots flying for a npc corporationthe ranks will be distributed along the certificates achieved by a pilot although those are not flawless they are good enough for that with a point value of 1 point for a basic certificate 2 points for a standard certificate 4 points for an improved certificate 8 points for an elite certificatein total a maximum point value of 887 points can be achieved when having acquired all certificates in game a higher ranking certificates nullifies the point value of its prequelthere will be 10 ranks for pilots which will be more civilian labeled than the faction war ranks to stipulate the mostly industrial character of pilots flying for npc corporations trainee pilot  0  20 points junior pilot  21  60 points 237 of max point value regular pilot  61  120 points 688 of max point value senior pilot  121  200 points 1364 of max point value expert pilot  201  300 points 2266 of max point value adept pilot  301  420 points 3393 of max point value master pilot  421  560 points 4796 of max point value elder pilot  561  720 points 6325 of max point value sage pilot  721  886 points 8129 of max point value omniscient pilot  887 points 10000 of max point valuethere is a progression in the limits to get promoted resulting in quicker promotions at the beginning of a pilots career and a considerable slowing down at the higher ranks the leading value ist the percentage of the maximally achievable point value to allow for adaptions in the course of possible future changes of the certificate system however a rank once achieved should not be taken away again because of a system changethe classification of ranks can be justified as described belowtrainee pilot cadet levela young pilot having just left the pod pilot school with his first few certificates on the way to achieve the first followup certificates to fly small ships and use the respective modules weaponry and rigs for it reasonably welljunior pilot regular pilot senior pilot commissioned officer levelpilots generally reasonably to well specialised on a certain role as trader miner and refiner inventor and producer explorer or fighting pilot or aspiring generalist pilots starting to build up their broad educationexpert pilot adept pilot master pilot staff officer levelpilots with a broad knowledge of skills and trades and being able to fly a wide range of ships and operating their modules weaponry and rigs good to very well also specialised pilots to a few distinguished trades with excellent to superb command of all ships and skills to master their professionselder pilot sage pilot omniscient pilot admirality levelpilots with not only a very broad education and being able to fly nearly all ships of all races including operating their modules weaponry and rigs very well to superb but also mastering all industrial trades very well and up to perfectionthe ranks should be automatically assigned to a pilot in a npc corporation after having been assigned the certification and the point value calculated an option for the pilot to switch on and off the rank as being displayed on his character info should be offeredceos of player corporations can simply adapt to this system and thus achieve a guideline on how to create a rank system for their corporation although they obviously do not need to stick to the rank lables at all and can invent their own
nocertificates are uselessjust like certificates this is another useless arbitrary ranking systemit serves no purpose
i have stated that the certificate system is not perfect but it is not that bad and gives acceptable guidelines of what to trainthe rank system gives some more sense and meaning to the certificate system motivates to become proficient in one or more skillsets and miniprofessions and offers goals and acknowledgment for being reasonably well trained for somethingit could be fun for many help some and wont hurt anybody

question first  what is wrong with the survey scanner2nd i might see the point but tend to think that it is a tad too easy  elaborate if you want let me get the point
its a simple thing to not allow for cargo expansion wouldnt it make sense to be able to customize your freighter with better agility or higher warp speed or whatever and not be able to increase your cargo capacity freighters are already optimized for cargo so they simply cant be optimized furtheri think it would be a great improvement of the game for all freighter pilots even when they say they dont support it
not supportedis that a platinuminsured nyx i see in jita  hint courier contractsyes some means of partitioning cargo beyond courier packages and gfcs would be useful for a lot of pilots a giant secure freight container might also be useful one can already expand freighter cargo via courier contracts containing hundreds of loaded gscs but this is extremely tedious
dont you think that as a jump freighter pilot i would already be aware of thati mean isnt just a little bit obvious

no what youbve just agreed to is that your argument is based upon the misapprehension that bonuses and balance can be applied in eve online without taking the shiptoship balance into accountbasically what your doing is saying you want your ships balancing without any actual recourse to the game you want them balancing on shophistic principles are bull smoke and mirror tactics your either a very persistant troll or you genuinly fail to understand the game your playingas an aside admitting to being a sophist if you are aware of the words meaning or context is basically admitting to being a liar and a very poor one at that
not supported ops logic and proposal are flawed
at least he has logic not like you
the blanket approach as you call it is not deserving of mockerythe racial bonus nature of the hull damage mod on cmbs is not equivelent in strength to the hull damage mods recived by gun boatsbeing generous to the conversion and assuming that kin is the optimal ammo for 13rds of encounters means that a 25 kin only bonus  at lvl 5  is equivelent to a 8 rof or dpl bonus  at level 5 of course gun boat hull damage bonuses run at 5 meaning that at lvl 5 a gun boats damage bonus will be 3 times stronger in actual usage than a cmbs bonus if the cmb pilot uses optimal ammoall arguments about rainbow damage bonuses being op went flying out the window with the dominion revision of mini ammodrake and cerb may be close to top of there class if they got proper damage bonuses but would not be opdouble rainbow damage bonused sac is not considered op by the player base  in fact it is one of the least flown ships in eveshort range set ups in use still tend to be ac and blaster boatsand a cerb would still lose out to the ishtar with its massive 10 per level damage to whatever flavour it wants to do damage bonuses  room for neut  nosalso i think your numbers are bs 660dps  80kehp at the same time  since when could damage moded ham drakes fit a tank i know for a fact you have left of any propulsion mods or tackle to get close to that number a problem a passive  resisted ac cane wouldnt have2 weapons systems are based on damage switching  missiles and proj 2 weapons systems are based on range  hybrids and lasers 3 weapon systems get 25 damage bonus  5 per level rofdpl  those being hybridlaserproj  proj being close to rainbow 1 weapon system gets 8 damage bonus  5 kin only equiv of 16 per level rofdpl  that being missileschanging kin only to rofdpl would only bring missile bonuses up to the same level of gunsit is mathematically impossible for the game to be balanced as it iseither cmbs are balanced verus equiv gun boats at pilot lvl 1 or they are balanced at lvl 5 they can not be balanced at both because of the disparity in the stregth of the bonusesdoes a caneruppyrifter pilot lose 25 of his dps when he switches from fusion to emp   exp  em answer no  does he fck  good bonuses that are compatible with tacticsdoes a drakecarakessie pilot lose 25 of his dps when he switches from kin to emanswe yes he does  e bonuses that are not compatible with tactics
you dont have the faintest idea what youre talking about this thread is worse than the contents of my toilet on new years day urgh fyi its 83k ehp and 658 dps with a 3 pg implant or 642 dps withoutblanket boost are lazy and stupid the af afterburner bonus on sisi proved this some ships have issues fix them on a casebycase basis the problem missile boats will not be fixed by giving them multispectral damage and the good missile boats do not need boosting it will not fix the nhs awful pg nor the hookbills terrible cpu nor the sacs poor range and awkward slot layout and the multispectral damage of the raven doesnt alter the silly cpu requirements of shield rr mods

its the bog standard ham drake fit man dont talk about game balance issues until you know how to fit a ship
omg arent you guys bring the drake defense speach up too often it is a good caldari ship i would say one of the very few caldari ships worth using for pvp but bringing it up every time in a caldari topic is a little bit boringso caldari ships should be crap because they have the drakewhy arent you compare the caracal vs like vexor or  wait that would clearly show how flawled the caracal isor hawk vs anything worst ship in eveor the phoenix worst dreador a nighthawk worst combat commandship for pvpor crow worst ceptor and kestrel what i havent flown in ageswait all of those are crap compared to the other races ships in the same type coincidence lets see what is so similar in them  oh wait the kinetic only bonuswhat a shamethe ravenits variants are only good for pve because they dont have the stupid kinetic only bonussame with the rookbut the drake 
firstly by your early posts in this thread we see you dont want the ships your whining about comparing to other ships so talk of tackling is moot as is talk of propsulions mods secondly the racial boost is equal to rof and dps bonuses when the end effect results in balance in the game called eve online now on paper which i would like you to note is not eve online you might be considered right by some people unfortunately were playing eve online so your notwithout using the cerbs kin bonus on the below fit skills lvl5 i end up with 756 dps with t1 nonkinetic ammo and 78114 ehp tank with regen tank of about 255 highs 5x t2 hamsmids 1x invul ii 1x photon scattering field ii 3x lse iilows 3x pds ii 1x bcs iinow i am about to do something that might irritate you im going to compare this with a similar outfit on a muninn close range acs dps with high ehp tank hardener plugging lowest resist and eanm instead of eminvul shield hardener what i get is 904 dps and 49838 ehp with no regen or active tank of any sortwell how oddthe cerb looks like it would winbut wait i forgot you didnt want it comparing to other ships oh silly me
what are you talking about 756dps for a cerb how your whole post makes no sense
ahahaahahahahahahahahahilariousahahahahahahahahahhaoh the drake wont someone please think of the drake
the problems of the ships that you quote are nothing to do with the kinonly bonus you are barking up the wrong tree putting 1  1 together and getting 3caracal needs a bit more pg really but its basically alright solo and in ganghawk  cpu and roflketsphoenix  missile flight time in fleetnighthawk  too little pg btw astarte is worstcrow  roflketskestrel  roflketsfiddling with kineticonly bonuses will do nothing to fix these problems it will not enable the nh to fit a gang mod without multiple fitting mods it will not enable the hawk to get a worthwhile sml fit on or give it the dualweb that its roflkets need nor will it make citadel missiles hit instantly nor does having multispectral damage make the raven viable as a shield rr bs the drake and cerb are topnotch ships even with their kineticonly bonus while the multispectral sacrilege is close to worthless this kineticonly issue is a smokescreen blinding you to the true problemsare you interested in taking the time to analyse and fix broken ships and produce a balanced game or are you just interested in a simplistic nozhstyle blurf change that makes your eft numbers look better but doesnt actually fix these ships problems
oh god yes also 2 lows kinda sucks needs 34 tbh  but thats really the fault of the tier systemdoesnt need a lot  definitely less than 150 gridliang
about fixing crappy ships question is not how but when i dont care realy much how ccp will fix them until they will be balanced oh and different than the rest p
stop talking rubbish do you even know what dps means 
damage per shotsecondsalvo depending upon who your talking toyou asked for a fit that could do what the other guy said i provided one that could then provided another ship similarly fitted but without the nerfed bonus that couldnt beat it in combatfunny thing is i just proved you wrong much like many others in this thread have and you respond with insults pretty standard response from someone who doesnt think things through when whining about how much their ships suck eh

this is a nobrainer if your account is not active then you should not be able to interact with or benefit from eve in any way

you forgot the skill negotiationsalso your 150200 days is a bit much you dont need any but the first three skills to lvl 5 the rest can be at lvl 4 and you will get close enough to the max possible takes about a month on a new accountnone of this is relevant though the question is should research points accumulate when an account is inactive ill go one step further and say research points should be reset to zero and not advance when an account is inactive
i think thats going too far you did after all accumulate the rps with an active account that would be like saying if your acount goes inactive we zero out your isk

i like this it seems like a nice simple solution to getting greater control over your drones although id still like a whole drone ai module where i could write whole programs for thembut realistically this has my support
every shieldbuffered pvper in the game would gladly trade the ludicrously tiny increased recharge from the shield hp ganglinkskills away for the instant addition of the bonus hp every single one and every shield tanking pveer will have a booster fit so they dont actually have a problemif giving up the extra hps recharge is what it takes to convince people here who have obviously never really flown a shieldbuffered ship in pvp  pro tip were not talking about purger drakes people that the bonus hp should be added instantly then thats what the csm should consider submittingabsolutely supported  with or without a proportional recharge penalty this is a simple tweak that fixes a big balance disparitypersistence of all bonuses between sessions would be nicer of course but that sounds significantly more technically complex
thank you everyone for the discussion i will raise this issue for the next csm meeting on the 17th
supportedid also like a ceo option for the corp logo to be displayed alongside the alliance logohowever the player should be able to disable the display of both logos in his client
i also believe that this would be in ccps interrest in terms of getting more players and more player satisfactionone of the things that make my hairs stand is watching awesome eve videos wish evetube came backvideos for recruitment videos to show how awesome our game really is videos that make people feel as part of the eve community
hehe its not whining as i quite like the new visuals it just would be added awesome if the new skins would be glued into locations where they make sense unlike current temperate earthlike skins 60 au from sun like parent stars with surface temperatures low enough to have atmospheric gases in solid forms
op had a perfectly valid point i dont mind our ships breaking elementary laws of physics as much but planets should at least roughly stick to them
supportedthere are planets in the game classed as temperate with surface temperatures of only a few kelvinthats cold enough to make even geordies say its a bit nippy
well maybe it is time for ccp to get a phd and fix planets stats and some items descriptions also maybe it is time to get rid of marines that weigh one ton each i know they would get big muscly guys into the army but their should be a limit anyway it looks absolutely ridiculous when you have 3 first planets ice ones then you have a gas giant and like 2 lava planets and then a temperate world does not make any sense stares at another temperate world with gravity of 5g covered with oceans and with temperature of 77 kelvinsso yes maybe lets get a phd for him to check that all the stuff devs put in actually makes a slightest bit of sense

because half the things in eve have no indication of them happening the game mecanics especially pvp is mostly undocumented and a new player has no way of knowing what is going on unless he tries it once and odds are he will not get it right the first time and die or find out from others

i agree completely

dominion has only been out for a little over a month and look at all these noobs complaining about this new feature
only vets that are in alliances that have failcascaded five times have the experience to speak on such issues
support
one good thing about this new feature is that it is a ready source of drama who doesnt like drama

im a carebear but im mostly in favor of this proposition as applied to unclaimed or npc 00 but not for lowsec it will and should make carebears and ratters working there more paranoid though a proper convoy or mining op shouldnt have too many problems explorers will probably like this since they can remain covert in a siteplex unless someone actively looks for themhowever if this is implemented i would also like to see a multilevel sov upgrade as a reward for upgrading the system heres a basic setup local level 1 would implement current local settings in the system but delayed 5 minutes or so and not configurable local level 2 would also implement it with the delay setable at the infra hub local level 3  but would be dependent on the pilots standing with the sovholding corp only pilots with sufficiently high standing or corpalliance members would see local information in realtime standing would be setable at the infrastructure hub this would make local an intelligence source but only for the home team and their friendscommentary is welcome
1 360 degree max range directional scanner and they know if there are ppl within how much was it again au the ones docked up are invisible then and the ones at a pos were already untargetable so for them nothing changes well itd be less safe to undock esp if your outpost spits you out and some of the clutter is removed from the list the docked onesid say the attacker knows which ships are with him if he isnt solo not in the least as those are the ones showing a range after gatecloak or not at all during the gatecloak so for him nothing changes for the worse he even gets less clutter as the docked ones are gone so half of the useless targets disappearall he has to do is warp to the belts and seek the unfortunate souls that didnt spam the grind often enough even the upgraded systems are not difficult as instead of on rightclick menu the sites appear at the click of a button in a windowas for the ratterminerwhatever even if they spam the grind often enough they have no way of knowing who is there could be blue as well as red the attacker can attack everyone on scan the defender has no way of knowing if he should warp to safety or not and if you have to warp out every time someone enters the system you cannot mine or rat very much
who has more to fear from the menu the customer or the cowyou want a replacement intel source how about good old fashion hard workrisk vs reward and all thatif you want to know that your space is safe then get out there and patrol itdscan combat probes gate guards roving patrols of beltsplanetsmoonsthe only safe place in eve is docked inside a station
maybe a limited form of the map search option that shows people in space in the last 30 minutes could work to replace it remove local but add a directional scan which covers systemwide however all it does is show the amount of people in system and has maybe a 3 minute cycle timethis way you can see spikes in population to prepare for larger scale ops or small boosts for lowsec pirates you wont see name corp etcalso we have sentry drones why not sentry probes short range passive modules you can set to tell when a ship crosses a small sector of space they can blare an alarm when incoming ships warp in to the region the plus is that you can scan sentry probes easily so its both more risk and more reaction if you want local gone you need to give limited pointdefense or pointscanning tools to help
ooh theres an ideasentry would have a limited radius so you have to post it close to where you want to monitor meaning a watched gate is quite obviously a watched gate and if anyone triggers it the response is immediatebut also give them realistic targeting and scanning it has to get a lock and then identify the ship before it can report more so if a covops sneaks through your gate cloaking immediately the sentry cant report anything more than contact at the gate whereas a fleet coming through would report more like selrid miamarr  abaddon  marcus gideon  dominix  chribba  hulk 
i strongly approve of this idea  i would however like to add the idea of being able to split the stacks as formentioned but also being able to have say 2 stacks of 15 and 3 of 11of 5 ect this would allow adjustments for players with inferiour skills minor roles and would enable the orca hualer to not have to keep trac if an even split is not desired
bumpespecially with motherships now getting a hp boost this is going to be a glaring issue with motherships now as wellreally all capitals
what if the bounty just logs off for an entire week
more relevantly what happens if the bounty accepts the contract with an alt and then kills himself in a shuttle its not a bad plan but its not nearly complete enough to be taken forward step back think through all the problemsmaybe with some friendsrandom forumers helping and then take it up again
the payout would be the default insurance value of the ship destroyed to avoid this possible exploit this is deducted from the payout if any received by the destroyed targetthis financial approach will prompt bounties to avoid being hunted down and shot for any reason even if its in nothing more than a shuttlethis continues until the entire bounty has been acquiredto avoid exploitive use of altpodding a useless clone the maximum payout for a pod kill is the value of updating the clone deducted from the bounty not the pilot
now this is what i meant by random forumers making it a more complete proposal this makes the proposal work far better and even if there are holeshacs should pay out more than 3 mil it still makes this thread dramatically better
yes that is in fact a good improvement i want to initiate something that true bounty hunting will become possible in this universe and if others contribute to a system which allows such even the betterill add this payout scheme as proposed by mister xerox to my proposal
this would stop the pirate to kill other innocents for a whole week but i would not object to skip this requirement or to lengthen the amount of time mentioned
as there is already a bounty office why not allow players to go and pick up the contract from the bounty office much like a normal bounty hunter would do this way the target wouldnt know whether a contract has been taken out on him or who has taken that contractit would also allow a multiple people to hunt the same target leading to competition within the profession the first one to get the pod kill and deliver the corpse to the nearest bounty office completes said contractthe contract would also act as a way to stop concord intervening providing you are attacking the target on the contract remote reps and others would still be subject to normal flagging mechanicson completion of the contract all other bounty hunters that have taken a contract on that target are informed by eve mail to say the contract has been fulfilled to prevent them wasting time
so the bounty hunter would get 40 baseprice per ship killed until the entire bountys collectedto collect a 10 mil bounty on someone who flies only frigates for the duration of the bounty id need to get around 100 killsif there are 5 contracts out on a target could i accept all 5 would i get 200 baseprice per killas target could i keep an alt around to shoot at me once the hunter comes and have it take part of the bounty
with your permission i would like to raise this issue in the next csm meeting on the 17thhowever it will have to be a relatively unspecific proposal along the lines of may ccp in all its wisdom introduce drone implants and rigs yn with the caveat that its impossible for us to decide on specific attributes and slots without spending a gazillion hours discussing it thus leaving much for ccp to decide

shamelessbump
evelopedia ate the article for some reason but major changes to the watch list system were proposed by me and voted in so its passed on to ccp as a list of improvements no need to raise this again 
remove all the module effects except rr use dev resources to fix broken 00
signedyes please  no effect or a much subtle one is welcome in large gangs it has a negative effect on performance aswell as being anoying to hell and back 
we have a rig that gives 10 to powergrid lets have a rig that boosts cpu should we their are alot of ships that lack cpu mainly the small ships your opinionsps ovcource we could place some very powerfull drawback if we need one one of them could be cutting power grid
i know we discussed this a bit ingame but ill say my piece here too i dont like it itd be hard to balance and itd cut off a huge number of other cool rigs that you could build insteadsay the cpu use for guns rigs if they ever made them useful id rather that we make the more specific cpu rigs useful instead of trying to make new generic ones not a terrible idea but i cant support it
simply put remove any ability to set any standings at all everyone is simply either blue in your alliance green in your corp or neutral bye bye to the 1000 vs 1000 in one system garbage ultrablob warfare small alliances will actually have a chance to get into 00 without being forced to nap either team a or team broaming in small gangs is viable again amongst other things that are deeply missed in the old days of eveso before you rage flame this idea just take a couple minutes to think about how the dynamics of 00  low sec  empire would be like and if it would be better or worse than what we are experiencing nowside notewhat would 00 be like during the first weekafter a month6 monthsps  faction warfare well not sure about how that would fit in but it would not get any worse for sure
who would be able to stop bob thend
as i understand it everyone is neutral to begin with and it is up to you to manipulate the standings when you go to war they become red when they become allies they become blue whether you adjust the neutrals to either side is up to youonce treaties are released which got nudged out of dominion i think the more complicated bits of standings with alliances should be eased at least in part
this is a fundamentally dumb plan and it will continue to be fundamentally dumb no matter how many people propose it you cant stop people from having friends just by making the ui even less functional than it already is youll just make people memorize corp tickers and maybe push alliances to merge you wont change gameplay youll just annoy the crap out of everyone no
didnt you and your boys laugh at my exact same proposal about 3 months agoyou are obviously so narrow sighted as to not realize how good what you just said is for destroying super blobsmemorizing corp tickers works o so well currently when something odd happens and standings arent set or bugged oh wait thats right people usually shoot first and then realize mistakesmerging alliances together wouldnt at all create political strife oh wait it would because the power hungry want power the reason for so many smaller grouping of alliances is because it seperates ideals into finer details under similar types of leadership grouping those people together would create problems ultimately leading to breakoffs of that alliance that would ultimately create the same separation we see today which leads back to standings  upsultimately this leads to people refusing to blue so many ing people and instead put bullets in each others heads because its just way easierback in the good old days before standings nobody like being allied outside of an alliance because it created constant standings issues many people choose either to stay away or just form under one flag as a result this lead to the wonderful leadership councils of fa and stain and ascn that worked out oh soo well just ask those old players how much they loved 5 hr meetings of 50 corp heads trying to all  about how much a pound really weighs
i think you misunderstood what i was getting at i should probably revise my op a bit if you did make a similar proposal link it maybe its better than minebottom line is ccp can only do so much with hardware to free up lag and such something else has got to give would this idea really be game breaking memorizing tickers be realistic guys something has got to change to get rid of this team a vs team b only senario eve would only get vastly more enjoyable if this happened you cant stop people from becoming friends forming a gang is niceall in all it comes down to either you are on the overview or you are not time to spice it up
hey im not an idiot i know this will make stuff harder to run  probably not as much harder as youre suggesting since id like to think that people can learn from the mistakes of their predecessors but harder to put it bluntly though what effect it will have is secondary to me eves user interface is frigging awful and youre proposing to make it even worse am i the only one who thinks thats insane youre trying to social engineer fifty thousand people by means of making this game even harder to play you keep doing stuff like this and youll succeed at making blobs smaller because people will quit playing instead of taking the  youre trying to shovel onto them youve commanded big blobs before  what would your opinion have been if ccps solution to big blobs was to eliminate the ability to warp between gang members or to run gang warps i hear thatd make big fleet movement next to impossible  thatd mean smaller blobs right or how about it checks your computer to see if you have a voice chat program running and logs you out of eve if you do what youre proposing is less invasive but no less terrible an idea you are trying to make the game harder to play for the specific purpose of forcing people not to play the way that they want what sort of bizarro world game design philosophy is that
i guess you guys are referring to stuff that i was not all to familiar with from years ago that were issues resulting from there being no standings feature in the game granted some of these issues could apply now but the game has changed dramatically since thenif removing standings would create more problems then how about using the same model of war dec fees and introduce them to standings the more alliancescorps you blue with the more expensive it becomes of course there would be that whole only shoot red people but maybe that aspect of standings could be changedfixing the lag will not fix the current problem of ultrapower blocks in 00 nap train a vs nap train b is just dumb it does not allow any other alliances to enter 00 without joining either side ccp and the csm acknowledged that and dominion was supposed to fix that from what is happening nothing has changed
i highly doubt removing the standing list would solve it it would just put more work on the diplomats of the big blocks they still would bring the same numbersthe chance was that the new sov system would lower this a bit but i think allow to anchor the tcu next to a deathstar pos isnt really helping the causemaybe we should disallow this
why not change the game so that anyone not in your corpalliance gets automatically targetted and the guns start to fire unless you manually stop them by entering a random 20 digit codethat would prevent any napfest pretty good noi know i dont know that many multiplayer games but i think eve must be the only one where it is declared to be a problem if people are not constantly hostile to each other
lawl no
for some reason and i have yet to figure out why this is one of those ideas that instead of being refined and made better every time it gets posted actually gets worse its like a really crappy wine that only get nastier the longer it sits in the barreleven if you completely removed standings from the game players would still use them theyd just find another way to manage them most likely some out of game website some intrepid pilot would throw together then instead of checking for a colored icon in game theyd have to toss a name into a search screen and get a killno kill order this doesnt strike you as making the game less enjoyablealso despite your apparent this only applies to nullsec people anyway approach people in high sec do use standings as welli can appreciate your frustration about the lag in nullsec but this isnt the way to fix it im not even sure it would help the way you think it would i have a feeling it would make the blobs bigger since people would want to make sure theyre surrounded by people they can if not trust then at least feel comfortable they wont accidentally shoot them in the midst of a fight
as its already been pointed out removing standings is a waste of time as it would result in more frustrating forms of communication and relationsjust because someone is blue to me doesnt mean they cant shoot me or i cant shoot themeven then your likely going to get a ton of complaints and various whines over it so this is a big fat troll imho
sighi guess no one likes the idea of a 00 without nap trains and laggy fleet fights this particular stab at trying to fix that may not be a good idea but i dont see anyone else proposing anything besides its all ccps fault csm you need to intervene somehow emo threads
how many blues does tri have
it has nothing to do with whether i like or dislike it any more than my opinion regarding a dictatorship of the proletariat does you cant get there from here stop trying spend your effort on something that can work  solutions like node reinforcement general server code improvements and placing a high priority on fixing bugs like the one leading to the recent lag those will do much more for fleet fights than any sort of harebrained scheme to balance the game by cranking up player annoyance itll work about as well as the attempts to balance pos sovereignty the same way  you wont stop the behaviour youll just make your most dedicated players despise you
supportedi too dont have a clue why some gellente ships have splitted weapon systems in turretsmissilesbesides eris see lachesis too
hmm i guess i see your points good thing i dont make games
random ideas should be in the suggestions forumproperly drafted proposals and issues should be in the assemble forum
not supportedthe reasons for empire dwelling go so far beyond simply making easy isk isk is a means to allowing players to get what they want remove the ability to make isk and you remove the ability for them to get what they want that might be a t2 marauder a pvp cruiser or skills that will see them improve their capabilities at this point they might as well not play because eve is changing from a sandbox where you can do anything to forcing players to go where the minority want them to goif you want people in your space make it more desireable to operate in that means making it safe from pirates and profitable at least ccp can increase the spawns and rewards but at the end of they day they only control the basic mechanics its the players the make the environment and if that environment is not attractive to people then that is the problem of players attitude and thus only players can solve it
want more people in lo sec stop shooting them to extinction there stop asking ccp for overpowered toys infinipoint ships stop asking ccp to nerf carebear toys to uselessness wcs start doing your part in getting more people in there ask your corp to protect your local systems from pirates instead of scaring the guests awayno i didnt think so carry on with your nerf crusade
hictors are not overpowered  theyre like hacs that deal half the damage and wcs are not useless  on a hauler their only drawback is that they take up a low slot yeah theyre useless on a combat ship but thats as it should be i mean ops idea is offbase i think im not disagreeing with your opposition of it but please use some arguments that make at least a little bit of sense
then why not come up with a plan to stop the scammers and hackers instead of ruining it for the legitimate 99
dont forget that we find ourselves in a very privileged position being able to trade characters and real money for ingame valuta i am sure that im not the first to say that without these two mechanisms eve would be a different and possibly better game
you know if you disagree with the proposed change you shouldnt support it even more so if you propose a different one
its nice to see theres someone on the csm whos likeminded
no im sure youre not the first to say it doesnt change the fact that i completely disagree or the fact that ccp disagrees as well
you only disagree with the last two words of my statement theni always have and always be against the sillyness that is gtcisk and in that same way iskchars is exactly the same namely buying your way into a game so that skill doesnt matter any moreim proud to say im a self made man i own a titan a mothership and four characters three trained up from scratch and i did all that without spending a single euro on anything other than subscription and a fanfest trip and there are many people who are many times richer than i am because they are smarter or can spend more time so the mechanisms arent needed by any means people do fine without them
amendments can be made before its brought up its not like ccp or the csm make any decisions based off the exact wording of a request in a forum thread
well yeah i only disagree with the last two words but thats the core of your statement usdor eur if thats your thing  isk trade is brilliant  if it wasnt for the inevitability of abusemacroing exploits etc id favour allowing unfettered twoway trade id love to see a proper forex market in fictional currencies itd make my inner economist very happy and yes people can do without them ive never bought iskthough i do sell it i fund two accounts through plex nor have i ever traded characters most of the ultrarich players i know are in the same boat with the exception of maybe the odd sale of an extraneous industry alt but for people with more money than time its great they can get what they need to play and outsource the grinding to some cultural studies major with more time than money its winwin and instead of providing an incentive to macro it cuts the knees out from under people who want to make a rl living by being an eve miner
i support this suggestion
 op  you are not very good at eve actually youre very bad at eve i suggest you reconsider your subscription being warp scrambled for 10 minutes and not noticing it on your overview doesnt mean that you should get a popup with a dismissal ok but
i really dont see the point of this i dont need a rating system based on the alreadybad certificate system i can just look at the api data of anyone i need a read on the skills of
attitude and experience beat any other arbitrary ranking system
the one thing this game does not need is another way for asshats to stroke their epeenno
we dont need a rank system when we have killmails causing epeenismsditch killmails and ill support itotherwise sorrycerts are craptastic as it is when they miss various fields of professions like freighter pilots
sorry but this is a terrible ideacertificates are useless and are taking up database space that would be far better used elsewhere this will do the same
well looks like it is not liked by the audience here that pilots will be able to show off anything else but killmails to demonstrate any ingame achievementwe all know that this game lives from those who create isk and mine roids they dont have killmails except as showing up as victims killmail creators dont create any worth in game they only destroy it what on the other side is as well crucial but why those more civilian aligned pilots must be denied any official recognition of what they are doing good is beyond me i know and understand and have it written already twice here that certificates are not perfect right now they are outright meaningless for most with a system as proposed there will be more than a few pilots being motivated to pursue certificates and in effect will even profite from generally better skillsetswhen certificates get more impact value and meaning in the game they even might be improved into something truly useful
plenty of people are recognized for things that dont involve killmails tripoli entity chribba haargoth agamar ricdic  could you even describe vaguely a kill involving any of them because i cant theres plenty of things to brag about  just because theres no explicit ingame mechanism to aid you in doing soexcept the api the forums screenshots doesnt mean that it cant be done or that you cant get famous for it

i would prefer they do away with npcs altogether in plexes plexes should be defended by the militia players just let players know what plexes are being taken so they can do the work themselves
i intend to join the faction wars sometime this year and this issue should be solved by then
the real issue is minidding aka how ccp took away the titans aoe 71k smartbomb and put 56k of it into 7 stealth bombers however it takes a lot more effort and coordination to do a good bombing run than just hitting a button and killing everything on grid with predominion titans when a bombing run works its so rewarding to the whole group because it does take a lot of preparation and skill so lets keep this feature however keeping it mostly means keeping it balanced otherwise people will start whining about it and sbs will get nerfed to hell and maybe lose this nice rolefirst of allfix the issue of bombs not traveling 30km off after launched when its laggy which results to dieing to your own bomb this is a critical issuethen the followingreduce bombs aoe down to 10kmreduce bombs velocity down to 1kmsecincrease bombs travel time to 30secincrease bombs explosion radius up to 650m the idea is to make bombs slower and less powerful unless the target is paintedalso consider removing their ability to fit covops cloak when if the local window gets removed alsonot by any chance do i consider these halfmeasures against minidds remember given the current bombs hardened  in armor perfect bombings can do up to 56k racial damage per wave which is a stunning amount of alpha damage even against battleship hulls by making these changes you give a chance to the opposing side to counter either by warping out or using smartbombs in a 56sec window or having a small signature these changes will make bomb runs more difficult as bombs will have to land near the target and successive waves usually will be needed to take down battleships thus making the game more balanced while preserving the fun role stealth bombers have nowi hope ive made a compelling argument
1 the lag issue is more general and doesnt need special fixing imho2 bombs are fine spread out and stop blobbing bombs are the perfect counter to big blobs of ships sitting close making rr close range blobs much more vulnerable which is good3 smart bombs already work vs bombers though again sitting in a big pile makes them hard to use
smartbombs work if you can nail that 12sec window you get with current bomb velocity and smartbomb radius which is pretty impossible to manage and coordinate making bombs slower opens that window up to 56sec which actually makes it possible to actually time it and smartbomb the incoming bomb bombs are almost fine their 15km aoe radius makes bombing a gate the closest thing there is to predominion titan dding which is completely unbalanced that radius needs to go down to 10km spreading out as you suggested doesnt help because of that radius what you dont understand is that a smaller aoe radius makes bombs more deadly as the amount of overlapping 10km spheres decreases thus decreasing the chances of losing a bomb to its own wave thus increasing the amount of bombers that can simultaneously drop a bombits not about the enemy spreading out its about you the bomber gang spreading your bombs which actually requires manual flying and true skill
bombs and bombers are just fine imo they are a very necessary counter to rr bs as you unintentionally point out in your post their great power is balanced by requiring great player skill and by their extreme vulnerabilitya 56k alpha should be easily resisted by any pvp bsmore t2 ships should be like bombers tbhnot supported
3 waves of sharpnel can be resisted by your vanilla flavored explosive hardened rr tempest maybe 4 if conditionsboni are idealyou miss the point though the point is to create a window of opportunity to escape a bombing run or at least counter it im not talking about the overall potential damage output of a bombing run that still remains the same 56k very few bs can fit a smartbomb and a lrar without gimping their dps claiming now that smartbombs are a viable tactic against a bombing run is clearly wrong rr bs need to be at most 8400m apart otherwise rring doesnt work and can have a 6k t2 smartbomb range both modules are really restricting on their own not to mention smartbombing each otherall those figures i posted in the op need to be set to make this whole deal balanced bombs need to be at least 10km off the rr bss which still gives them a 4km opening where smartbombs wont save the rr bssand consider again this bombing a gate when whatever fleet just jumped is 100 equal to a predominion dd appearing 12km off the gate after the jump places you within the aoe radius of the bomb thus killing you before you even actually manage to hit your dcu and hardeners if you dont see a clear imbalance in this 100 true scenario i dont know what else could convince you
rr bs dont fit smartbombs
so you do understand youre supporting my argument by saying that rr bs dont fit smartbombs which actually strikes them out as a viable bomb countering tactic rightdid you actually read what i said about bombing a gate that has cloaked by the gate ships that just jumped in or did you just decide to address to this issue only on the points you think youre right and forgetting all the rest
not supportingi fly them dont see any of the problems that where outlinedand honestly this feels like its a nitpicker and not a buffmore of a nerfespecially if you remove covert ops seriously do you even fly them
bombers are the counter to rr bs not the other way around theyre overpowered against unsupported rr blobs because thats what bombs are designed to doi didnt answer your point about bombing gates to get inbound jumpers ive never seen the tactic used but i dont see anything wrong with it given the maths a 5km size gate and i think theyre bigger than that has a spherical jumpin area of 2642km2 a bomb will have a maximum intersection of 706km2 actually more depending on the angle of the chordyou also get 10 seconds to see the bomb and gtfo which is generally enough for any ship small enough to be oneshotted by the bomb remember that small ships take a large reduction in damage due to sig radiusedit and really a gate is only one of several ways to get into a systemedit 2 anyone who knows my alliance knows that we do a lot of rr bs work weve done some work analyzing bomber attacks and concluded that theyre a threat but not by any means an unbeatable one the tools are already in the game we view bombers as another factor on the battlefield which we can overcome by improving our fleet doctrine i might add that nerfing stealth bombers would be a net benefit for us since were bombed far more than we bomb but its not a nerf that any of us believe is needed in short i know what im talking about
bombers are fine and your proposed changes range from unnecessaryexplosion radius to awfulremoving the covops cloak not supported
overall premiseallow a system for players to consensual pvp solo or in group players can pick and choose fights by entering a cue ship and isk loss is part of the action the reward for participants is the ability to choose fights in highsec this can be a hot issue the simple argument is that if you want pvp go find it in 00 or lowsc join a pvp corp or challenge someone in local in highsecwhy an arena an arena implantation can allow players to learn pvp which benefits fleets gangs and pvp corps causal players can find casual pvp vs the time it takes to organize a fleet roaming gang or other wiseanother advantage is helping the market  more ship losses means more sales and increased need for supply this affects the economic chain implementationcreate a noninstanced solarsystem that allows for consensual pvp use the alliance tournament rule set with some modification all participants can expect that if they loose they loose their ship allow players to be able to warp within the system but not jump out jumping would cause the loss of the ship and the forfeiture of any match do not allow for the creation of bookmarks in the system players can warp but only to existing destinations the system security should be set to 5 this allows players with marginal standings to enter the system and participate the systems should be located away from major hubs and even located in the midst lowsec adding travel to the risk this can stimulate traffic into lowsec putting it togethera player enters the pvp arena system he docks at station he sets himself up in a cue the cues can vary  solo fights vs group fights limitations can be placed on ship types cruiser vs cruiser for example or limited player numbers maybe a range players in a fight so you can have lopsided groupingsplayers pay an isk fee to participate on a match the larger the ship type the larger the fee the fee is not refundable and lost winners do not gain the fee back player gets awarded a sigil for pvp once a match is established with another players player leaves the station and warps to a spawned arena pvp beacon the sigil in the player cargo has several affectsit allows the play to fly to the designated pvp beacon  locationit prevents them from being concorded when engaging the selected opponentplayers cannot join or invite other players to gang if the player is already in a gang with other members not without a sigil for the set fight the player with the sigil is removed from the gang the spawned pvp beacon is visible to all players in the system betting and viewingother players should be allowed to observe and bet on matches betting pools can be done at stations observers can warp to a beacon and watch the action players with bets on a particular match should have the option to warp to the combatants in the system with a limited distance players can only bet against other players not an npc entity so betting requires other participantsexisting system destinationsstationsasteroid fields low yieldarena pvp beacons arena pvp complex and bunkers players use the system to pvp and learn to pvp in different environs players attempting to interfere aggressing shooting or even targeting combatants should be concorded this includes nonparticipants using remote rep
gain and losswith all things eve there should be a gain and a loss gainwinning a fight by destroying the other players ships players should be rewarded with a small percentage of isk based on the total amount of winning bets if their where no bets the play does not get any iskwinning players would get a killmail the kill mail will include an indication that the opposing ship was destroyed in an arena system players betting on matches gain what ever the betting pool allocates lossparticipating players that loose loose their ship participants should take a standings hit for pvping in an arena system match the standing hit should be small but overtime should have a cumulative affect this is a consequence as being part of a less then desirable activity as viewed by the more lawful large empires poddingparticipants should be allowed to pod podding another player should carry the same standings penalty awarded to players who pod others in high and low sec bottom lineappeal to casual playerswould help stimulate the economywould allow players to test ship types and gang strategieswill encourage pvp not detract the more experienced a player is at pvp the more likely they will fly out to low and null sec encourages player interaction  through betting and direct competitionpotential for establishing new professions  professional gladiators bookees etc allows players to utilize realistic pvp mechanics  will need to equip warp scrams and webifiers fro example arguments againstmy guess is that fw was established as the compromise to an arena pvp system fw provides goals and allows player to have direct interaction with other players my guess is that the devs rejected an arena system with the following in mindit goes against the sandbox premise of eveit has the potential to detract from pvp in low and null secit would require the creation of different game mechanics within a systemthe servers might have more stress if s system is flooded with pvpers in an arena though given the size of fleet fights or the number of people in jita this seems less relevant players will become dependant on pvp in an arena and not venture into low and null sec there is a desire and need in eve for some for this kind of system with all things gaming players always move on and never remain static in a system ok maybe not everyone players that feel more confident in their pvp skills and have a better understanding of ship loss or the experience of loosing your ship are better equipped to experience different aspects of the eve universe plus this would be fun
i have no objection to this system but im not sure what it does that cant be done with existing tools this sounds exactly like several playerrun tournaments that already exist successfully how much coder time would this take and what would we get for it i expect youll do better just building support tools that can be used for more than just arenas and letting players admin this sort of thing themselves
client run  player runhaving to depend on players to a run a tournament and b implement detracts from the purpose having the client run the system allows for it to be available on demand
1400 people in jita makes for a very unpleasant experience the entry gates closing because of congestion the station exits clogged with ships the lag oh the lag00 pirates curled up under the sheets in fear of the dreaded cloaker who lurks in the shadows hes staring at you from the local roster he could be tucked away in a deep safe his player actually gone downtown while their pc stays logged in but he could also be right behind youyou come home from a long day at the office all you want to do is log in and kill someone but theres 50000 players online and you have to wait in a queue oh the agony of waitingnow how would you define playing a game is a market alt sitting in a station checking prices on various items playing is a market alt sitting in a station completely unresponsive to anyone or anything playing is a covert spy floating 100km from the enemy pos relaying info to corpalliance chat playing is a covert spy slowly coasting towards the surface of the sun completely unresponsive to anyone or anything playingso heres my ideaso long as a player is actively engaged with their client they are playing if you have gone an hour or more without changing course activating a module speaking in chat or searching the marketcontracts you are afkwhen you have been afk for an hour you are logged out to the character selection screen there is nothing in the game that requires your presence without your interaction researchindustry goes on whether you are logged in or not and spying on something still requires regular updatesif a player has turned their machine on only to have a menacing face in local while they are at the office all day they do not need to be taking up space on the serversure this could be countered by a bot but ccp has already said that bots are illegalif an afk timer were introduced it would help to free up server resources as well as help appease the fears and paranoia of null secers everywherethat face in local the one that chased you under the skirts of your pos shield has been staring at you for an hour and then its gone did he leave the system did he logoffski or was he afk the whole time
a freighter on autopilot makes about one jump every five minutes theres highsec routes 4050 jumps long thats four hours of noninteractive play and ill be very annoyed if i have to make some meaningless action every hour to stay logged in similarly theres plenty of times where ill stay logged in solely to get chatlogs from channels i sit in while im out of my house whats wrong with that those are just two forms of afk gameplay your plan would ruin im sure that there are others not supportededit posted this and then saw your sig was please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi lold
1 since when is 4050 jumps on ap a smart idea maybe you havent seen the collections of freight cans floating near gates in case you didnt know the only way for those to float free is to kill the freighter carrying them2 reading chat logs seriously wtf is that eve soap operas on tivotwo forms of afk gameplay when you said yourself you are not playing the game
queue on login dont log out in crowded placesjita is full go to another trade hub theres more than just jitathat menacing face in local tough thats the 00 mind games you agreed to when you moved therethat guy whos not answering maybe hes just ignoring you and talking to his friends in another channel
crowded places try in a wh still had a queue when there were 50k onlinemy thoughts exactly and yet jita is still packed constantlydoesnt stop null secers from whining about how overpowered cloaks areif hes talking to someone then hes not afk is he
in other words hes not playing the game the way you think he should be sorry your atitude reveals volumes about your motivationthat aside a quick google search revealed a circuit that for about 40 in spare parts can be plugged into a keyboard port and send keystrokes to the active window so now the computer is playing eve without me ono waitthats badmy point is that unless you put in something horribly intrusive youre never going to catch afk folks that are determined to be afk and in game at the same time
1 4050 ap jumps is not playing its asking to get ganked if nothing else an afk timer would serve to save a foolish freighter pilot from themselves2 recording chat logs for future reading not even sure what thats abouteveryone is welcome to play the game how they want to play it but not playing is not playingother mmos have afk timers and they log you out after 10min of inactivity i understand eve is much slower paced and its quite possible to go an hour with nothing to do but you should at least check on your character in that hour otherwise you come back expecting to have completed a 4050 jump trip and instead find wreckage and a floating podyes you could wire something up or you could use one of the same bot programs farmers use to turn lasers on and off with proper timing however automation is illegalso because it is possible to work around activity detection does not mean that every single eve player will use those means to cheat and if someone is suspected of using a bot to avoid going afk they can be reported then when ccp messages them to see if theyre awake and they get no response they can ban them
not supported someone correct me if im wrong here but i think the login servers are a separate set of servers that only process logins meaning a login queue is a result of a lot of loginlogout activity and has nothing to do with people already logged into the game
well thats his problem isnt it and btw noon ganks an empty freighter for the hell of it probably if he is autopiloting he knows his stuff isnt worth ganking in general i can see where you are coming from but its a bad idea it just isnt gonna work
well yeah im aware of the possibility of suicide ganks any gankworthy load i manual but if i have a load of trit worth a couple hundred mil or im coming back home empty after dropping off a load why shouldnt i autopilot hell thats half the fun of highsec not having to do that crap yourself hey if your channels have boring discussions thats your problem i sit in some pretty amusing ones not per se but theyre things i need to be logged into eve to do as such they seem close enough to count for the purposes of this debate
not supportedthe login queue comes from people trying to login in larger numbers it has nothing to do with people actually playingand having fun defining afk i could have the client on my 2nd screen while working on the first screen just so i can chat with people when they come online so i am perfectly active just not so much in eve given one of my university projects was programming an event recorderplayer i know how easy it is to fake key strokes and mouse movementso you wouldnt gain much but instead really increase the load
okay now that i have everyones attention here goes i suggest that ccp reduce meta 1 loot drops from rats by 10 per quarter it will give us an idea of how much the market is in fact affected by reprocessed mission loot and not mineral compression mixed in with the current numbers this would do two things be a way to mine data on reprocessing and to see in just how many ways the market would be impacted by such a measure what i would also like to see is more interactivity within eves economy so much in eve is player produced yet all of the meta 24 items have little player input  shoot something oh i gotz a shiney now i would therefore like to propose the introduction of damaged loot dropped by npcs in the same quantities as now of meta 24 items basically have a damaged module drop which is 1m3 in size that has the same name as the actual module for example upon looting i find a damaged ntype explosive hardener it would have the same randomness of dropping as the current module does just now its in damaged form when put into a production slot with the normal materials of a t1 explosive hardener plus blueprint etc you get an ntype explosive hardener and for simplicities sake you can use the same icon only with a red corner to denote it being the damaged version or another thread i saw somewhere else someone mentioned using them in a more noob friendly version of invention or they can be used in a t3 like reverse engineering process please help with furthering this idea into something simple and yet giving more player input into the gameplease dont turn this thread into a remove all t1 loot or you dont get my vote because we dont know what that would do to the eve economy and oh yes my main source of isk is running lvl 4s and i can get easily between 10k and 20k m3 of rat poop in a day to put that in perspective in about a month i have all the minerals i need to make an unresearched thanatos with unresearched component bpos and the kicker i use no ammo orge iis and pulses ftw
please learn the difference between meta 0 and meta 1 loot before posting this kind of idea1 players can build only meta 0 not meta 1 so there is no meta 1 items used for compression i suppose you mean meta 0 in your post2 meta 14 items recycle for less minerals than meta 0you idea beside the use of more minerals to build the named meta 14 modules and that can be a positive characteristic depend on your point of view has a flaw it will use a lot of build slots seeing how it is not possible to rent a manufacturing slot on a pos and that the pos manufacturing capabilities are open only to the owning corp it mean we will suffer from a shortage of building slotsthe net effect would be a overabundance of unused named item components and a sharp drop in non monetary mission rewards and at the same time we will find in market only the top named modules probably at an increased price essentially a new player unfriendly situation no public production slots available without long queues high cost of named modules
even im sick of beating this poor dead horse by nowyes op youre right in my opinion but seriously the case has been made ccp know theyre aware of the issue its not a secret theres nothing new to say

i never said that they didnt try i said that they got pulverized when they did tet was exactly what i had in mind when i said that the standard way to set up a foothold is to drop a pos tower or five this still works it can be done by one guy and they dont even get notified when you do it so unless someone catches you in local you can set up before they have a chance to muster their forces and kick you out if you want guerilla warfare start acting like a guerilla  why are you dealing with a reinforcement timer at all fight them where they dont expect you instead of at a known time and place
a passive omnidirectional scanner with range depending on the ship signature radius as part of overview this doesnt really fill the same niche as local and seems more like a variant on the directional scanner crammed into the overviewwhile i would not mind a directional scanner improvements such as you propose adding tickers and a passive mode that updates it without needing to spam the button  heck go crazy and allow specifying ranges in aus i dont think this is the kind of new intel source that would replace the role of localnpc provided intel like gate feeds is an alternative idea ive been toying with
im all for this perfect intelligence like that provided by an allseeing local window is lamei think the primary objection to this has been that ccp has indicated it would cause immense database strain my point of view as a software engineer is that we as players dont know how ccp designed the system so players cant object on this basis  only ccp cananother objection will come from the nrds community of which i am a part but i dont share the objection in that an iff is great if youre nbsi because anybody that is not friendly is enemy but if youre nrds then there isnt enough information there to determine if the contact is friend or foe certainly this is true but i think getting rid of local is worth the hassleone point id like to suggest is that id like this to work similarly to how probes work meaning that the value used to determine what a contact is would be derived from the signature radius divided by the sensor strength a friendly contact would be known immediately but youd only know the approximate size of a nonfriendly contact until it was near enough that the strength of the contacts signal is high enough the amount of information about the contact should scale higher as it gets closer this is sort of a stealth buff to small ships and anybody who knows me can tell you im a fan of small shipsedit i should note that something like this has been suggested before but im not sure exactly where that suggestion is
yes god forbid you get to see who is at war with your friends

over the last few months i have filed a total of 7 petitions only 3 of which have been answeredthere is the socalled 24 hours email support which isnt after almost two weeks a reply is yet to be received further more the petition function while in theory is a good idea fails to work important issues such as account billing and other issues such as character transfers have yet to be replied tothis is just my experience but from talking to others in game customer support in general is appalingi understand that there is a limited number of staff and that it does take time to investigate issues however receieving no reply is not acceptablei was thinking there may be a channel set and moderated by staff to raise important issues that need immediate attentionwhile this is a game we are paying customers and deserve the customer support deserved as consumers this may be a game but ccp is still a company who wishes to earn money customer support for this game is less than satifactory and is an important issue which needs addressing
there was already a topic of this nature brought up by csm3 that ccp is now looking into supporting it on its merits but it doesnt need to be raised again

there is a general dislike of the current updated eccm effect it is not visually appealing it has issues with its pointsource like appearance see the eccm effect on an apocalypse it it wayy more visually intrusive than all the other local area effects sensor booster tracking computer ectproposalmake the eccm effect similar to the old sensor booster effect an expanding a fading ring that slowly pulses make it smaller than the older sb effect and maybe a little less bright i believe this is will significantly more visually appealing and will also look much more refined
i do not know about you but i find if i am quiclky looking for items to buy on the market i tend to open lots of tabs later i like to tidy them so it is back to being nice and tidy but this can get annoyingthe reason i still do it is that i find the annoyance of seemingly endless scrolling greater than that of collapsing the tabsto sort this i propose that we have a button to automaticaly collapse them all at once saving both time and energywhat do you think
which tabs are you referring to
if i understand the op he means the drop downs for the market categories on the left side you know you click ammunition then projectile then large then artillery etca collapse all feature might be nice but its not important
yes ty i do meant the drop down tabs that you mentionedalso i agree it is not a major thing but in reality it should take hardly any time to impliment

i generally support this but not necesarily with rigs using some kind of installable subsystem would seem to be a better way to go about it it would also allow for more possibilities in customization a freighter with no subsystem installed would work as current freightersorcas imo dont really need to be changed travelfit theyre about as quick as a battleship a subsystem to expand the orcas or rorquals corp hangar or ship maintenance array would be nice to have but isnt essential

i agree with high dps short range in theroy but a large neut am having a 4500 opt if i recall os abit rediculas considering its a bs class weapon i think a minor buff on optimal would seriously help but dropping laser range would help as a balance in addition if they want to look at ammo as a balance increase the opt percentage on null from 80 to maybe 120 i still support weapon changes in general though
supported ive always heard that blasters are supposed to be the ultimate shortrange weapon but when other weapon systems do nearly as much dps at significantly longer range and when blasters cant track very well at their optimal they are not doing their job id prefer a major buff to blaster tracking and a minor increase to dps relative to the other turret systems which might just mean a nerf of lasersacsgallente boats have enough troubles getting into blaster rangeits ridiculous when their supposed dps advantage turns out to be minor on paper and nonexistent in practice
for all the number crunching and trolling the naysayers have done they still havent managed to answer the most simple questionwhy should caldari and only caldari be the only race unable to use their racial weapon system to its full potentialif a caldari ship that gets a damage bonus chooses to use any missile type other than kinetic it gets absolutely no more damage than say a minmatar ship with secondary missile slots like the hurricane how does this make them missile specialistsnerf the drake if youre so obsessed with retaining balance but one of the big advantages of missiles is being able to choose your damage type and caldari are being cheated out of it its as if amarr and only amarr didnt get to switch laser crystals instantly and had a normal reload time insteadand need i point out the stupidity that is the leviathan ccp gave titans a massive weapon damage bonus in dominion to encourage their use as actual combat ships rather than ddd delivery systems but any leviathan pilot who even considers loading thermal em or explosive citadels would have his titan taken away from him on the spot on charges of gross idiocy
they havent came up with even one reason why not fix the kinetic only bonus  drakeing is not reasoning
why should the caldari ships get a rainbow bonus when the boni they already have are sufficient to balance them against opponents of the same classand problems caldari ships have are mosre to do with underpowerd weapon systems rockets or powergridcpu problemsand last i checked damage per second was more to do with wow or war than it is to do with eve as you would have to divide the damage of each individual weapon by its cycle time i dont see very many people doing this so i guess most people dont use second when they refer to dps v0v
why because missile weapon system was designed with choosable dmg type in mindcaldari ships have many problems kinetic only bonus is one of themdps in eve was always refered as damage per second if you are more familiar with wow then you should go back there

hmm yes maybe i am being a bit harsh just stopping the accumulation while inactive is enough i think
inactive accounts should be exactly that
yes there are many ways to look at this however at the end of the day rl happens mistakes get made active players fall off for short periods of timeperrigrene captured exactly what this proposal is about stopping a specific exploit while not going off the deep endthis issue has potential to suffer greatly from scope creep possibly to the point of being unusable by the csm and ccp therefore it addresses datacores and only datacores for the reasons below
i support this

as long as the corporation is active why should a single character going in active have an impact on their corporate activities market orders manufacturing jobs research jobs  these will all eventually time out anywaywhat will you do with the manufacturing slots of jobs that are paused while a player is inactive how many players would it take to gum up all manufacturing slots in empire space with subcapital manufacturing jobs that are eternally pausedjust let the job finish there are swings and roundabouts  such as not allowing actual delivery of a job that finished while an account was inactive the manufacturing slots are cleared no time is wasted from what has already been invested in manufacturingresearching and there are no special cases to code around

excellent and well explained ideas they have my supporti would however contribute with one small idea about implementing target priority have assignunassign to target priority queue hotkeys select target in overview and press a assign key it goes in target queue on first available place updown arrow buttons on drone tactical interface so when you select one target you can move it updown to change place priority in target queuesomeone may have objection to idea based on assumption about boosting afk missioning but it is not true you cant put target from spawn wave that hasnt spawned yetsomeone may object that it would give drones advantage in lag situations like large fleet fights when targeting and activation weapons is not easy this would be very jealous since its hard to launch drones anyway in lag but once they are launched and assigned target queue they would be useful thus giving balance as of fleet drone commander drone control range has to be somehow disregarded possibly by assigning all drones to commander needs new number of assigned drones skill also i think that commander is better at squad level since drones may be dispersed over large area in case of fleet op area drones would need to travel a loti think for start its best to implement it only for fightersand only for fighters on the same grid they can warp to target if distance is over 150 km that would give something to carriers and momsbut great idea im actually smiling while typing this as opposed to my otherwise stone face of deprived drone user 
they do have a physicks phd its the one who wrote the original physiks engine and filled the eve universe with leftover beer if i remeber correct he is specced in chaos physiks they sent him to china though where he tries to find a way to fill the planetary enviroments with beer one must be at least consistent afterall the eve starsystems themselves are physically correct other than planet velocities that are set to zero for now i mean you can have planets with that kind of masses in those locations where they are in reasonably stable manner its just parameters other than mass of those planets and moons that do not make a lot of sense and seem to have implemented in some random manner as aftertought what i would also love to see but its ofc not as essential as correct planetary information is some irregularity in the shapes of moons that are too smalllight to condense properly into spherical form under their own gravity and as far as too heavy marines go  i have always assumed that they carry some kind of power armor and heavy equipment on that
the reasoning behind this is written hereill just copy the very gist of itthe current role bonus 99 reduction in warfare link module cpu need becomes doublesided and includes reduction in power grid need too moreover the new role bonus now includes a 58 or even 10  bonus to effectiveness of warfare links per level but  and this is the most important  at a cost of vastly increased cap use amount of warfare links in addition the ship becomes immune to captransfering thus making it a shortterm gang booster which can activate its link links dunno whether we should implement a onelink only restriction prolly we should only for a very limited period of timethis new revamped role bonus is the feature field command ships are really really lacking at the moment
field command ships are made of win and pwnwith the exception of the nighthawk which is made of the pve equivalents to win and pwn and need no changes they have a role and its a good one dont mess around with it especially not for these rather weak reasons
lolsorry man but calling nh a pve ship just shows your cluelessness along with new sleipnir nh is the best cs around
i read your reasoning and while i agree on the analysis of tier 1 bcs imo both field and fleet cs could at most use a slight buff to pgcpu anything more and they become much too powerful you could even say that your videos are proof they are already overpowered id rather see rebalancing within the field cs class
signed
fleet command ships cannot be overpowered simply cause they have no rivals at their intended role  wide area gang boosters thats like calling covert ops overpowered in terms of scanningbut this thread has nothing to do with fleet onesthe suggested overhaul has nothing to do with my vids either thats just a mean to give field command ships a distinct feature which wouldnt be a direct tankgank boost so i dont see any problems hereand this really became an issue with the introduction of tech3 cruisers which for some weird reason got a 25 bonus for gang link effectiveness
so do you use the fit with 2x rcu or the one with 4x rcu

long long overdue i await this with every major expansion and am disappointed each time i hope that we can get this in the first half of 2010 given that the vast majority of eve centers upon the corporation our weak corp management features are very out of placethe current rolestitles system is incredibly rigid which is out of place in in a game focused around customization ceos are forced to work around the system as opposed to working with it we have far too many bundled privileges and broad applicationswhile were at it a better gui for corp management would be much appreciated

if dominion had just been a complete rewrite of how roles work with no other changes i would have been incredibly happy this is almost literally the game itself were talking about here corp structure directly impacts every player besides the lone wolvesif you polled every ceo in eve youll find nearly unanimous support to change the the system and agreement that its holding us back i can think of dozens of changes that i would immediately make to my corporations fundamental structures if i could build user groups with granular permissions and apply them either globally or to specific stationstowersif ccp has any worries about learning curve as if the current system were easy to figure out they can provide a set of predefined usergroups which are globally applicable and match up to the current sets of roles

to get a better idea of this proposal it is suggested that you have images enabled in your forum settingsthis is the second version of this proposal this topic was brought up in a csm meeting and was denied for various reasons but mostly due to the fact that i hadnt properly explained the idea and covered negative issues that could arise here is the full proposalproposal version 2introduce player made blocklist libraries that you can subscribe tomake blocklists tradeable items or linkable like items dropped into chatblocklist librariesblocklist libraries are player made blocklists that can be shared with the community via subscription or as tradable items like bookmarksyou would still see people on the blocklist library in your chats but they would be less visable see example picture belowconflict controls in the blocklist menu to filter people on the library that youd not want blockedexport blocklist to filewhen a blocklist library is edited by the original maker the blocklist is updated to all subscribers you would have to agree to any changes to the blocklist library before they would be activated in your chat channelseach chat window would have a toggle to turn the active blocklist library on or offimport blocklist library people to personal blocklistas a tradable item a new player run industry would be createda new option would be added to the menu when your rightclick a person in a chat channel to add them to the conflict menusee belowplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesblocklist library menuconflict controlthis would be a system to filter and control people who are on a blocklist library that youd still want to see normally in your chat window and help identify who these people are for example a block list library may be made by a person in an enemy alliance which has members of your alliance or corp in it the conflict menu would tell you which people on this library are friends in your alliance or corp friends to your alliance etc full blocks  personal block listpeople on the blocklist library that you are sure you dont ever want to see at all can be transfered from the blocklist library to your personal blocklist here this would also list everyone you have on your personal blocklistplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesexample blocklist library menu version onecomments and suggestions are welcometamber
id like to suggest that it be possible to auto dock to first station in system when autopilot is onohh keep the 15 k range on gates and also on stations taking a freighter 35 jumps really subsitutes taking a handfull of sleeping pills id like to see that you either get the option to dock to a station of choice or just first one then at least you can set and forget for a while so that time is spent more creatively eg leave and come back to see that you have either moved your stuff or have been podded
i vote on first station
sorry if you dont want to stay at the keyboard its a price you gotta pay there are two methods of travel for a reason after all wtz and ap theyre far more balanced than they used to be even at the keyboard was 15km away from the gatenot supported
i like it will make autopilot users feel safer and thus make them more vulnerable to attack in some situations also a nice feature for autopilot usersthis isnt really game breaking i am curious to know how many afk autopiloters are killed each day
perhaps you could fine tune the autopilot system a small bit byadding the ability to specify a station not just a systemthis would be useful in the accept a mission autopilot to system then figure out which station you need to go tothen heading off to the stationitd be nice to autopilot all the way to the doori mean honestly would you expect for a civ as advanced as one with translight tech not to be able to autopilot doortodoor
nopeno no noafk aping is stupid foolish it needs to stay that waymaking it easier by allowing them to dock up inspite of maintaining certain conditions is going to make it much worsethis insures a level of safety where previously it did notthe risk needs to stay in the game not get nerfed out of it
if you cant be bothered to at least check in on your autopiloting freighter every so often that is your problemtldr  no
this whole thread is full of ppl who want to substantially increase the risk for the peaceful inhabitants of 00 for their own benefit however theres nothing to increase the reward00 is already unsafe and not all that rewarding dominion helped a lot true but for rewards as iskhour seems to be the only reward ppl keep referring to youre still better off in highsec
paulthewise youre absolutely right and this is why l4s or their level of income must be not available in empire but this is offtopic here
the delayed local sounds fine but there really needs to be a system to spot allies in system instantly even modern combat vessels have identification codes to identify them as frendlies and there is no reason why they would want to hide this info from allies rp wise it wouldnt be an issue since the game assumes instant information transfer to multiple outside entities alreadyconcord insurance current local all you would need to do is say that the info is now encrypted to hide it from everyone else as for gameplay a system that wouldnt allow this could work decently with small tight organisations but the larger it gets the more cumbersome it becomes just defferentiating your own from others shouldnt be a chore that you are forced to repeat constantly that would propably make some happy but it smells more like bad game design that would be hard to justify for rp or gameplay reasons if you plan on nuking local totally you need to come up with some better intel tools to replace it than we currently have a counter for allied ships in the system would be the absolute minimum here too
showing the amount of people in local without their details would be finefor those hung up on finding afk cloakers before supporting this proposal you realize that their major source of intel is local chat right and that without it theyd be stuck being active and reduced to using the same tools that you do in order to find anything out right in other words itd be that nerf to afk cloakers that some people keep asking for
this also increases the risk to the attacker the attacker doesnt know that the cloaked scout saw him enter the system that the ratter in the belt is bait and that reinforcements are waiting at a deep safe just outside of his scan range because the attacker doesnt get a full count of who is in the system  only what can be seen on scan this change makes life harder for gate camps 2 gates in the system youre camping one and a new name pops up in local load the guns boys here comes one every downside of this hurts careless pilots on both sides attack and defense every updside benefits smart pilots on both sides attack and defense
not sure about the specifics of this iteration but but tradeable kill rights and a proper bounty hunting mechanism have been asked for for many years if theres a profession thats uber cool then this one wears sunglasses at nighti wish you the best of luck in getting ccp to introduce something that many people would enjoy
whats to stop some high sec greifer using an alt to place a bounty on some hapless miner in order to harass them in high sec without concord or corporation interference
1 a bounty can only be assigned to a pilot who is on the kill list of the bounty assigning pilot thus by a pilot who was killed by one or more other pilots
you should only be able to place bounty if you were killed by someone who did not have the rights to shoot you much like kill rights works currently im not so sure about no shooting back though especially because that way stupid things like drone autoaggro would void your right to post the bountyalso i would suggest that the bounty target should simply be flagged to all bounty hunters i personally would propose flagging towards all militia members but just bounty hunters work too i guess  as long as you dont have to join some npc corp or pseudoalliance to become one im not sure how much sense it makes to train fast talk v to become a bounty hunter especially as its a pirate skill  its primary function is making recovering sec status easier but hell if thats what it takesexclusive contracts as proposed would defeat the whole affair because the pirate can just buy out his own contracts  and also because the bounty hunter would have to go solo against the usual crapton of neutral repper bsi cant yet propose anything better than the deduction from insurance idea my own proposal is much less elegant but there may have to be some sort of a limit on the bounty in that case otherwise a noob who as much as fired a shot at the victim and ends up with multimillion bounty as a result likely wont live to ever see it cleared off his dumb posterior
i havent read the op and i wont now im 100 against this idea ever seeing the light of day because the op cross posted this in to every forum i read plus i had a better idea and i know this without reading the op
any place to see your idea
i think with a bit more constructive input from the community this could be the way to do bounty hunters
too convoluted and messyyou have to get fast talk v 4x skill which means a 20 day train how many combat pilots have any points in charisma that you know ofthen you have to train a 5x skill one bounty for each skill then hope that the 13 bounties that you picked up are online at the time not docked up at a pos etcas posted above what if they fly a frig nah nobody flies a rifter what if it is a t2 ship i get 23m for killing an assault frigate 510m for killing a hacstrategic cruiserdont bring a friend though that will cut your already very poor profits in half the risk vs reward on this is completely out of proportiontldr train for 20 days to get a shot at risking a 50 mil ship for a gain of a couple million where do i sign up
we need either a fixed payout for the pod or a payout depending on implants destroyed ofcource t2t3 ships need to pay out properly and not their insurance values this proposal goes way further then vast majority of what i have seen on the forum and even though their are some holesit is well worth discussing and being brought up we also need the timeframe to be established by the person that is giving out the bounty contract maybe i whant to put 1 bill on his ass and have him hunted for a year we also need to allow corporation to accept the contracts does a random person killing him in lownullsec get payed out as par of the bounty or maybe the guy that orders the bounty can choose percentage payout from 1 to 1000 of the ships value and can choose what ships he whants to pay out for maybe he does not whant to pay out for any t1 ships pods and shuttles maybe he whants the guys carrrier to be killed then the onoly ship he will select is a carrier and entire bounty will be given out at that point anyway support
bounty hunting is one of the coolest things that set eve apart from other games and a proper system to make it an official and legitimate profession would put eve yet another mile ahead of everyone elsein eve you have the right to be as nefarious or as carebear as you want so long as you are willing to deal with the consequences this has been ccps attitude on most eve related matters over the years time and time again ccp does not want to disallow something there just has to be consequences to your actions and this fits in perfectly with thatthis is one way to help the helpless and empower newer players who are less than pvp experts usualy need to be to kill someone who hunts for fun gate campers excluded and would give all the grieffers something to do either working together on bounties or hunt each other and thus result in less bored grieffing of newer players and bored grieffers making money grieffing correct me if im wrong but thats a winwinwin olders players are happy newer players get some sort of resolve for crimes commited ccp gets more newer players sticking aroundsupport this and whatever comes of it
not supportedthe idea of renovating the bounty system is an old one with the understanding that this implementation needs more fleshing out it seems like a proposal that will get torpedoed by the what if this happens crowdthat and your post in cp was trolly and wasted cpu cycles
i have put a link to this post into my signature to promote it that is as far as i know not crossposting i have explicitly posted an information about this proposal in the crime and punishment board because the pilots frequenting it would be affected the most by it i have not posted just one sentence of my op at some other place so no cross posting again i can only guess why you dont like this proposal 
thank you all for your support so far im fully aware that i cannot provide a complete and loophole free idea i just try to propose something which includes as much as i think needs to be included to make bounty hunting workable and unabusableas we have already seen here together with others this can turn out to become a good enough idea to get it on the table of the csm and probably to find a ccp dev to make it happenthat pirates dont like it is only natural
i forgot to support this when i posted
i like the idea of bounty hunting being a viable profession i would go as far as suggest that completing bounty contracts would also provide a small security status boost much like killing npc pirates
i have an idea linked hereit needs work but maybe some of it along with those of the op and several other post popping up here and there we can come up with a solutionalso ignore the emo it guy who is narrow minded to my post

yeah i made this post before our yesturday discussion while i disagree that generc rig would be badas you could have speshialised rigs being much more effective then the generic ones i think you are right and we doo need much more them just a generic cpu rig as currently alot of rigs are imbalanced resistance and weapon rigs need a buff gravity capacitor rig and a droe repair augmenter are utterally useless rigs need to be seoresly overlooked in general and balanced

really simple if someone steals your wrecks you should be able to pop them cant say the countless times i have someone in a frig show up where im doing missions to try to start stealing my salvage and there is nothing i can do about it
seriously posting topics regarding stealing salvage should be a bannable offensehe cant steal what aint yours
its npc mission salvage its just as much mine as whats in the containers which will give you kill rights whats the differencenone go troll elsewhere
they stole my salvage tears are the best tearsexcept perhaps for goon tears

i see where youre coming from but these mods dont exactly inspire confidence for carebears to flock to lo sec and mission or mine wcs are only useful in transports they dont really help pve ships much hics can easily lock any battleship running missions in lo sec also probing mechanics are ridiculously broken and in favor of the predator you can probe down a mission runner in seconds and in almost complete silence couple this with killboard s camping lo sec entry points and killing just about anything that moves and it becomes clear that lo sec just isnt meant for pve
hello alli think we can all agree that the poses as they exist today are a logistical nightmare and a general pain to work with it is for this reason that i designed a groundup reworking of their mechanicsi would like to give credit to those who helped me refine this proposal evelgrivions assistance with the basic idea and the threads about the reworking were the foundation of this document herschel yamamoto song li and phoenixdawn helped me refine the document as well as some of the people from the features and ideas thread i created for itthe document is now worked out enough to be a good starting point for implementation but more work is always needed and constructive criticism is always welcomed i am looking for a graphic artist to help me with an image of the pos control ui so any help is welcomed and some payment can be arranged if necessary however without further ado heres the document
fueling does need streamlined and if we could get the pos system condensed so its an all in one unit it would be great atleast allow prod units to pull materials from a corp hanger without manually moving the items it could utilize some tweakung short term though without a massive rework
supporting this as i have for the past uh farking forevereditim not sure i agree entirely with the ice mining changes however partially because i seem to recall ccp saying they dont want to remove static belts for one reason or another another way to achieve a similar end might be to add a fuel type requirement for something that can only be found in the new scannable sites but adding more fuel types seems like a step backwards
pos are soooo broke its not even funny or fun to want to bother with themthey need to be ripped down recoded revamped and reissued in a more logical easier to manage more fun less chore designthis is a game not a job were not getting paid for the managing the nightmarish things were paying to have to deal with them thats just brokenget er fixed ccp
as demonstrated by current t2 market prices particularly for ships t2 invention has taken a serious hit in the latest patch nothing definitive has been discovered but polling experienced t2 ship bpc inventers will show a decrease in success rates in almost every instancewith this in mind its time to even the playing field if its now more difficult to invent a t2 bpc then its time to get rid of the t2 bpos the economic advantage they give their owners is far beyond what could remotely be considered fair i realize that many of you will scoff at my using that word in eve but a level playing field has always been a part of ccps goal the continued existance of t2 bpos drastically skews the markets i realize that removing t2 bpos will have a hugely negative impact at the eve tribune and i apologize for that im willing to contribute to the tribune to help make up for the loss since im proposing the idea but i cant let that be a deciding factor in addressing this issuemy proposal is that t2 bpos be converted to 50run bpcs in order to give some further but shortlived advantage to those who possess them that will allow their owners time and resources to get into the invention process that the rest of the industrialist base must utilizethe goal of weapon balancing speed nerfs and a whole host of other changes has been for a better balance and more pvp opportunities  do the same for the industrialists pvp is the heart of the market allowing a ship that cant be killed to go out and kill other ships would bring unanimous calls for either nerfing or destroying this bugged ship eve is about newer players being able to compete with more experienced players on a fairly even playing field in relatively short order  in no other aspect of eve is an older more experienced player rewarded with an asset that so long as they are reasonably careful can never be taken away and will provide them with a constant and continuing advantage no matter how skilled their opponent becomes in an arena where more isk is risked by even the small players every week than most pvprs risk in a month its time that winning is based on player skill and a bit of luck not on flying an indestructable ship its time to get rid of t2 bpostho only other reasonable proposal is to make it possible for newer players to obtain new t2 bpos and i dont think anyone is going to seriously consider that
bpos and inventions are balanced seriouslystop whininggreetings from a happy inventor
yeah remove t2 bpos
how about stop whining about the bpos existing and actually work out the profits on these bpos this isnt the days of the lottery anymoret2 bpos dont make nearly as much profit as they used to invention makes far more and in a lot of cases is actually responsible for the low prices for most of the t2 items that you see todaythe reason that t2 prices are going up is because of the requirements being changed in dominion and because of the market pvp being conducted over technetiumgive the t2 producers time to adjust to the dominion changes and you will probably see prices start to stabilise
1 learn how a random number generator work nothing has changed in success ratio2 the material required to produce t2 ships have been changed and the market is still in a state of flux that is the reason why invention is less rewarding but it is a temporary state
this
then removing them wont be a huge problem for their owners or the market 
this thing comes up regularly it regularly gets beaten downi call it a solution looking for a problemyou try to solve a problem that doesnt existand cheating everyone who bought their t2 bpo out of their money isnt a solution either
just give them 3 years worth of bpc runs and that excuse is also gonesupporting proposals of doing away with relics of bad game design
the days when t2 bpos made fantastic profits are long gone the profits are still there but they are not substantially greater than inventing i invent and have t2 bposprevious stats from dr g have demonstrated that t2 bpos make up a very small percentage of the total production of t2 stuff the effect of mass invention has been to reduce the price of t2 stuff to the point where most are well below that of named or faction modules there is no evidence for the ops statement that t2 bpos drastically skew the markett2 bpos now have the effect of keeping prices down as they produce in bulk where inventors produce in small batches market manipulation of bulk materials is more difficult to achievepersonally i have seen no changes in invention success ratesthe op needs to research his topic more effectively and provide real statistical evidence for his proposal this has all been well aired before
currently bpos sell at roughly 57years roi yes it is a bit overprized but people pay it and did you notice the op had 50 run copies this is kind of lol making bpos worth billion into a bpc worth less than 10mi dont own any bpo but i still dont see them as a problem show me any bpo owner that can produce 1020 lines of the same item in parallel and that is what balances bpos and inventionsacarsmi wonder why nobody cries about all those old t1 producers with their highly researched t1 bpos maybe we should reset them once in a while again so they have to research them again they have such an advantage over us newcomerespecially with those capital bpossacarmas everyone likes numbers we track the success rate of our inventions the average has been around 481483 for the whole time of our tracking roughly 1y
im an inventor and i think your idea is silly its fine learn to play
i missed the good ol days of bpos i say bring them back but let the invention process remain in existance as well
agreedto all the naysayersyes you do get warnings but they are not significant being warp disrupted is a very important matter in this game because it is responsible for almost all ship losses the notification that you should receive should be proportional to its significance currently you only get two warnings one of them a short message in the middle of your screen that can get easily flooded by weapon damage notifications another the tiny 13x13 pixel icon on the edge of your overview in my opinion the warnings should be more visible
id like to have an audio warning at every time a notification were to pop up also id like to know how many of which type of point is being put on me even if the tiny little icons were different colours itd be near impossible to tell which is dark blue and which is light blue at a glance
i missed the snipe but i have 1 thing to sayyou can not warp because you are warp scrambled
recognition can come from player corporations if they so choose to award them for character more than anything else or they can make up titles that have meaning in the corporation joining fw also can net you rankaward but that is pvp so you still have the certificates for non pvp as a non pvper i know killmails are crap anyway plenty of them are noobs or industrial ships etc or wow a gang of 5 people took out 2 ships hooray for you and your killmail it is a meaningless award but acquiring them en masse says something which is up to everyone to decide for themselves i see ranks as pointless because i dont need anyone to recognize the skills ive learned beyond the fact that i can do this and that so i can add to a group in certain ways advertising them isnt something i do or would do anyway
because artificial ranks ascribing qualities to pilots that may or may not exist based on a broken certificate system is a terribad idea that rewards rote following of crap over actual experienceive played this game for over 3 years and am apparently only core competent at the basic level why ive never felt the need to lock more than 6 targets oopsif you want real rank and recognition for what you do chat with your corp if not wellknown throughout eve like chribba you can be recognised for what you do for your comrades  and if youre nice enough they can even give you trinkets for it
lets not forget that a week old player can beat the crap out of a several year old player player skills  ingame skills
and interesting idea but no thanks the current certificate system means very little when a corporation will often want experience over sp and lets be fair sp is something you generate from doing nothingthe below point also highlights another key issueive never understood allot of certificates the core give a clear example  very few ships gain anything from the skill multitasking so why is it classed as skill requirement for coredont take the negativity as anything personal though
supported whenever ccp can get around to it
minor but handy odd that it doesnt work this way already but it should be easy to copy the code over
i would like this
would very much like this as well
hopefully instead of copy  paste theyll refactor it properly this time thoughsince this is probably due to duplicated code it might even fall under the umbrella of the corification process they keep talking about 
sounds good to me
supportedalso change the killmail format in the api to xml or something else more easily machineparseable or add a second format ship fittings can be exported as xml so why not killmails

i had the npc imbalance issue in my npc thread and was told that this is already being addressed by the csmsupported of course i still think npcs should be removed completely and replaced with a a minigame to discourage afkplexing b a notifcation to the hostile militia to encourage actual fights and c a minimum ship size requirement to capture both for attackers and defenders to encourage using more than t1 frigates npcs in any form discourage cool fights
supportednpc should not be in the focus of plexing at all being able to solo them for each faction in a proper ship should be possible to still allow solo players to soloremoving npcs all together with something else eg mini game hacking the plex after maybe killing just one initial medium difficult wave would be niceplexes should keep you in space for a while so the other side has to time to get there spreading intela notifcation to the hostile militia though imho is job of the players if one side is to lazy or to stupid to guard their own space its their loss keep it active players vs active players rather lazy blobbers vs lazy blobbers
agreed and supportedone of many issues we hope to see addressed before soontm
supported for everyone except lexa hellfury
create a new skills that when trained to lvl5 cuts the timer down to 12hrs it can be a high level skill to train i dont care it would make my life and im sure many other people lives in the game so much better
not really a new proposal and nounfortunately what makes your life easier not better btw is not necessarily in the best interests of the game im not opposed to the idea of a skill to reduce the timer but 10 per level is too sharp a decline
why do people continue to post repeating proposals that fail and yet they keep trying
theres a far simpler way to approach the jump clone problemlinkapparently its possible to visit at least 3 different systems in a given day not counting where the character may have been before the board meeting or after dinnerrather than make another skill which reduces the timer just tweak the current skill to function properlynowhere in that description does it say the mind is taxed by having several inert clones around the cosmos it says the mind is taxed by the effort of moving between themso simply change the skill to allow 1 clone per level and 1 jump per daythen if you train lvl i you have 1 clone and can jump to it once a day as it is todayif you train lvl v you can have up to 5 clones and could jump between any of them up to 5 times in a day
just being able to clonejump at all is powerful enough i think the timer is fine as is
agreed a much better proposal is one i saw in another discussion allow more frequent jumpclones but only allow the player to jumpclone to a new clone in their current station or to a jumpclone in a rorqual or titan has the added bonus of making the capital clone vat bays actually useful
drake draconis yes it is a very small nerf and as i said remove them covops cloak when if the local window also gets removed it really bothers me when you choose to read half the sentence which is the last and least important point anyway as for you malcanis spherical and m2 are you even doing any math mixing meters with kilometers while you try to prove something just shows that no you dont know what youre talking about small ships now they do get instapopped if they have their mwd on which has a cycle of 10s actually anything that has a signature larger than 400m eg dictors it will receive 100 damage and even if it gets a smaller percentage of that that   8k is enough to dip it low into armorstructure or maybe instapop it 7 times that damage youve got yourself a miniddyour alliance is not under any scrutiny by me and using your alliance name to prove something doesnt really prove anything my alliance does rr bs gangs i didnt mention it all why should i hey guys im rzr were pro i write something its true because im rzrthe goal is to balance bombers ways of getting into a system is completely irrelevant if youre talking about bridging people in through a cyno well that makes bombing even easier as ships appear uncloaked next to the cynoanyway im done caring for this thread the proposal is there the facts are stated lets see what the csm has to say about this
not supportedwhat is the problem with bombers btw other than the laggy situations
so you want bombs speed cut in half and think that bringing the explosion radius do you mean velocity up is enough to counter ithonestly if youre in a bomber and you die to smartbombs youre doing it wrong completely wrongalso bss should not be blobbed nor should they sit stationary if you pay attention to your overview or are not set up against it rr snipe you can escape a typical bomb run if youre good not supported bombs are just fine the way they are
we were talking about killing bombs with smart bombs not the stealthbomber itself

i wouldnt object to a forum of this sortthough id think of it as morte of a spacebook change than one for immediate addition except for one small problemsorry dude you may be offering a lottery but youre offering an eve lottery the only time scams are banned in eve is when real money is paid to ccp to secure the trade  ie characters or gtcs other than that its caveat emptor this is simply wrong for this game for that matter you even assume the eve standard of finding a third party you trustor f9 to secure the contract because its not secured by any sort of court system naturally remove that clause and your plan may be workable but as is its just wrong
op lacks content locked
a simple request but an important one i believebring back the old cyno effect the new one is really unimpressive and has none of the grandeur the original one does
bump me instead

i pay for my account if i want to let my character sit in a station for a few hours or all day i can do that me and my isp have this arrangement where i give them money and they let me use their tubes ccp gets my money cause that arrangment existsalso your proposal clearly favors macro miners since they can be afk mining whether ccp deemed it illegal or not also i wasnt aware ccp had the power to make laws thirdly i dont care about people who are afraid of what another player might do stop playing mmos if that keeps you afeared ingame

tldr minutes will be out later today it has taken longer than previous meetings to prepare these because a the meeting ran even longer than meeting 2 raw logs are 200kb i had a family birthday to attend after the meetingc im suffering from manflu pim halfway done so they will be completed and published tonight gmt as pointed out above the raw logs are available on the wiki
dear ccpthis friend of mine and me often talk about eve during coffee drinking rituals that often occur in our society and quite often he whines gallente sucks blaster sucks dont bother to use failguns and more similar commentsand please do try to balance stuff cuz he doesnt like to be pwned by minmatar ships and give those players a chance to play the game and not spend time on forum whining or even worse switch on caldari
i still stand by my original suggestion that outside of triage the rep should be slow and purely for recovering drones damaged in hull after a fight etchowever when triage mode is active you should be able to rep at high speed making it a viable new strategic option for carriers consuming some sort of fuel nanite paste ozone stront or etc in my eyes it should be something which can be mined or collected easily just like triage fuelon motherships the mode should be able to be activated at any point in time but should still consume fuel changed this due to the removal of triage from moms

greets to allproposal inclusion of an option to disable avatars  portraits within chat channel participant listingwhy currently players are able to choose between zero small and large portraits in chat channelsplayers can also choose to display no participant listingworking with dozens of open windows or low resolution displays one aims to cram as much relevant information into any given windowcurrently the largest element in any chat window is the participant list and it cant be reduced or resized effectively forcing a minimum window sizethe option to disable the portraits and simply display the names of participants and relevant corporation  standings icons will alleviate thisbenefits less clutter enables smaller participant listings fewer requests on tq for portraits  avatars upon clicking on a channel participants nameuseful for rapidly changing and popular channels the help channel anyone and particularly for finding specific individuals within said channeldetriments coding  ui team time allocation obviously makes local chat somewhat easier to use as an intel toolplease feel free to add suggestions  comments but if this has already been raised although i havent found something similar do let me know
supporting this
fairly confident that there is a setting to only pull portraits when you click on a character as all portraits are blank for me unless i click on someone i seem to recall finding out about this once upon a time before a large fleet fight in the prefight turn everything off speechfound it escgeneral settingsgeneralx generate character picture when clicked
i believe the op was also looking to reduce the realestate used in the participant list even if you do not click to get the portrait a portrait sized amount of space with the noportrait graphic is shown making the participant list longer than neededi believe the request is for an option as there is in the chat window itself to not show any sort of graphic and just have a list of names and appropriate badgesi support this idea
ah yes that would be nice for local and large fleets really could care less what the persons portrait looks like
your third party app  numbers are erroneous  the numbers i have given you are taken straight from the game  dps adjusted for for lack of neccessary skillsthe cane is faster and cap stable the drake isntyour dps numbers for the drake are way off  i have in game produced more dps than your are calculating even with less than perfect skillsthe point you seems to be happily ignoring and dismissing off hand as ok  is the drake losses 25 of it firepower whereas the cane does not
cause if they could use their weapon system to its full potential it would be a bit overpowered tbhyuhh you can change missile typesyou just might not get bonused to themnot like youre getting penalized
ham drake677 dps 80318 ehp as earlier stated i did not claim 82k the plus 1 pg is fine with a pg2 implant try adding it to ur all vs profile if you dont believe meiirc the fitting window in eve does not take into account active modules so you were getting the ehp for my fit with the invuls turned off eft takes this into account with this in mind it also gives 90853 with the invuls overheating so there you have it almost bs level ehp dps to rival any gank bc only requires the 2 mil isk pg2 implant not the 20 smth mil isk pg4 your cane does is actually a bit faster than your cane has ability to over heat for even higher ehpyes imo this would be stupidly op given full dmg on emexp missiles and i actually fly the damn thing
i fully support this ideaon another stay on topic

stil im sure ive already told you to stop trolling and go home but just for old times sake ill continue to prove you wrong as i always havea no they wouldnt and b if they would then just nerf them a bit in a slightly more reasonable fashionyou lose 25 damage youre not getting penalized huh this is why i say youre trolling because you cannot possibly be this stupid
on the other hand weve got the fact that the kin damage bonus is balanced on ships that arent already suffering from other unconnected problemsand also anyone who claims the eve fitting screen details are more accurate than evefit needs to sit back and think about it for a second because 1 it doesnt take active modules into account and 2 they need to check that all the modules are actually online no ship without a considerable amount of cap regen which is to say more than one cap recharger on a lolfit could ever impart is going to be cap stable when mwding cap stability with mwd and without gimping the ship is only possible for asssault frigates
nvm cba
youll see if you look at the screenie that the hardners are active as is the dcu  the screenie was taken is spaceyou drake fit has 61k ehp not 80kehpas battleships routinelly surpase 100kehp your drake fit has only 60 the buffer of a bsthere may be some small difference in speed i did not measure ita 20m pg implant is nothingconsidering you cant constantly overheat your hardners and they have a 10 second cycle time  you would be lucky to get more than a couple of extra kehp from overheating as you would have to wait for yourself to be called primary and then wait for the hardner cycles to finish before activating overheat by which time a lot of the primary buffer would be gonebut yeah maybe you can squeeze a couple of extra k out of overheatthe cane fit is complettly cap stable  whilst the drake fit can only manouver on mwd for approx 4 minutes before it has to stop using its mwd or risk losing large amounts of ehpi never said this fits are identical  i said they are similaris the cane fit op doing mostly emexp with rf emp or fusion 
the kin bonus is not balanced at all  as shown numerous times a pilot only gets 13rd the damage output benifit on average compared to rofdpl damage bonuses if he fires optimal ammo for training time spent on those hullsthe eve fitting screen does take into account module activation if you are in space and switch on those modulesyou can check this for yourself the next time you play eveonline instead of evefit offline
typo fixed noob looking at your bc record you barely fly caldari ships anyway or any ship larger than a frigate that explains the hurricane lolfit at least lets see the last missile boats lost are a badlyfit aml drake oh the lolfit blasterferox is nice though a stupid crow rigour with rockets a lolafterburning passive faildrake a rocket manticore seriously and a purger iirigged nighthawk good griefits fair to say that my experience and knowledge of missile pvp is far in excess of yours
s nvm ill get round to this later i have flu 
dude i probably know more about pvp in eve in any form that doesnt revolve around jita that you ever will just as i know that eft is more accurate a judge than eve itself just as i know from experience that a hurricane cannot be cap stable whilst mwding just as i know that the drakes bonuses are balanced well against other ships in game just as i know that the problems of other caldari ships cannot be fixed by a blanket buff that does not effect the problems those ships haveplease fail more your giving me something to laugh at whilst snowedunder at home
like i said  egountil you can get over yourself you wont be able to be constuctive in this topic because it wasnt you that realised what the problem with cmbs isgypsio has earned the right to claim he is a better pvpr than me and he iseven if his subsequent ego prevents him from accepting that anothers view of a facet of this game may be correctyou however are nothing more than an eft warrior and a really bad one at thatuntil yesterday when i explained it to you you didnt even know what dps meantyou know less than nothing about pvp judgeing from your non existant pvp record
translation  anyone disagreeing with me is being unconstructivepush for the change all you want my position has been the same all along  the bad missile boats are bad not because of a kinetic bonus but because they lack fittings or because rocketscruise needs fixing or because of shield transfer cpu requirements youre attempting to claim that one simple change will fix these ships but it isnt that simple and they deserve to be fixed properlyindividual ships deserve individual fixes blanket changes are crude and lazy its interesting to note that the recent blanket projectile ammo changes gave the biggest boosts to ships that didnt really need boosting that much  rifter hurricane vaga sleipnir  while not really fixing although obviously it did help them the weaker minnie ships such as cyclone awkward split weapons shortage of medslots tempest shield or armour awkward slot layout maelstrom shield transporter cputhe proposed blanket af ab bonus was seen to be similarly flawed as it would produce only 3 afs worth flying jag harpy ishkur while completely ignoring the problems of trash like the hawk
thanks i will push for the changeyou keep describing this as a blanket change but its not reallyim asking for a bonus to be changed  one single bonusthat bonus is applied to many ship types but its still only one type of bonusindividual fixes are not currently possible that will make cmbs balancedwhy because a ship that has a 16 per level damage bonus can never be balanced against a ship that has a 5 per level damage bonusa 16 bonused ship can be balanced versus a 5 bonused ship at any given player skill levelit is therefore mathematically impossible for it to be balanced at any other player skill levelfor instanceif x  y  balanced  at level 0then at level 5x5  x   1  0016  5  x5  108  xy5  x   1  005  5  y5  125  xccp can tinker with individual stats on ships giving them better fitting or making the weapons roflkets a bit betterand lets say that now a cmb is balanced at player skill level 5if it still has a 16 per level damage bonus then its impossible for that ship to be balanced against its peer equivelents at lower player skill levelsin order to get there  balanced at lvl5  then the cmb must be overpowered at lower player skill levelsbut even if you they do manage to balance out the cmbs at lvl 5  there would still remain the unfixed issue of low skill players having the same dps as high skill players in 23rd of engagementsprime example is lvl2 cal cruiser pilot in a cara verus a lvl5 cal cruiser pilot also in a caramost damageing heavy thunderboltthe 20 days training done by the lvl5 pilot can in no way help him win the engagement  20 days training down teh toiletall the tinkering with ship stats in the world can never fix the issue that training done on caldari hulls is not equally valuable as training done on the hulls as other races
hilariousso your saying that because i have the sense to use an alt for forum work i have no pvp track record utterly hilariousand im not the one that doesnt realise evesfitting screen is less accurate than the evefit programnor am i the one unable to see a forum alt for what it isnor am i the one unable to understand that balancing is far more complex than hamfisted attempts to boost things in areas they dont need boosting to compensate for unrelated areas that cause them to be fail
this  minmatar got help where it wasnt needed no help where it was needed and a fotm novelty patch up job on arty because of lazy blanket fixingdont repeat that with caldari
gypsio iii strange that you mentioned ham drake as your latest losses only show hml drakes hmm if the ham drake is so good and as you are lowsec pvper wanabee anyway why dont you use ham drakesoh i have more kills than you possibly even with missiles only so according to you that makes me more expert with missiles still no other race loose its dmg bonus by changing ammo type only those not well thought out missile ships with 1 type of dmg bonuseswould changing those make any ships op absolutely not  would those be fixed probably not  would those be less crappy definitelyi see not even one reason why not change those bonuses to not ammo dependant bonusesbtw stop drakeing thx
i shall attempt to answer your question without mentioning the dseveral reasons  my hml damage implant that i got for my cerb the increased tactical flexibility of hms over hams and i had a torp damage implant instead of the pg implant that the ham drake really benefits from in gang i favour hmls over hams because of the ability of hmls to reach out to ecm boat range solo i appreciated the ability to apply dps from the edge of disruptor range  an important consideration when fighting outnumbered often against more mobile opponents and when anything could be baitfurther discussion here
i would like to see a smoother process for bms with many of the changes suggested however the problem i have is with instant sharing of bookmarks and the effect it has for those operating in wh space you become massively more vulnerableat the moment typically a scout scans down a wh enters scouts out the hole for signatures players and pos facilities should any juicy targets turn up they have to exit the wh to share the kspace location of the wh to the rest of their gang this gives two chances to spot the enemy and a little time to respondwith instant bookmark sharing if a scout needs a single positive result to allow the rest of the gang to immediately head to the wh and get in to back them up any nonpvp fit operation mining is toast as the only notification you get is when they are already in warp towards youa counter would be having someone diligently watching the wh for that characteristic flash as a ship enters but it is very boring for that individual to do it also means you waste a playeraccount on that which if whs are for small gangs to succeed in you cant often spare you need to know when the scout enters the point an enemy combat fleet enters a wh is already too late for your gang as from experience tacklers can often align warp and lock faster than a hulk takes to get up to speedas wh are often scanned down in the operating region of the scouts corp finding a fleet to gank that wh mining operation is usually going to be easydont get me wrong i am happy with the pew but sometimes when there is noone or nothing to shoot it can be profitable to spend your time mining if bookmarks could be instantly shared i would cope but instead of living in a wh i would scan down a bunch of whs before prime and then go through each of them until i found a mining op to bring the corp down on this could be further sped up by having all the corp scanning whs and switching to combat ships when the more likely to find opportunities arriveas a suggestion i would implement the majority of the suggestions but require bms to be added to or retrieved from a corpalliancetrusted user bm store in a station outpost or pos the tower would make sense this would allow the benefits of sharing bookmarks in a logical way but also require gank fleets to do a little planning still rather than making it really simple for any opportunistic pilot to bring the rain on every opfor those who operate in wh space having that functionality in a pos is a mustthe roleplay version would be a bm is not merely a location but the alignment data and technical readouts necessary for an accurate warp imagine it being a big big bunch of data specific to your ship with the exported bm you currently have in cargo being the raw data so another ship type could compute it for themselves that way you can argue that pos outpost and station and maybe caps supercaps or blackops bs to expand its role have the additional cpu and comms facilities for massive data transferson a different subject to the above collaborative corpalliance wh operations require bms in cans rather than hangers so any improvement on that lag fest would be greatps this is posted on an alt for security purposes

i sold my 360 to buy parts for my pc was an avid console gamer but alas fps suck on consolehow many good fps are on consolesdidnt the fps start on pcwill it not be harder to develop an expanding role playing game on a limited console machine when do they run out of resources and have to wait for the next gen console to come out360 is nearing the end of its life as istoo many bad console ports have come direct to pc as of late and now they are losing dedicated server support as wellmodern warfare 2where you were able to have massive servers with 40 to 60 people shooting it out the console has dumbed down our gaming experience to a dismal 4v4 because of matchmaking and hosting on less than able console machines will this be true for dust as wellhate to say it but the underwhelming console is officially strangling the pc to death the console gaming pie is too big for ccp to not get into the actionits ok we all like money but its sad to see them slap the people who put them in this position in the first place
i agree console exclusivity for dust makes no scene it can be on console but it also needs to be on pc specially when it is going to be tied directly into eve sov mechanics i think it will just screw up the entire game eve more specifically for the smaller alliance where not many people have consoles the way i see things it will just tighten the mega alliances grip on 00 space which defeats the purpose of dominion as it was designed to make 00 more assessable
id love to see a pc port eventually but i understand how limiting developing for consoles is just look at mass effectid like ccp to consider creating a pc client perhaps some time after the initial release steal some of those tf2 players

corp and alliancewide bm management with proper roles  access rightsdefinetly and fully supportedbesides pos access rights management this is one of the few thigs i would really want in the upcoming patch
the idea is intrestingand fon imho the one who know how to make commands more intresting ships not overpoweredimba just some more specific roleafter all css still will be too vulnerable to neuts  
im pretty sure he knows a bit more about the capabilities of the nh than you do oh and agree with topic more useful role bonus would be very nice
one point we want to keep in mind commandships are supposed to be less attractive to be shoot so they can give the fc a base to stay longer in the fight and also have the bonuses longer making them a bigger threat would void that rolejust a thought
yet another person asking for changes to game mechanics to fit their playstyle without consideration of other playersthe gang link bonus was reduced by ccp for balancing if those reasons for the reduction are no longer valid a look at the bonus may be in ordereverything else you want to accomplish can already be done by tailoring the fitting of the ships as they areif that results in a gimped fit it was intended to prevent the ships being overpowered
what exactly are you talking about how will my playstyle benefit from the proposed changes theres no reason whatsoever to fit a gang link onto field command ship since this results in the reduced performance in other areas and as the efficiency of the said link is the same as at regular tech1 bc its pretty obvious to use latter ones since youre gimping a less valuable damage wise at the first place shipthe gang link bonus was reduced hows that ive been playing since sep 05 and no changes were done for the role bonus of commands ships through all these yearsthe role bonus has always been that stupid and useless it became even more stupid over years with the introduction of tier2 bcs and scsyet again im pointing at strategic cruisers which happen to be better at gang boosting then the command ships class itself how is this balancedi know everyone wants an op ship for themselves see drakes which are considered as fine but this hypocrisy is just getting beyond any limits
its not just the role bonus field cs need a complete rework in general this was supposed to happen in 2009heh
ah the one rcu storyline gear and heavy missiles fit well if you want to get fancy about it who am i to stop you but yes ill admit nighthawks arent my thing i fly gallente so why dont we look at some other opinionsedit the last link is broken and i cant seem to fix it  add  brackets around the csm in the url to make it link to the right page
yeah nighthawk needs some grid but thats not like you cant already use one it just costs you some extra isk and thats it surely it is wrong but the ship itself is not gimped at alli would be more than glad to approve a reasonable change about its grid but thats not the issue i actually tried to raise here

thread
youve already started on the right path  filing a petition the next step is to be patient some petitions take longer than others to answer
probably some but they did the same thing when they banned it pretty publicly in the first place and besides you just have to describe what not how  intentionally warping inside a pos shield that you do not have access to for the purposes of knocking ships outside the shield is a bannable exploit would be a perfectly reasonable way to do it for example
i must agree that a proper list of exploits would be very beneficial so people know what actions can get you banned outside of the usual obvious things hacking botting etc it would be very important to keep the list updated so as to also avoid claims of well x wasnt listedthe list should not describe how to do the action but what the action is for example bumping other ships through a pos shield that is considered locked andor hostile would be sufficient to explain pos bowling others of course would require more descriptions such as a full list of disposable alt uses that are considered exploits
yes ccp should publish some type of list for what is consider to be exploits
seriously needed is this an exploit

excellent idea i would think the 00 news would be named based on the sov holder or the local npc rat population in systems without player sov
hell yeah
not supported the proposed change would give advantage to the hunter and leave the hunted more exposed the hunted are already exposed enough by the constraints of the ships they must use to make what theyre doing worth the time to do itthe proposal would increase the number of support craft for any enterprise not directly involved in pew pew activity fine for large corporations or alliances death for smaller groupslocal currently acts as a general system radar that automaticly scans full time thats a lot better than having to constantly jab a scan button just to see if theres anybody you should be worried about scanning forwindjammer
the intel alternative could be a search burstthis can be a launched pod or a ship fixed moduleit sends out a very large detection pulsefor example 60 to 100 au depending on ths killsthe module remains active from 20 to 40 seconds and ships can warp to it like a normal cynofieldonly probing covops ships can fit it with a higher effectiveness the pulse will then last for 3 to 10 seconds depending on the skillsone ship can only fire such a pulse once every 2 minutes once a puls has been fired there is a spatial distortion in that region that makes a new pulse impossible for 1 minuteinfo will still be available but it will be incompletethe only info given is the amount of manned ships inside the pulse rangemy 2c
no local channel should stay as it is now
this is true but youre missing a huge disparity cloakers wouldnt have to constantly smash the button while the hunted would cloakers have time on their side they can choose when to hunt they choose when theyre ready and subsequently when to press scan everyone else needs to be smashing it always how is that balance

i will argue against this fix again i dont want local but making it just a number will horribly screw up both pve and pvp and general alliance operationspvp  with just a number roams and camps will be nonfunctional see the following situationscamplocal went up bubble up i hate you guys you just bubbled a slow moving fleetgang from your own allianceblock roamingscout jumping in 2 in local make that 3 make that 4eyesno scanning found stuffwell we cant ask in intel channels or alliance as they were littered with spies even before they became the uber intel source they now would be arewarping to them oh just another allianceblock gang sorry guysfleetswell they are horribly difficult to organizemanage as is 255 max fleet size if nothing else making local just a number would lead to mass chaos perhaps a year from now the first 30 minutes of fleet will not have to be spent explaining how to use broadcasts please please please please require everyone who hasnt been to 00 to complete a tutorial on fleet broadcasts  for the love of odinpve  the ratting and mining that dominion was supposed to centralize instead of being spread all over the place would be its undoinglocal went up everyone safe and cloaksorry guys roam coming back youre safeoh noes our 10man mining operation just was bombed to death by a disco raven that jumped in when the roam came back1111alliance  the logistics of simply undocking in a home system would become ridiculously tedious as seen belowanyone know if local is blue in our capital system where local is always full and dominion allows significantly more rattingmining to go on in a single system leading to much larger local populations that are not docked so comparing docked count to local count will not workrepeat every 30 seconds as each pilot wants to do something but has to make sure they are safe to followed by an inevitableim dying11111 you said it was blue1111it was 30 seconds ago sorryin short you would need to add additional things to the change as op laid out for it to be functional specifically a fof system of some form for each case
as a sneaky cloaker type you would think id love no local but no go live in wh space and leave the game alone againhow many of these have we said no to know 400 more
supported but we need a viable way for finding out who is in the system without overloading the server
definately agree 00 space should be dangerous not the current situation where people can run to a pos or station as soon as a neutral or red ship arrives im not saying it should be changed to the extent that a whole fleet can jump into a system raep all the miners or ratters they can find and leave without anyone having a clue they were there til the kms appearitd certainly force people to wake up start playing the game tactically and encourage some teamwork
supporting butif you cloak you must show up in local immediately
there is a reason they all run to station it is just not profitable to start sitting with a pvp fleet besides the miners to defend them and ships to run anomalies with just like missions dont have a chance against pvp shipsso then the only result would be that in beginning there are many easy ganks on the pve ships then they go run lvl 4 missions in high sec
i have scored 2 kills with a pod although i like the points i get for these they really should be fixedhappens when an npc entity kill the player you were shooting at  moments after they pop youthe km should show the ship you were in while dealing the damage  not your pod
yes  but careful design would be needed to remove the possibillity of it being used as a lag bomb weapon1 enemy fleet jumps into system2 10 stack split warriors issue command to split trit stack into 1000 piles3 server lags as it receives 10000 commands from the client to split stackscalculaitons may be done on the client  but the server still needs to process the split stack commands
yarr
you definitely have itand i agree let ccp bash their heads in over the exact implantrig bonuses i was just ing into the wind and seeing what came backps  they already have rigs  i want the sentry rigs to be changed to cover all combat drones dlol i just realized they have small sentry damage rigs thats great if youre flying an ishkur and want to drop that one sentry

for 35ths of the day the ingame help channel flows along perfectly fineits a mixed discussion of help queries game mechanics module ship and user interface helpthen isd gsilver comes onlinehe goes on the warpath and gags anyone who isnt doing qa oneline answers with zero discussionhelp is reduced people are locked in a cage and afraid to answer questionsgsilver takes over vomics ego ruins the channelat this stage most helpers leave
i second this im in help almost every day and seems nobody disrupts it more than gsilver he threatens muting for anybody that wants to explain a little more on the subject of the persons problem instead of just giving an answer on how to fix it its prompted me to just convo the people to help which takes away from everyone else i could be helping in the channel
i remember relying on that channel a great deal when i was starting out i also think i remember gsilver there too but it wasnt like you describe the channel does strike me as a somewhat stressful one to monitor over though if that job is left to a constant set of people i cant imagine anyone who wouldnt eventually snap maybe if ccp had all of their gms rotated through there they may currently do this i have no idea it would take the edge off the job
this thread is unlikely to remain unlocked for long ccp does not care for comments on its forums regarding ctritique of their staffyour best course of action is to petition against the gm in question using the section of the petitions reserved for just thatwindjammer
while i agree that the behaviour you describe seems crazy im not sure the csm is the right venue for it it just seems likely to cause more hostility than solutions if the csm goes to iceland and starts naming names that said i dont know what the right way is  i assume youve tried taking this directly to the fellow himself and hes been unreceptive if so try finding out whos in charge of isd and taking it to them be reasonable try not to disparage the fellow too seriouslyremember isd are unpaid volunteers and see if that gets you anywherebest of luck getting this solved  if the fellow does as you say it could seemingly use a solution but this seems the wrong approach
this is part of the problem complaining to gms about isd is like complaining to police about police or doctors about doctorsthus i come herethere is a problem and it does need a solution even if that is just a redirection of gsilvers effortswhen the help channel is shut down like this everyone is either gagged or leaves in disgust you notice this as suddenly no one is answering questions except for gsilver but then when he leaves 30mins later the helpers returnrookie help channel is one thing it need to run in a oneline qa formathowever for most of the day the help channel functions in a way very different to this with a higher level of service including more details and discussion on how mechanics actually work this is until gsilver gets online and ruins itthe help channel is being disrupted by this isds actions while gags and bans are being used in a frivolous manner
not really  like i said isd are volunteers not employees its not like theyre just working out of a different half of the gm centre theyre people who volunteer their time from home ive looked into this a bit more and theres a couple names you may want to contact isd libertina is the person in charge of starthe rookie help division of isd that gsilver works for and ccp ginger is the volunteer manager contact those two and see if they can help you or direct you to the person who can its a better approach for a problem of this type and it has the advantage of not taking several months to work through the system give that a shot see if it helps
ive petitioned against a pair of gms in the past ive only done it once but it did yield results action was taken if i can get that reaction countering the actions of a couple of gms who are actually paid staff then you can surely get action taken against a member of the isd which is comprised of volunteersso while it may be complaining to the police about police that doesnt mean you wont get a response youll like police have internal affairs departmentsyour issue sounds like youve found one volunteer whos on a small power trip and needs to be reined in that or removed from his position of authority this is not a situation for the csm to pursue the csm functions as a legislative lobby group rather this is a situation for the ccp police to take care of in other words they need to support their own standardsrules of behaviour and that means you start by petitioning against the guy within gameshould that fail there is always the old fashioned customer complaint department accessed through out of game emailwindjammer
the csm has no say about isdif you think a member of isd is doing his job poorly then you need to submit a petition in the isd category about it the csm isnt going to be able to help you
lordmagnus is the best magnusergo not supported it has been stated a thousand tiems a thousand times that wrecks belong to no oneeven if they did they would technically belong to the pirate faction that the ship once belonged to and therefor they are still fair game
beat me to itnot supported
110 for the troll attemptnot supported of course
first of all kill rights is a different mechanic from being aggroed towards someone if you steal their loot you dont get kill rights so why on earth would you get kill rights for salvaging wrecks the whole idea of which implies it belong to anyone anywayssecond of all if it did cause them to be aggressed towards you which is what i think you are asking for i hope it wouldnt make a lick of difference i ninja salvage occasionally if i see loot i want i take it meaning im busy sitting there agressed salvaging and looting away and most of the time im ignored or they blow wrecks or get scared and fly away its great funthe best is when they refit to pvp and i fly back in a phoon and they warp off again
i cannot support this assigning kill rights for theft is a bit over the top however if it was a proposal for flagging the salvage thief that would be another matterside note ccp controls the mechanics of the game and they decide what is to be allowed in the game this does not mean they have license to make unitlateral value judgements on what is wrong and what is right members of the ccp staff can say its not stealing all they want it does not change the fact that it is stealing there are a number of potential reasons for ccp to argue that ninja salvaging is not stealing and none of them have anything to do with the definition of theft save within the confines of their game mechanics in other words it is stealing but it is stealing that ccp currently chooses to allowwindjammerps the op is in error when he says there is nothing he can do if nothing else he can have fun blowing up the wrecks
ccp made no value judgment the rightness or wrongness wasnt remarked on legality was right and wrong are no where close to legal and illegalwhat ccp is really doing for the mission runners that cant deal with ninja salvagers is allowing them to keep their ships as soon as high sec mission runners can attack ninja salvagers we all know what would actually happen
supportedim sick of these greedy little wers whining about this deasd horse over and over like they dont already make more isk than their risk level deservesgive them what they want let them lose their ships to ppl who actually know how to fly and let the flood of tears commence
you realize you cant get the salvage without specialized equipment thats the crux of the issue thats why salvaging is a miniprofession as much as mining hacking and archeology you can run a radar site and kill all the rats but that doesnt mean the contents of the hacking can is yours by any kind of rightthe contents in the rat wreck itself is yours because regardless of your fitting if you killed that rat you can get that loot theres no exceptions all you need is space in your cargo holdand youre going to complain about ninjaminers who are stealing the asteroids in your missions too right
for this reason alone supported
the terms theft and stealing are not exclusive to the realm of law though law often attempts to define them in a contractual fashion when someone steals from another we identify it by whether the action in question was wrong or right the legal system strives to either emulate right or wrong or seeks to circumvent right and wrong thus the concept of theft cannot be left to definitions made by law in other words it is quite possible to steal even though the law will not punish it as suchso when ccp staff say ninja salvaging is not stealing they are making a value judgment it would be more accurate of them to say it is not illegal in eve and so no law has been broken that would be a comment on law rather than the one they do make which is comment on value as well as lawif you believe this to be true you should support the ops idea though i still think he phrased it incorrectly when he said kill rights im pretty sure he meant flagging similar to loot theftfinally you dont know what would happen what would happen is one of the reasons ccp does not want to flag ninja salvagers and why most ninja salvagers dont want to be flaggedwindjammer
and what if you didnt have enough room in your ship what if you had to go back to station to get another ship with sufficient cargo space not yours because you didnt have the cargo hold capacitythis also ignores mission ships that do have salvage equipment on them while doing a mission these guys are ninja salvaged all the time because they cant get to the wreck they created before a ninja pops in and steals ityes though that is a less common phenomena because of the time it takes to suck up the rock and the relatively low value of most rock found in missions the asteroids are literally created by the action of the mission runner and of course the term ninja miner most often refers to an entirely different type of activitywindjammer
the cargohold capacity is not keeping you from looting its simply keeping you from looting the entire mission at once again you dont need a special module to loot wrecks i can loot a wreck just as easily with no modules fitted whatsoever you can not however salvage with a naked ship this is because salvaging requires a tool that not everyone has once salvaging is builtin like the ships onboard scanner for example then we can argue about salvage belonging to youit doesnt ignore them at all they are free to salvage just as i am free to warp to a belt and mine that doesnt mean if im the first in the belt it belongs to me however hell even if i scan out a grav site the asteroids dont belong to me any more than they belong to the next guy who warps inits certainly an interesting pointofview but it is fairly obvious ccp doesnt agree with your right to anything in the mission activating your mission gate is not a criminal act killing your mission rats is not a criminal act mining your mission asteroids is not a criminal act this is not by accident this is a design decision made by ccp devs long long ago otherwise missions would be instanced and none of this would be an issue
 this hahahaha let us be flagged
oh look its this topic again for then fing bajillionth timesalvaging is a mini professionccp likes it that wayits not going awaygive up
just pop the wrecks wastes their time as much as yourswhat i am more concerned about is when you do get kill rights others in your fleet dont have aggression and this is becoming a problem because a pve fit ship has absolutely no way of successfully engaging a pvp fit ship  not only that but now you cant even get a buddy to help out and chase them off ridiculousperhaps its a badly thought out attempt at tweaking the aggression rules to try to get people to move out of high sec missioning hubs and into low sec which again other than the occasional onesided engagement with a bc gate camp is pretty much devoid of any activity whatsoever
hell with it drop salvage altogether no more salvage for anyoneits like a pack of damned kids all ing about who got the biggest piece of cake screw it no cake for any of you
get rid of concord protecting ninjasalvagers sitting in noobcorps and being invulnerable lets promote more pewpew
not supported
youre right it is stealing in a wayunfortunately for the op and mission runners it is stealing from the wreckage owner in the case of mission runners that would be serpentis etcso no the salvagers should not be flagged toward the mr in any way shape or form for salvaging a shipotoh they shouldnt really be flagged toward the mr for looting from the wrecks either just as in pvp the wreckage loot belongs to the owner of the ship
if you are not making enough isk running missions why dont you try ninja salvaging
your argument is selective and ignores what makes the loot the property of the mission runner in your argument a module the salvage module is what makes the loot the property of one person or the other this ignores the module which made the wreck in the first place turret launcher or bothif salvaging capability were built into the ships rather than requiring a module youd still argue in the same fashion basing your argument on a module or lack thereof is futilegetting to a belt first or scanning a site is not what created the site or the belt these things are created through no action of any player and because of that no single player has any claim to them the exception to this is whats going on in 00 because of the dominion release but that is an entirely different section of the game with its own unique dynamicsmission npcs are created by the action of the mission runner he goes to an agent requests a mission and accepts it further the mission runner creates the wrecks by shooting the npcs in just the same way heshe creates the loot in the wreck by that action this is the basis for the claim of ownership not who got to the loot or salvage firstthis is simply restating and agreeing with what ive already said in post 10 of this thread thank you for agreeing with me again stealing the salvage is not a criminal act but that does not mean it isnt stealing it simply means there is no law prohibiting the actthere was a time when killing an npc did not generate a wreck only a loot can and there was a time when stealing from that loot can was not a flagged offense ccp has a long history of devs changing what theyve made decisions on long long agoregardless of what is flagged or not flagged and even what concord responds to and what they do not respond to there is one thing everyone should be able to agree upon missions will never be a private little dungeon or as you say instanced that would take too much interaction out of the game and ccps overall design philosophy is interactionif stealing salvage were flagged in the same way that stealing loot is things would be much more interesting for mission runners and for ninja salvagers i really do not believe that ccp will do this in the foreseeable future they see ninja salvaging as a mini profession in other words a beginners profession by its very nature it is for those new to the game because it allows the beginner to gain income from something they can do with very little training flagging the theft would expose these beginners to getting their little rumps shot off that would discourage beginners and ccp wants to acquire beginners more money in ccps pocket that waywindjammer
i would have thought someone like you would be very much in favor of flagging gives you more opportunity to bait people into attacking you
by your line of reasoning the loot in the npc wreckage should not be flagged either as it too belongs to the npc serpentis in your example if that came to pass ninja stealing would become even more profitable the volume of bear tears would increase and missions would be nerfed perhaps this is something you should advocate
because a good mission runner has enough of his own wrecks to salvage theyre easier to find and heshe isnt a thief when they salvage them it may surprise you that some care about that last part but it is still truewindjammer
i dont think four posts in a row is enough try again
in order to plex in fw you give up free time that is often spent alone with a button and some npcs waste ammo blow standings with one of the 4 major empires and you are forced to fly somewhat pve ships what do you get minimal lp much less than you could get for a mission and maybe a medal is there any wonder that big fights over plexesoccupancy are rare i propose ccp makes plexingoccupancy valuable there are many potential ways to do it from lp to sov mechanics but the purpose of this thread is to just to see if players agree that fw plexing should yield more than it currently does please give your view andor discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal
sorry guy my research and that of my companions indicates that there is no change in the success rate of inventionthat having been said the time for removal of t2 bpos from the game has come with the release of dominion which is odd coming from me as not more than a year ago i would not have supported a removal of t2 bpos the key to my change of heart can be found in the sheer amount of material now needed for t2 productiondominions release greatly increased the volume of material needed to make a single t2 item this means that those well researched t2 bpos with their high mes are kicking the crap out of anybody that invents this on top of the existing advantages ie not having datacores as an overhead make the t2 bpo way overpowered and capable of taking over markets by undercutting those who must invent while still making a decent profitno way for inventors to compeat  severe imbalancewindjammer
atm there is nothing in a pos to repair your shipsi know there is a way to put shiprepping modules in your hangar but switching out is a painthe modulesone could either create a module thatreps al kinds of damage one at a time ex first hull then armor then shieldsone module with addons one for each rep typeor 3 seperate modules one for each rep typethese modules can either be seperate modules to put in the pos bubble but that might crowd itanother option is add build 1 allrep module or in the other case 3 seperate modules to your towerhow to use itoperating ranges for the module can depend on the size of the tower this to make it impossible to rep ships that are constantly moving in and out of the shield to attack and rep there should be a considerable distance covered from the shield to the max rep distance it could also be limited to battleship size max or the hitpoints repped could be decent for a bs but meaningless for capital shipsfor large towers the module can have a lock and operating range of 2000m unmannedor manned from 3 to 6 km depending on skillsit can only rep ships inside the pos and needs to be installed at close range from the pos toweror as mentioned above it could be an addon module for the pos towermentioned ranges can vary the ones mentioned are merely exampleswhen there is nobody in the pos that can man the module the pilot manipulates the module to rep his own ship he moves his ship within 2500m of the module and chooses rep my ship from the listwhen somebody wants to man it it works like the pos gunsskills can be added too the corporation skill lista basic inpos repping skill increasing the rep rangelvl 1 to be able to self rep unmannedlvl 4 needed to man it and rep other shipsalso needs anchoring 4 or 5an advanced skill increasing the rep amountneeds anchoring 5 and rep range 5depending on factors the devs may come up with it can be from 5 up to 10 per levelmy 2c
logistic ships carriers and nanite repair paste is all you needhaving a module like that would make it too easy to repair in hostile spacewhy would you fight over stations with repair service if you can just have the same on the pos for free also it would make living in wh space too easywh space is meant to be toughthat said  i cant really support it
fair enoughthere is not always somebody around that can fly a carrier logistics or anything else for that matter and you cant repair your shield armor hull with repair paste so you are doomed to go through the module switchingbest regardss
there is a reason i pack a cruiser for whs ops one fitted with various remote reppersits not an impossible feat and it doesnt need to be logisticsits called using your head 
this would be quite convenient but give it severe limitations like only one per pos and only able to rep one person at a time slowly also make it able to rep drones
ok you cant hear anything in space as there is no air to transmit soundso why am i bombarded with random garbled crap at every gateif thats what is on your ships radio wouldnt you change the stationnow this even occurs at mission acceleration gatesamarr station sounds are horriblei purposely find a nonamarr station for my ship spinning pleasureand i dont know if its just me but does it seem like just when they get the sound to a tolerable level they release a new patch and someone at ccp takes it upon themselves to jack the volume on station sounds and gates back up to a ridiculous leveli can count five times this has happenedjust give us volume control please dont care to hear broken garbled radio chatter
supported  and id also like to hear the sounds from my missions please guns go boomthensilent 
i support this and want to add that we really need an option to turn off positional sound effects so we finally can hear our turrets firing enemy lasers shooting ship explosions and all that again as it used to be preapocrypha
definitely
maybe its me but i can never seem to balance the eve voice output w the game sound so i can hear either way it needs adjusted as a standalone
this what an awful terrible idea
since the changes in dominion the prices of the hulk class mining barge have skyrocketed due to changes in construction requirements as well as mineral instability think ccp should revert the hulk bp to pre dominion stats at least untill ore prices stabalize mining has never been as profitable or as much of an isk sink as missioning and these changes have just made mining even less apealing in my opinion ccp owes miners alot but the least they can do is make a few small changes to the blueprints so that hulks are once again affordable and easier to produce
no
oh yes pleasecj
it would be nice if the search box on your hanger included the item type in its resultsfor example if i type drone into the search at the moment i get things like drone control unit i but no actual drones if the item group was included in the search then drone would still show the drone control unit i but would also include all actual drones in my hanger it also follows that i can then be more specific and search for combat drones or missile launcher etccant think of any down side really cj
theres an existing thread regarding this proposal here
poses were all good when people didnt rely on them as their homes people would erect poses in empire space or space where they have sovereignty in order to perform various functions but the owners would go to an outpost to dock up for the nightsince apocrypha introduced the element of wormhole space people have been finding and  and making homes of  these new uncharted unclaimed dangerous locations in unknown reaches of space the problem is these people cant rely on ccpgenerated outpost stations that they can dock in where they can take advantage of services  some differing between different stations some being basic functions that all stations have  to support their ships and inventory a lot of these things are covered by various objects that can be anchored inside a pos but a lot of these things arent and even the things that are available in poses sometimes dont work correctly or are just a major pain in the ass being somebody whose corp lives and operates in wormhole space i find it necessary to outline the various stupid things that we have to deal with due to the pos and ask that they be somehow resolved in a notunbalanced mannernew proposalsshield chargingone of the seeminglyfundamental problems with poses is that you never dock your ship while you are in it to explain further your skills are not realized as far as ship specifications until the ship is undocked and in space and then you board it i dont do armor tanking so i cant reliably say whether armor will fill up when you step into it but as for my buffertanked drake because my shield management skill and the various shield buffer modules and rigs are not taken into account until i board the ship the shield amount will remain what it was before the buffer was added it will usually be about 40 of total and i have to wait for it to charge before i can do anything i dont know the best way to resolve this problem perhaps the addition of repair modules for poses or maybe cut the shield recharge time and capacitor too by 13 while within the forcefieldpersonal hangarsi dont know if this is something i can ever expect to see but a personal division in corporate hangar arrays or maybe a new pos fitting thats specialized for providing a personal hangar to everybody would be fantastic its very hard to keep track of whats yours in a hangar array and its even harder when somebody thinks that pile of artillery is theirs when they accidentally left theirs in jita you go to pick up more ammo and then find that its gonedocked ship cargodrone accessfairly selfexplanatory id like to be able to access cargoholds of ships that are currently stored in the ship maintenance arrayproblemsships dont store properly in ship maintenance arraysometimes when you board a ship thats in the ship array the ship youre currently in will not store itself that is a big problem because you have to wait out the session timer so you can board the improperlystored ship wait out the session timer so you can store it and then wait out the session timer so you can board the ship you actually want to fly poses with more than a few modules are hard enough to get out of without vacant ships sitting aroundstarbase fuel technicians dont receive low fuel warningsselfexplanatory they really should receive thosethats about all i can think of off the top of my head feel free to add more dont forget to check the support this topic box even if you only support a couple points

of course they need fixing there are many many threads concerning the mattertry adding your wisdom to them rather than spreading the complaints far and wide to far less effect
ive already posted a thread about fixing these and so much more check it out here pos mechanics redesign and support it if you feel it deserves support
hell yeah having to wait 3 days until you can start properly planning a new char on a new account is just dumb
well they really could move the stuff away from the api stuff from the forum login i think it is just a bug to be honest
fair enough
before you post a new proposal check whether it has been brought up already 
please fix the broken parts firstability to control sound levels over and above having 1 slider to control all world soundsthen we can add more stuff which will be broken at some point functional or not
i think a better proposal would be automatic label assignment then we would normally get the option to remove the inbox label aswell
i know that for the malediction and vengeance making them more effective vs smaller faster targets and maybe tweaking the rof a bit higher while keeping them short range  though more than l smart bombs with decent skills  would fit their roles nicelywould allow the vengeance to sting a bit harder and protect itself better when in its role as heavy tackle plus be a bit more solo friendly the malediction would still tend to be tackle only but would be better able to protect itself from other inties and drones

for some reason none of the wiki links are working for me i am getting an ie cant display the web page
ive just tried the links from my post above with ie8 and it seems to work though opens them in a new window i normally use firefox and havent seen an issue with that the links also work from the pdf via firefoxall the topics should be under the csm fourth candidacy category does that link work for you
i know this one is supposed to be coming real soon tm but just in case it doesnt the ab boost was great but perhaps a little too fast
meh the dramiel does 18 kms with a t2 ab and an aflike buffer in that context ab afs doing 12  15 kms as they did with the 15level boost doesnt seem unreasonable to mev0v
heres me hoping theyll put some more effort in finding specific bonus for every individual af then the lets smack an ab bonus on better then nothing agreed but still far from good
do want afs havent lived up to what they should be in well forever also a second midslot on the retribution would be nice
supported
buff their base speeds to a little bit faster than theit t1 counterparts and give each ship a role defined 4th bonus like the afore mentioned tracking bonus
well the csm failed to find a solution to the hybrid weapon system problems this was mostly due to a poorly written wiki that linked to a third party website wich could be edited at any timeto that end im gonna throw together what should of been in the wiki herehybrid weapons are underpowered due to several factors to keep things simple ill seperate both problems into blasters and into railgunsblasters they suffer from very short range with only 10 more dps than pulse lasers which have 3x the range range should not be adjusted as this is a drawback of blasters  base damage of blasters must be increased to bring back the extreme close range advantage that blasters are supposed to have the old gallante saying of wait till i get in range no longer applies as it is laughed at by everyone saying i can kill you long before you get in range although off topic the set of blaster boats need to be revised but should be done with reference and balance to a blaster overhaul  whilst at the range they are supposed to excell at they suffer from poor tracking due to the tracking formula being too simple people say that this is a piloting problem however having to reduce your transversal to be able to hit means that you become an easier target too rendering using short range weapons to get under the guns of longer range weapons pointless an extension to the tracking problem is attempting get into that sweet spot which is extremely small less than 500m difference either way a boost to tracking however needs to be thoroughly balanced and tested to prevent megathron pilots being able to hit an af pilot a damage boost to overloading blasters has been suggested i like the idea but needs to be thoroughly looked into ammo types of blasters needs a revision not to change damage types thermkin is here to stay different ammo types should offer real advantages in different fields instead of mostly just different optimal rangerailguns railguns dont seem to have any identity they have horrifying tracking poor dps and only moderate range t2 ammo needs revision however is a separate topic any suggestions to railgun improvements because im struggling for good ideas that have reasonable advantages and drawbackshybrids in general have no real advantage over other weapons systems the prime evidence for this is the fact that people tend to be happy to fit unbonused weapons systems to ships over their bonused hybrid weapons systems laser ferox laser lachesis although it doesnt have a hybrid bonusprojectile myrmidon im sure there are morei would never personally fit hybrid weapons to ships that get a bonus to projectilelasers
supported  and the queueing repairing system
of course the question arises how much attention or priority minor suggestions get
you have such confidence that you are right and anybody who questions you is wrongso you admit your plan could have serious flaws and would end up causing problems tell me thiswhy should ccp implement this change knowing that it would cause overpowered ships and would ultimately need a completely new second adjustment to make up for the first changes flawsno im not that goddamn stupid you moron you dont lose 25 damage youre missing out on 25 damage because youre not using the bonus learn to use the ships bonuses and use the bonused ammo to get 25 bonus damagedid i make the bonus part clear enough i understand that your current argument is so that all ammos get the bonus but right now you are in no way losing damage youre not using the bonus therefore not reaping the benefits
i cant take this proposal seriously unless you suggest they fix the breacher hound purifier nemesis eris helios and all four titans too
breacher ok it should be fixed too eris same but the stealth bombers and titans arent those are special case as all races ships within the same class made get different dmg type bonusesoh and yes you loose the dmg bonus if you dont use kinetic missiles  no other race looses its bonus just by chaning ammowhat stupid idea tells you we dont use the bonus dropping bonus is always done by fitting like if i were using rocket on my cerb not by changing ammo it is just stupid i dont know how much would you whine if turret ships dmg bonuses only applied to 2 of 8 ammos they can use like you for matar you get dmg bonus for fusion and nuclear  oh you wouldnt use empphased plasma much then would you this is what kinetic only bonus does with caldari shipsoh and whats the reason behind that amarr missile ships get dmg bonus and not only em dmg bonusgypsio yeah that why i always use hmls over hams  never understood why ppl still posting ham fits those are crap in most situationsexcept in eft dps with rage loaded lol that is niche
i dont think theres anything the matter with hams or ham drakes and rage is far from niche  it does full damage to a webbed bc the choice of hams or hmls simply depends on your flying style expected opponents and if applicable gang composition
depends on if you are fling in eve or in eft thats all 
no i think hams look decent in eft as well
this thread is becoming too mired in mud flinging and technical balance debatelets get back to the very basic issueproposal 1 change the kin damage bonus on cmbs to a rainbow damage or rof bonus2 nerf them in some other way where necessary to keep them balanced3 4 profit maybe an alteration to the characteristics of missiles themselves rather than the shipst
tyson that doesnt resolve the fact that the kinetic bonus isnt the problem with caldari ships the problem is individual ships being to weakly designed whether it be pg cpu shield buffer or lolkets or whatever else
like poorly designed bonuses for example kinetic only dmg
nope pout of interest do you think the current rof bonus on the naglfar is good or would an explosive damage bonus or a blanket missile damage bonus be better the answer is non of them the ship is poorly designed split weapons ftl and no amount of changes will compensate for this without making the naglfar woefully overpoweredor woefully underpowered like it is now and was for several years
naglfar is much better than the phoenix  and firstly because of kinetic only bonus so yes i think rof bonus is much more viable than explosive dmg bonus

care to comment on mini ammo  which is damage type based  rather than on range based amarr ammo

25 blah blah blahno we dontat level 5 whatever dps a ship has with its fit is its base unmodified damage at level 4 whatever dps a ship has with its fit is its base unmodified damageat level 3 etci hope you get the pointalso as an aside the fact that caldari use missile launchers does not mean that missile launchers are caldari they are a universal weapons delivery system the caldari flavour of which is kin the matar flavour of which is exp and so on and so forthmissile boats have problems but those problems are nothing to do with its bonus allocation they are to do with the style of damage delivery ie that it is not instant and that the actual statistics a ship has in terms of its fitting capabilities are not optimal for the role it is supposed to takearguing that because some theoretical numbers outside of eve appear unfair means a race needs a blanket boost in eve when there is already balance with some of the problem ships of that race is illogical and a ham fisted poorly thought out and frankly immature attempt at fixing something that isnt the problem posting the same biased argument over and over without modification speaks more of the authors your fixation on a supposed problem than to the existence of the problem itself the drake is fine the cerb is fine the other ships with these bonuses might have problems that resulted from unrelated issues including powergrid cpu slot layout and rediculously nerfed weaponry rocketssee now im being serious for you
where did i say i think that  i am a missile user im fully aware of thisguns do sub optimal damage at large portions of their range range adversely affects dmgmissiles do full damage across their entire range range does not adversely affect dmgguns hitmiss their target depending on angular velocitysig radius of target missiles do moreless damage depending on explosion velocitysig radius of targetso in the range game missiles win and in the sig radius game both guns and missiles have a downsidethe reason i pointed to the range issue with minnies is because as ccp have said before minmatar fight in falloff in other words minmatar fight at sub optimal dps perhaps not all the time but enough to justify having the switchable damage while not 100 exclusive to minmatar the sheer prevalence of split read unbonused weapons in minmatar hulls is yet more weight behind my pointi agree some caldari hulls need some help but a blanket approach is not the answer a fact sadly lost on ccp when they looked at minmatar recently youll notice that people are not flying significantly more cyclones and bellicoses now they are still mostly flying ruptures and hurricanes albeit a few more of them sporting artilleryyour proposed change would have much the same affect in short it would do little to encourage pppl to fly currently underused caldari hulls and merely reinforce the dominance of hulls such as the drake and the cerb

i disagree gallante primary weapons are hybrids with secondary drones in support most gallante ships get bonuses towards hybrids not drones some ships do get a primary bonus to drones but the majority use hybrids as the primary
supported
maybebut if they got drones for frigates it will be at expense of cargohold capacity firstand then if you redraw the missile launchers slot to make them hybrid gallente will never have to skill missile but they couldnt use counter missile well i dont matter i dont fly gallente but you cant have a 20 more damage without a lack elsewere no

as a matter of fact has anyone tried flying directly towards a planet on mwd sufficiently long  no well here is what happens the planet turns out to be just an empty sphere and once you reach it it turns inside out and you continue flying inwards but you dont see a planet in front of you but rather an empty space

you can add stars to this list of inconsistencies as well im not going to go into the likelihood of different star types or the utter lack of multistar systems in eve the logical side of my brain freaks out when i look at some of the classes and diameters of the stars let alone that they would have planets orbiting them i seem to recall jita originally being a blue main sequence shown in description  silly improbability of having planets as well as being horribly huge and unstable stars  but attributes they changed them show an f1v unfortunately they also show the stars diameter  04 solar radii  which makes everything terribly improbable again not to mention the star is very blue still not just the sizetemp comparison but all the planets orbiting something that size
its a minor point but i cant think of anything it could possibly break so supported
so let me see if i understand your position correctly you posit that in the status quo field command ships are usable and effective to the point where you make pvp videos with the one that basically everyone but you regards as the worst of the four and still manage a good amount of success you simultaneously claim that field command ships have inadequate bonuses and need to be made into elite gangboost ships with bonuses that no other ship class  including the ones specifically designed for the purposes of boosting fleets  can touch your rationale for this looking at the thread linked in the op seems to consist entirely of the fact that they have the word command in their name you proceed to make incoherent references to tier2 battlecruisers saying that the astarte is supposed to be a myrmidon variant and talk about how ccp needs to either give them an incoherent and overly complex bonus that you made up with no regard for game design or balance or they need to acknowledge that they are assault battlecruisers which is exactly what they have been for the last five years and which is a role that they are spectacularly wellsuited for do i have that right
they are usable and effective but they are to be even more usable and even more effective youve got this right i suppose btw i guess i can make a movie featuring almost any ship but this wont make the ship itself become any better than it is i guess i could fly tech1 battlecruisers but that would be extremely lowrisk and thus boring you cant claim something is fine ie field cs just by the fact someone likes to use itplease dont pull statements out of the thin air as i have never said anything of astarte as myrmidons variationacknowledging command ships as assault battlecruisers requires you to take a closer look at the entire tech1tech2 classes thats right too in some cases  as stated  the difference is not distinctive enough again as stated this difference became dim with the introduction of tier2 battlecruisers marauders and black ops field command ships were wellsuited for their intended role i want them to recover their former majesty balance shifts happen now and then and we should respond to thosebut a sheer tank and spank assault class is pretty boring itself thats why i proposed something unique
no1 command ships role is that of sustained gang boosters changing the bonus to a short them even if larger boost will greatly degrade the value in fleet operations 2 a short therm boost will make the shield capacity gang link totally useless
1 thats exactly why its a good proposal blobs dont need any boosting smallscale pvp needs it fleets still could use fleet command ships so whats the problem here2 wtb one
oh of course they could be the question is whether thats actually the right call for game balance or whether youre just trying to buff the ship you fly true but youre also in this thread saying that its a very good ship which makes me think that the movie was about more than just taking a littleused ship and having fun with it i oversimplified a bit but in your other thread you talked about how the only reason people dont hate the astarte is that the myrm is a drone ship that implies that someone might possibly have some reason to compare the two by default which is just ludicrous the eos is the myrmlike the astarte is the brutixlike other than for deciding which you want to fly there is no conceivable reason to even suggest that they should be compared itd be like me saying that the only reason the drake looks good is because the erebus does something completely different i suppose i wouldnt directly be comparing them but it certainly begs the question of why youre raising even the possibility of comparison buffertank mwd fits t2 gear and t1 rigs allv skillsharbinger 678 dps 63k ehp 896 msabsolution 786 dps 105k ehp 922 msdrake 414 dps 92k ehp 1038 msnighthawk 572 dps 88k ehp 1038 msnote both these are heavy missile fits so theyre not especially comparable to the other three racesbrutix 743 dps 52k ehp 924 msastarte 938 dps 74k ehp 941 mshurricane 733 dps 45k ehp 1161 mssleipnir 837 dps 60k ehp 1475 ms gang linkyou were saying i dont find afs hacs bcs field commands or bses to be boring classes theyre less wacky than a stealth bomber but really most classes are built around a particular role whether that role is dps rr ew gang boosts or whatever else the four t2 cruiser classes are all very different but i dont consider one to be more or less interesting than the other three  they all have a role theyre all good at their role and their roles all fit nicely into broader issues of game design every mmo needs a few dps classes  they may be boring but theyre fine overall i think youre falling into the trap of assuming that interesting game design is inherently good game design your goal shouldnt be wacky stuff your goal should be elegant design what youve proposed is an ugly unnecessary kludge that destroys a perfectly good ship class yes its a bit more interesting but its far worse for the game step back and look at the big picture

gms first need to agree on what is and isnt an exploit their knowledge on the matter is as patchy as a ten year old pair of jeanssupported though the list should be formatted to make sure it isnt a howto page as in a list of the endresults of exploits recognisable by the normal player rather than doing this and this like that is an exploit that information needs to be kept internal
this is downright stupid you cannot bad punish for a law that isnt public if it is a punishable offense it needs to be clearly stated somewhere that it is such we have laws that state that stealing and murder is illegal if someone does read the law and go thats cool im gonna try it their is a jail system in place we do not or at least should not in most states have hidden laws that next law a businessmen find himself a jail for a market manipulation that offends the society and harms the economic system if its bannable offence their needs to be a clear definition of it and preferably a list people have given above a large number of examples someone kept saying htat buying ships insuring them and poping them for 2 mill of insurance money is a bannable offense hteir are tons of examples it needs to be made clear
i support thisa list of exploits doesnt necessarily need to be exhaustive but some better guidelines as to what players should report would be very helpfuli think the danger of more people performing exploits is actually fairly minimal  you dont need to specify every detail of an exploit in the list as stated already and if people do start or carry on with exploits when theyre in the list id say thats an even more clearcut case for a warningban
i offer this up is there a list of exploitspos bowling  for the majority of the time the mechanics of the game allowed this to happen gms had differing opinions on whether or not it was an exploit then they all agreed it was legal because they couldnt police it when they eventually all agreed it was an exploit the devs fixed it in a patch a month later so this exploit list would have existed for a month in that caseif pos bowling is your example of what you think needs to be fixed then what you want is not allowing gms to make judgment calls on exploits besides as far as i know gms only issued warnings so this is a bad examplei recall another exploit where warnings were passed out second warning got you a temp ban that was later fixed  agressing someone with an alt ejecting from that ship jumping into it with you main then jumping the main character back into his normal ship this would lead to a bug where the person you had aggressed would see your main as blinking like they had rights to shoot but he wasnt this too was fixed shortly after warnings started being dished outas far as i know such ongoing exploits which are known but not fixed yet are very rare so this exploit list you ask for would normally have nothing on it other than afk macrosmost exploit warningspenalties were dished out after the fix and those have been for things very very clearly an exploit with the exception of the two i just listedshort and simple is gms give a warning first for most simple things huge things usually lead to emergency patches once devsgms learn about them the only exception to this rule is afk macros
absolutely not supportedi understand where the op is coming frombut cant you guys all envision the massive increase in exploiting that would occur if ccp ever did publish such a list this will never happen the request is ridiculous

good day allez version for the massesmissions after you clear a room of all enemies you become able to bookmark that space to come back later without passing all gates again scanning and gating mechanics remain otherwise unchanged alternatively and for the love of god only as an alternative as in if not bookmarks allow micro warp drivesgraphics add 2d graphics like sparks shells shield and armor and hull impacts these would be client side and toggleablegreatscroll down for the complete versionhonorable council of stellar management fellow capsuleers i wanted to write about some issues but first id like to make a brief introductioni like eve online very much and have played it for almost 2 years with as many as three accountsmy main activity is running missions because its the aspect of the game that i enjoy above the othersi have invited several friends who play online games regularly but for hard that i tried i wasnt able to make any of them stick to eve after their trials the main causes of this and the reason for this proposal are the following acceleration gates and bookmarks simply put during a mission if you bookmark anywhere in the deadspace you will not be able to warp back in if you leave the mission when you go to work or simply log off for whatever other reason if you try to warp to said bookmark youll end up at the first mission gate this is annoying and unnecessaryplease note that same spot will be automatically and magically accessible once you complete the mission micro warp drives simply put the majority of the missions in which you need speed because of travel times number of enemies etc you wont be allowed to use mwds annoying and unnecessary graphical flair poor combat impact effects simply put the fact that all weapons hit the same mysterious inner middle spot in every ship is a turnoff for some of the people i showed the game tobecause of the above i respectfully propose that our kind people at ccp allow warpin to an acceleration gate mission spot for example only after said spot has been cleared of enemies theres ample proof that mission running people would accept this regardless of space security to avoid the annoying and boring waiting and travel times connected with the current acceleration gate logics allow the use of mwds in mission deadspace this will for example open up many new ways to play missions after not much in fact youll end up playing the same ones so itll add variety enrich fights graphics with 2d detail ricochet and particles to the fights for example regarding detail projectile weapons would litter the space with used shells hybrids would release casings missiles would release flying guides and lasers would leave dust coulds behindregarding ricochet hits should be absorbed with some graphical effect to the extent that the very projectile 2d figure might stay floating around the ship or that the shield and armor and hull might display a little focused explosion or similar effectregarding particles at the moment only missile explosions produce some kind of particles upon hit itd be surely nice to see similar effects applied to other weapon typesi believe that all players will benefit from these additions that enrich gameplay and user experiencethanks for your time
done intentionally for multiple reasons it slows down the amount of income generated in the mission mission running is the most profitable profession in the game and making it better would further damage an economy dominated by components and materials gathered by mission runnersagain done intentionally for the same reason as aboveit would be nice to have this fixed and also have missiles not spout from the core of the ship so i cant disagree i am not a programmer or developer but making both of these a client side function would seem relatively simple imho
yes
for all the hostility towards this topic theres really only 3 outcomes1 ccp leaves it alone doing nothing2 ccp makes sm med lg xl cap t1 named t2 faction officer complex3 ccp takes the small off the front and the i off the end and calls them tractor beam or capital tractor beam
or a strategic cruiser
well we got a salvager ii already why not a tractor beam ii as well 30km range something in between capital and small tech1
needs the details to be tight to avoid scamming and of course the risk vs reward needs to be balanced but in general i like this
what happens if someone wants to put a bounty on ppl who shoot at a pos the owning corpalliance should have some means to facilitate a bounty contract on ppl killing the poswhen does the bounty hunter get back the collateral after one succesfull kill or after the whole bounty amount is claimedthis will complicate things and slow down the flow of businessso with high enough skills a hunter can have multiple live contracts on a single target and claim a multiplicative amount after each killso one character gets killed a few times and puts up bounty contracts if there is enough collateral in then the target just docks up for one week and they keep the collateralgreat isk sink the money is taken from the bounty contract instead of the insurance corp ccp will love the idea to withdraw isk from circulation so the 10mil one pays to setup a contract is out of economy in that instance except if there is a pod kill but with the fixed 10mil amount you will dry it on the ship kill on almost anything bigger then a cruisergood idea the details require some work
heh yeah it does fix the abuse of the current systems quite well and it doesnt include complete denial of insurance to those under a bounty as some embittered carebears have been touting around this forum the last few days so sure from this perspective i could support itis anyone actually going to take it up  well if their motivation is isk certainly not a week spent hunting the same guy to get a few cruisers worth of bounty is a very very poor rate of return on the effort put in let alone the risk so i would say almost nobody would do it for financial gain if concord sanctioned targets is the motivation wardecks are more efficient by a very very wide marginin short great solution to the mechanic abuse but no nobody is actually going to do itshrug
supported with adjustment  and surely that adjustment always comes when it reaches serious discussion and development stageregardless bounty hunting in eve can add so much more to the community if done right currently its a joke this should be brought to the csmccp table for further refinement discussion and i support this wholeheartedly
i think the major difference is that drones are meant as a secondary weapon system  every primary weapon system uses a high slot drone boats emphasize this more than others and i think that they could do with a boost but i think that it is never going to happenmainly due to mission runners somebody can easily fit a decent domi tank pull all aggro and afk to the next acceleration gate while the drones do the dirty work repeat and rinse thats afk money and amounts to the same effect as macro miningit is bad at the moment but being able to increase the afk damage you can do would only worsen the amount of people doing itand as a side noteyou have been using a neut domi and amarr ship as examples but in a straight out fight dps abaddon vs neut domi the neut domi would win more often than not as the abaddons only hope is outdpsing your tank just before his cap runs outbecause of your free highsdont get me wrongim in full support of this but realistically i dont think the devs will allow it without some other major changes to drones ie removing the aggresive setting which would require a major patch and probably a complete overhaul which i doubt will take priority over what they consider more important issues in the game
one argument is how people say drones dont take up powergrid they dont take high slots etc but their damage is fixed dps from 5 heavy drones in a dominix is about half of what some other systems can easily achieve i dont see it as overpowered to give them a module or implants or rigs that increase this a little bit keep in mind these will all stack together just as any other damage modules and rigs not op justifiedyour amarr ship vs neut dommi is a very very close minded approach to this ships that are buffer fit and use almost no cap will have almmost no hinderance from the neuts and would slaughter the dommi you have to look at the wider picture just because a neut dommi is good at killing a cap intensive ship doesnt mean its overpowered

personally when i did i missioned in caldari space where the bounties are higher and the loot and salvage is abysmalso if you want to spend the time to scan me down and salvage andor loot the wrecks that i am leaving anyway for at most 14 of what i am earning more power to you i understand that theres a certain feel of ownership but you may also have that feeling over your ship and if other people choose to take that from you you wont have that either
ninja salvagers annoy me but i understand that this is a valid game mechanic and is how the dev team want it to bei dont mission in busy sites so i dont tend to get bugged by ninja salvagers but when i do i just pop the wrecksits pretty funny watching them race to the wreck and then me launching a missile just as they get therecomedysauce d
stealing salvage does flag the thief with an agro counternow if i could just figure out why you jetcanned your salvage
i challenge you to find strong evidence support that assertion that isnt some cherrypicked bs parroted ad nauseam from tabloids and as for the rest of the post it actually made my head hurt from the backwards logic contained thereinon how to fix insurance  well adjusting the payout so its never more than the cost of the hull would be a good start how often do you get more than the value of your car after totalling it in an accident
supported all areas and ways of living in the game should have some risk currently there is none in suicidegankingeasiest fix that i can see would be removing insurance payouts for concordkilled ships another options might be serious hitpoint buffs to hauler ships or nerfs to typical suicideganking ships but those are bad since they would have way more balancing issues and effects on the game also it would not to fix the core problem with suicide ganking even if you fail at it youll lose almost nothing while if you succeed you win everything and the losing side has no practical ways to defend himself or fight backa complete overhaul of the insurance system would be better of course but i dont see it happening in the near future
ill support this if we are allowed to have a realistic chance to evade concord and fight back since irl we dont have pwn police also one status hit for that 15 min timer since were being realistic and all oh and realistoc response to i mean cant have insta spawn on blinky can we
absolutely and since were being realistic how about concord locks the high sec jump gates against people with  50 security status since the empires dont want galactic criminals in their spacei mean since were being realiztic and allsee i can play that game too
i have to say its ridiculous when a guy can throw away a battleship and lose only a few million isk a decent compromise would be that insurance is removed but you could still get the 40 default payout this would reduce the shock of going from losing only a few mil to losing the entire cost of the ship im all for suicide ganking but i think its too easy as it stands
if it ceased to be an exploit to evade concord rr bs fleets would rule high secto the person who thinks locking a gate would prevent this you are horribly mistaken an rr bb fleet could stay in jita indefinitelyinsurance needs an overhaul however you are asking for yet another nerf to suicide ganks which already require pretty specific target selection  the dramatic loss of standing means people would be wasting standing hitting something useless
here again you have to be with 21 with the remote reps and the ship that needs repairingthe idea is to have an installation that is dedicated to repping so you can do it alone without having to drag shipmodules back and forth for the internal reppersin combat situations ships can then be repped inside the pos and go back out to fight faster then they can nowand i also do agree that there need to be limitations
being that remote hull rep is a right nigh unused pain in the backside it would certainly be handy to have a support facility like this oneitd also encourage folks to continue residing in wh space admittedly whether thats a plus or a minus is a moot point though
i like this though it will need to be balanced by requiring minerals andor only capable of repairing structure damage load up its bay with a proportion of minerals or perhaps a new commodity item nanite repair blocks anyone narbs and itll get to work on your ship for you
why not have a module tha consumes minerals in order to repair ships and modules ofcource you can bring a bunch of remotereps with logistics but i cannot see any reason why having a pos module like this that makes life easier would be a bad thing
although i was indeed courteous enough to read the rest i could have easily stopped hereyoure in a pos anchor a ship maint array and swap modules if youre hurting while youre inside the shield you dont need that dcu or that webber so swap those out for armor and hull reppers and let them mend while those are working your shields are naturally regenerating on their own toowhen its all fixed swap back out again and go about your businessotherwise what youre asking for will only receive the same criticism that station hugging does todayfight fight fight duck under the shield inside the station run the repper pay a repair bill then head back out for more pewpewjust use the ship modules there are a great many things ccp needs to add to the game but lazy mans reppers are not among them
i would suggest a repair bay addition to the sma that works like an sma but repairs any ship and drones  sentries  fighters  fighter bombers put inside over time this would use a varient of repair paste thus local reps can still be used for fast repairs if the paste is made player makeable from bpos sold on the market then it provides another consumable resource

if you are new you will not even have the icon space on the overview most possibly it is pityfully easy to miss this important actionitd be good to have a specific separate area for a my ship effects overlay where you see real time data likedamage being dealt effects being dealt shield net recharge repair net value for example
its kind of hard to see on my overview i am not sure but i think you might be able to set up your overview so the background of people using ewar on you is changed so you can set it so that people scrambling you have a purple background if you cant do that it would be nice if you could that way you could quickly figure out who to get away from if you want to gtfo

the sound engine is in even more dire need of reworking than the ui especially with channel management i have a 32channel sound card bought especially to make sound in games just a little better and its getting utterly swamped by two or three sound effects from eve i can go through combat and never hear any weapons firing at all then theres the issue of background sounds getting stuck and looping constantly until the client is restarted on top of that even though ive got 51 surround sound mapped as in the sound from the extra speakers is mixed back to just two with some environment modifiers to headphones eve seems to be trying to use speakers i dont have positional sound bypassing system drivers maybeits a real stretch to think that ccp have been working on this for about six years rant

after seeing some of the game play that goes on why not make the insurance system alittle more like real life ie if a pilot loses his ship to concord why should he get payed for it if you got out and wreak you car or what ever will commiting a crime you dont get paied for it so i think it should work the same way in eve
this has been brought up about a hundred times before you have basically invited yourself for public ridicule in what amounts to the eve town squarewhile i personally support the idea of removing insurance for both concord involvement and selfdestruction there are numerouns threads on the topic in the assembly hall and your support would be better served bumping one of those than by starting a new onefor example this one another thread on the topic
one of the major perks to eve imo is that there is no ranking system levels your judged on your capability to do a job and tbh i dont need certificates and ranks to say that i can cause some people with those prereqs still suck at what there rank claims they can doin the end experience speaks loudly over rankbad idea

from what i heard the construction requirements were changed but if it is somthing else effecting all tii ships than i fully support fixing tii construction as a whole lock this topic please
corian is on the right track actuallythree things are going on that explain the pricefirst the building requirements were changed to be appropriatetwo the new bottleneck of appropriate moon minerals were not widely mined before the change as such the supply is not currently as large as it can grow thus it will take a few months for the infrastructure to establish itself and prices to regulatethree hulkagedon is currently going on and as such the speculators who play the market are having a bit of fun
maybe it has nothing to do with it being easier for new players to obtain but rather something they decided should be easier to obtain for everyone not just new players its called balancing game dynamics has absolutely nothing to do with older or newer players and btw that skill your complaining about having taken to lv5 still has a benefit to you for being lv5 if the old requirement had you taking battleship construction to lv5 which is useless past lv1 iirc then i would completely agree with you that you got shafted but energy management 5 gives you benefits and to the other guy complaining about survey 5 so does it

not the blasters are the problem lasers and scorch are reduce laser dmg and nerf scorch range  problem solved
i disagree lasers seem to work very well and scorch is one of the only t2 ammos that actually work properly
all hail this idea
its pretty logical and if you use drones extensively you easily understand that this is important and necessary
id even add that dedicated drone boats dominix ishtar iskur etc should have some kind of limited drone repair ability as well
tldr make it a passive regen while docked no reason a cap ship cannot repair its own drones it makes no sense in game or in life that a ship like that would be unable to rep its own drones considering the chance of long term deploymwnt and prolonged engagments in 00
dav you completely dismissed 910 of my argument and focused on a little snip of my argument which really doesnt even have to do with this topic that kinda tells me you have nothing to say to my real argumentso much for proving me wrong allll the time i said why should ccp make this change knowing that it would cause unbalance in just as many ships as it would balance they should never make a change knowing that it will cause unbalance and that more changes would be neededyou kinda ignored that and then just made a list of some stupid damage thing that everybody knows and it really pointlessedit you said missiles do mediocre damage at their rangeif i recall missiles actually have the potential to do some pretty impressive damage numbers
no i picked up on the last point you made  because you had ignored the fact that all other ammos in game get 25 damage bonusesthe other 2 parts to your post was some argument you were having with someone else and looked a long way off topicyou are assuming that ships would become unbalanced there no evidence for thatif your refereing to drake then id have to say so what  caldari have one ship thats best in class omfg its the end of the worldits not like other races dont have there uber shipsvaga thrasher sabre rupturemega taranisrevelationaccording to what you have said in other post you dont even use missiles in pvpso you have a bad case of eft maxnumberitis imo
an argument that one blanket fix did not work is not an argument for saying caldari must be stuck with poor bonuses for ever moreiirc the amarr fix was a blanket fix  10em from all armor  10exp from all shields and that workedin fact by your definition any change made to the game that affects all ships is therefore a blanket fix and shouldnt be allowed so what are you saying that from now on only individual ships can have there stats tweeked and no other issues may be looked at everything you say about missilegun combat is largelly correct and i never meant to imply you dont understand  just that you were looking at pros and cons without stating all pros and consthe only point in your post i take acception to is this bitso in the range game missiles winthis assumes that a gun user cant maintain his optimalif so and he loses then he lost because he ship design was not good enoughmissiles only win at the range game if they can stay out of the optimal of gun users when fighting themconsider thislets assume that a ship x a cmb is balanced against ship y a gunboat at player lvl1they are balanced after taking into consideration all aspect of eve combattrackingfalloffgun power versus missile power sig radius speed  whatever other variable you want to throw into the mixnow if ship x has a damage bonus and that bonus is worth 16 dps per leveland ship y has a damage bonus and that bonus is worth 5 dps per levelthe cmbs fall behind in the balance stacks  it is inevitablethe only way to bring balance is for damaged bonused ship to have bonuses of equal valueit is the bonus  kinetic 5  a poor bonus that makes balancing cmbs impossible at all player levelsno amount of individual tweaks can fit thatfor a kinetic only bonus to be equivelent in value to a 5 dpl or rof bonus it would need to be set at a level that when avergared out over all possible encounters would equal a ship with 25 more firepoweri can only guess at what that level would be lets say its 10 per level more kineticif its that high then mini t2 and armor tankers would be screwed facing caldari mbsthe only option to improve the bonus and balance cmbs that doesnt throw the game into total fail  is to use the same type of bonuses that guns geta 5 per level to launcher rof is equal in bonus effectivness to a 5 per level gun rof bonusif cmbs are balanced versus gunboats then 20 by player level 5 for each boat means they remain balanced
what can i say stil the quality of my opposition just gives me so much encouragementa is straightforward enough youre appallingly exaggerating the potential threat of imbalance you seem to think that if ccp decided to treat caldari the same way they treat all the other races the entire game would come crashing down in a screaming heap of imba as the missile users would blow the very stars out of the sky this is a load of crap and you know itb only covers the maybe 1 or 2 ships that might be overpowered as a result of this like the drake if they get overpowered because of this then either fix them again which is not an unreasonable request balance is always an ongoing process or put up with it jesus its not like eve has never seen an overpowered ship before coughvagabondcoughok ok i stand corrected you really are that stupid thenchoosing not to use the bonus is like choosing to fit autocannons on an omen theyre wonderful weapons on a stabber but thats because a stabber is bonussed for them if youre not going to use kinetic missiles in a caracal then the launchers might as well be on a cyclone ok you get extra range but range was never the issue here
allow me to explain for the uneducated and terminally thickamarr pulsebeam setupslvl 5 pilot chooses radio does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses microwave does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses infrared does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses standard does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses ultra violet does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses xray does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses gamma does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses multifrequency does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserslvl 5 pilot chooses t2 does only emtherm damage which is fine because theyre laserscaldari missile boat setupslvl 5 pilot chooses kinetic ammo does pure kinetic damage which is fine because theyre missileslvl 5 pilot chooses thermal ammo does pure thermal damage which is fine because theyre missiles except theyre unbonussed which is bulllvl 5 pilot chooses em ammo does pure em damage which is fine because theyre missiles except theyre unbonussed which is bulllvl 5 pilot chooses exp ammo does pure explosive damage which is fine because theyre missiles except theyre unbonussed which is bullget it now or do i need to use words of 2 syllables or lessor let me put it this waycaldari dont complain that they have their ships have the weakest armour in the game unlike the amarrcaldari dont complain that their ships have the worst drone bays in the game unlike the gallentecaldari dont complain that their ships are the slowest in the game unlike the minmatarbut all of a sudden amarr and gallente are complaining that they cant choose their damage types unlike caldaribut caldari cant even choose their damage types without forfeiting their ship bonuses so why are you complainingconclusion stop using the selectable damage type is enough of a bonus argument it makes you look incredibly stupid
dav i apologize i didnt notice im arguing against 2 different people here and actually i havent opened eft once for this thread about missile ships i just know that dps figures from missiles in eft and in game are very comparable to turrets as one would say balancedarcane i really dont know what to say and if youre comparing ships like amarr gets most armor gallente get most drones and minmatar gets best speed then the obvious choice is caldari get best shields you cant all of a sudden switch an argument about tanking gallente have best active armor i guess but it sucks and drones to something about damage type caldari have best shields which the other races dont get i dont know how else to put it other than you admitted that this change could cause some caldari ships to become overpowered it is not well thought out you can throw all the numbers at me about damage per level crap but plain and simple most missile boats work and if there is a problem its usually not the kinetic damage part
true this will not fix caldari ships in general it will not in fact turn them into pure win machines all it will do is give bonus to damage based on the weapon fitted rather than a specific ammo typet
a lot of this debate seems to be focused now on the relative characteristics of the different weapons systems when really the matter is the nature of ship bonusesimagine the rage if the typhoon only gave its rof bonus to explosive missilesimagine if its projectile damage bonus only applied to depleted uraniumof course if you were to complain about this then you might be told learn to fly the ship n00b just fit whatever ammo works best for the fight and dont worry at all if you dont get any hull bonus for loading iti doubt minmatar pilots would be happy they would point out that amarr and gallente ships seem to get their damagerof bonus regardless of ammo typesimilarly if amarr ships only got their bonuses to standard crystals im sure thered be several people on this forum telling them to just fight within that range spec if you need better range then just use different ammo of course you wont get a ship bonus but if you use the close range stuff the better ammo strength will partly counteract that rightt
mate you need to calm down
rof thing is a bad analogy because one cannot make a gun or missile launcher fire faster simply be switching ammo types also to my understanding caldari using nonkinetic missiles is more the equivalent of matari fitting hybrids or lasers this is because missiles come in different racial flavours emamarr expmatar kincaldari and thermgalente tell me why a ship would get a bonus to a foreign weapon system and then we can start arguing all gunboats should have all possible gun fitting bonused i like the idea of a pulsabond myself
easiest solution make caldari unable to shoot anything but their bonused p kinetic missiles
yes this would help a lot same for amarr they should be able to only load their kinetic crystals
while there can be arguments made about the exact form of change lets face it ccp will take the subject listen with half an ear to the rest and proceedso heck yes the destroyers need to destroy not simply annoy to that end they should be glass cannons not glass slingshotsccp make it so how you do it surprise us
gallente are fine not supported its not like you dont see gallente ships there is always going to be something at the bottom of the food chain take your turn
were taking our turn which means its about time to start whining so we get buffed in maybe 1 or 2 years in case you didnt notice those on bottom get buffedwhich is why were asking for a buffyoure really smart you know that
gallente are finei see a ton of gallente ships in both 00 and empire there may be a few ships that could benefit from some minor revisions but to suggest anything more is simply unnecessary
predominion i kept seeing a tonne of minmatar ships too  where they fine as well its a fallacy to assume just because people train and fly a races ships that it must be because they perform fine some people might train a ship because they already have years worth of sp put into that faction some people may fly a ship for aesthetic concerns but to claim that people fly these ships so there must be nothing wrong with them is nothing short of forum trolling

the reason to compare myrm to astarte is quite simple they are of the same size unlike drake and erebus people usually compare ships by size ie battleships to marauders have you seen those endless omg navy apoc vs paladin  which should i pick rants over the forums thats it  surely you cant compare them directly like nh and drake but if you could youd likely end up with the same conclusion as when comparing caldari boats  that the tech2 ship is lacking some stats for its cost just a little bit but the shortage is there i dont really care for the exact numbers youve given but could you please try making similar sheets for tech1 cruisers vs hacs and tech1 bs vs maraudersblack ops comparisons taking into consideration some other statsfeatures like extra locking rangecargooverheatingjump drivetractor bonus etc ive already done those in my mind and the integrated results are written in the scalability paragraphs of the linked thread the difference in those combined stats is bigger for hacs and for tech2 battleshipsthats something like this tech1tech2 integrated stats ratiofrigates cruisers battlecruisers  the smallest relative differencebattleships the gain fleet command ships get over bc is relatively worse than the one for any other class while by any logic except the fuzzy one the relative gain is to be inbetween the cruisers and battleships

a list of exploits does not need to contain a step by step guide on how to make them occur the majority of the time and besides if people use it as an instruction manual to exploit especially a well known exploit then theres a very good chance theyll be caught and their account banned
if you want a list wouldnt this be handled better by creating a wiki page and letting players list exploits
to all the people out there saying but a list of exploits will just mean everyone will start exploiting because they know how now that might just gasp force ccp to fix whatever it is instead of the bs we put up with now for example the whole moon mining fiasco whats more it would temporarily remove the unfair advantage garnered by the players who already know about a given exploit
ccp did fix the moon mining thing as soon as they found out about it so again i say exploits usually are not known by ccp without being fixed so the list would containnode crashinggame modsafk macrosrl hackingrmtall of which are already listed in the eula so i have copied the list you asked for here for those who didnt think to look it is pretty straight forward

as the principal use of this would be to split loot amongst your squad which is limited to 10 then it would seem sensible to limit the split factor to to that so you would only be able to split a stack up to 10 waysi know fleets can be a lot more than 10 in total but the average group of friends mining or missioning will be single digits mostly i expect
thanks for the reply even if its half thought out and half assedthe point i made is simple there might be perfectly sound scifi and gameplay reasons behind the actual acceleration gate mechanicsbut that doesnt mean that its not annoying and unnecessaryas a matter of fact like you yourself would know if you played missions it is annoying and unnecessary that you cant bookmark or mwdwant a corollary solution to the monetary problem perfect reduce rewards bounties wed be ok running more missions as long as we dont have to wait minutes on end and waste our time watching at empty spaceits about time for this to change honestly or it could stay like this and contribute to repel potential players
beside the keep completion speed down reasons already given to restrict the use of mdw and the capability of warping to a bookmark in a mission room there are several others you should consider note that there are missions allowing the use of mdw and allowing you to warp directly to a bookmarked room1 npc tracking capabilities several npc are incapable of hitting a mdwing ships or have a short combat range for example serpentis and gallente ships a mdwing ship can easily become invulnerable to those factions ship fire2 player pirates allowing pirates to warp directly to the room where you are missioning lower the already low survival chances of a player missioning in low sec3 mdw use and pirates as above4 ninja salvagers allowing mdw use in a mission help greatly ninja salvagers and people wanting to steal crucial mission loot for ransom 5 direct warp in to bookmarks will allow the use of capitals in missions
again an off topic post might be that this subject normally appeals those that play rather than dwell the forums i myself put foot here only after two yearsanyhowwhat you guys want is the game to be boring and annoyingwell i can assure that you made your point clearlyin other words who the hell cares what are the reasons behind the current situation there are problems behind bookmark inability and mwd veto and this is an appeal to fix them to make the game more enjoyablethen let me go on over the stupidity of your reply1 lower the rewards problem solved you finish the mission quicker and actually wipe the room no problem2 this is simply not possible unless you have completed the mission and talked to the agent in which case you yourself are able to warp into the bookmark which is not the case of this proposal nor the situation i illustrated3see UFFFD14this is what the game is about inventive reactions ship configurations wits5exactly as it happens now you cant warp there because natural phenomena are blocking the warp you can keep anything you want out of a mission acceleration gateeverything i proposed is doable and would benefit the playerbasebut seemingly people who are willing to chime in want to rant and banter rather than accept the advantages that these modifications would bringagain theres no way to reasonably deny that what i wrote is right or backed up by facts so i havent changed my mind and i again support the topic
nobody likes a smartassim pretty damn sure venkuls been around longer than you have that or much more active to be sureanyone who comes here making assumptions without checking there facts are gonna get shot down right quicki suggest you take a step back from this proposal and reevaluate your just going to get flamedyour proposals as good spirited as they are would make mission running a living hellnot supportingproof go to dodoxi and mission there for a couple months and then take your proposal into the equation
im dense my response is now 50 less denseit doesnt really make any sense to say make this fix and immediately follow it up with there might be lore or technical reasons you cant but i dont careits the game lore you cant warp to these pockets theyre deadspace without this lore theres no purpose for the gate to exist in the first place and we might as well not have themi really dont think theres much point to having deadspace kill microwarpdrives though most missioners arent going to fit them anyway because the fitting will prevent their ships from being invincible flying incarnations of doom that they are todayif acceleration gates are truly the cause of your friends not sticking around in eve then maybe you should train up logistics ships to get them through the initial rough patches before they become addicted alternatively fly with them and make sure your fits are good enough that you dont have to warp out you can always come back later for salvage and loot after you turn in the missions the restriction is gone as youve already said
good luck with that sparkywhat youre asking for is trivial youre asking for a level of convenience that accomodates you  and frankly every pirate hunting for lowsec missioners you refuse to see the logic in what others have said simply because they dont carry any concrete metricsneither did you you said my friends left because missioning is haaaaaard your requests bring no advantages to the game other than allowing macro farmers to make money faster allowing pirates to more easily catch players in lowsec deadspace and accomodating your conveniencesits not that people are trolling or being negative its that youre not listening

wow im pleased that my humble offering was that well received im not sure how ccp might implement this but it would go a long way toward making the laughably pointless bounty system worthwhile without being as easily exploited as it is currentlyi would like to add a couple of responses to other repliesthe payout for ship destruction would come from the insurance payout for the ship and do reduce the bounty accordingly yes someone mentioned that this is an isk sink and theyre right i dont see any way to prevent yet another hole but it would work just fine imo as save with capitals the sunk isk would be relatively low overall and come from the targets insurance payout wallet hurting the bountied target which is the entire idea of placing bounties in the first place to make them a nice fat targetyes the current t2t3 insurance joke would be a gimp in this situation but then the pilot is likewise receiving a much reduced payout anyway if they even bother to insure the shiphow to place bounties is a quandary but i like the idea of only victims with killrights being able to post them this will limit frivolous bountiesid love to be able to place such bounties on entire corporations or alliances with payout remuneration coming from a corp wallet that can cover the payout selected at master wallet and moving downward this would allow victims of random suicide ganks and such to place penalties in a purely player driven manner on corpsalliances who allow their pilots to undertake those activities without resorting to a war declarationpayouts in this instance would be taken half from the insurance payout of any pilot in that corp that is destroyed and half from the corpalliance wallet that has sufficient isk to cover it if the corp cant cover the difference it is deducted from the insurance payout as normalconcord rules apply however to attempting to take a corpalliance bounty in secure space just because the corp or even individual may have a bounty it is not a war declaration and thus attacking these targets would have consequences in secure spacethe bounty would remain open an active so long as there is a remaining balance so multiple pilots could successfully undertake it simultaneouslyand in closing only the pilot inflicting the final blow will receive bounty payouts as with the current system it is then up to them to distribute it or not
hiafter reading all proposal to make a new bounty hunter proffession i continue to beleive taht 1 the bounty system must applied only in case of killright relation between killright and bounty is an evidence i think2 the system to be acceptable need to be unexploitable for pirates wanted to take advantage of this process3 apparently lots of podders prefer a unique bounty pot that lead to the problem of who can hunt who cause its the actual problem that lead on exploitsbut i also think if bounty is related to killright that the right to kill dont have to be keeped by only a few podders the problem is  how allow every person to acquire the right to chase for some bounty and what were the ocnditionsi cant aggreed the solution of positive security status only for 2 reason  1 it will only serve carebears and 2 the idea that only good people can hunt is stupid for me in a world of liberty like eveso we need a system that autorise anybody to become a bounty hunter but related to his faculties and security statusfor exemple if you just started for the first time youll just can chase for low reward bounty when you caught some bounty after a winning hunt youll can get the right to hunt bigger prices it can easily be related to a special standing like for mission runnersfor the security status there could be some options  if you have a sec status of lets say 20 or higher then you could just chase for bounty wanted people with less than 2 sec status its just for example i dont mean thoose numbers or the rightif youre a 2 sec status you could be allow to accept contract on people with high sec statusanother idea could be to use a cold war between bounty hunters and regular pirates for exemple a bounty hunter need to be inscribed in an office or something like factionnal warfare and a pirate could be inscribed in the other sidein high sec sectors pirates or disavantaged cause their were obligated to flee or just counter attack they cant engage unless concord will destroy themin low sec sectors it will be different cause its possible to camp or to attack in belt planetsin 00 like befor it will be the chaos but some sector controlled by players can create special units to fight both bounty hunters or wanted personn in addition to the defense of the systemso there are some ideas about the base of the problem if we wanna refond the bounty hunter system to be a real funny playable thing i think some of thoose ideas can be usedbest regards ramon wilco
it needs work but the basic idea is a good onet
id like to see a salvager drone be implimented into the available drone selection let me paint a pictureyoure completely solo no secondary characters with u no gangfleet mining in some asteroid field and a rat is inc you launch yer hobgoblin and it destroys the rat some 18km away are you gonna sack the salvage or are u going to lumber yer mining ship over to the wreck and use your salvager to pick apart the wreckanswer send the salvager drone skill drone  skill salvager droneif a mining drone can hold a mining laser and has the cargo area for ore then a salvager drone would have room for salvager fitting for what can be reclaimed from wrecksits just a thought
supported
this has been mentioned before and i believe ccp said there were issues with the drones cargohold capacity
yep the idea is as old as salvaging and has wide support but i couldnt remember the reason it wasnt implemented the actual skill for salvage drone operation even exists but you cant get it anymore the idea is good though so thumbs up just in case ccp figures a way to do it
a good idea that would allow more specialization and more game variety which in turn equals funsalvaging is tedious having your drones help you would make it a bit more funthumbs up
theres already a template ingame for it all that changes is the drones target from asteroid to wreckthe only salvage that takes up any significant space is metal scraps just about everything else has a tiny footprint per unitm3the only downside is if ccp relent and implement salvage drones some players will start whining they dont loot the wrecks aswell 
then y not make salvage drones into a alternative to tractor beams lets them drag wrecks to you for loot and salvage its a reasonable idea imo
it doesnt have to be implemented soon  it could be part of an expansion anyway it just looks really cool and i would like to see it in game sometime
i have to say i agree the main area of our screens should get more customisation if only for the fact that its where you spend most of your time looking when in space a few options to choose from would be great especially if you throw in a few visual styles with colour selection like we do with the ui as a whole alreadyjust one of the many ui improvements wed love in the future 
the capture the flag style sovereignty mechanics introduced in dominion have not been a big improvement over the previous pos based mechanics several issues remain1 time zone issues still predominate2 the timer based mechanics encourage megablobbing which the servers do not support and have not supported for a long time with fights frequently determined by which combatant is able to occupy a grid first3 a great deal of player time is spent camping a structure shooting a structure or repairing a structure all of which are boring grinds for the most part4 fights for sovereignty almost completely determined by capital ship engagementsattacking and destroying structures should not determine sovereignty the incentive to attack structures should be to deprive an enemy of a place to shelter resupply or repair just as it is in actual warfarei propose an alternative index based system that could leverage the existing strategic index as its basis here is a basic outline of the mechanics that i propose1 an attacker anchors sbus to contest sovereignty they are invulnerable once they are online2 after the sbus are online each player ship kill in the contested system effects the index kills by attackers lower the index kills by defenders raise the index the more valuable a ship is the more points it is worth toward raising or lowering the index3 majority attacker presence in space causes a mild index decay making it impossible to thwart an attack by refusing to fight majority defender presence in space causes a mild regen offsetting timezone differences and making it impossible to contest a system indefinitely by anchoring tcus and then withdrawing presence in space is defined as not docked in a station not behind a pos shield not cloaked and not in warp4 if the index reaches 10 the defenders have won the sbus automatically offline and unanchor and may be destroyed or scooped if the index reaches 10 the attackers have won the tcu automatically offlines and unanchors and may be destroyed or scooped 5 defenders who have occupied a system for a long time will have an inherent advantage the strategic index starts at whatever level it has been built to from 1 to 5 before the system is contestedunder this system battles for systems would not take place according to a fixed timer they will happen over days or weeks and encompass numerous small gang skirmishes and potentially major capital and subcapital battles to takedestroydefend structuresthis system will also better support larger theaters of war where fronts comprised of a number of systems are being contested simultaneously with forces being repositioned and reinforced as indexes rise and fall if the index is made part of the api we could all see the progress of ongoing wars in near realtime courtesy of the awesome folks over at dotlanif this system were adopted territorial wars in eve would be less about the endless camping anchoring shooting and repping of structures and waiting on their timers and more about all kinds of shiptoship combat some tweaks might be necessary but i think it would be far superior to what we have now or any system where sovereignty is based on shooting or defending structures
this would not stop blobs only encourage them more than they already are encouraged you would end up with a cluster being camped with a thousands of ships entry points having the majority of ships and a few ships rattingmining on the inside to cause the decay even then you would end up with a continual ping pong sov because of timezonesthis idea would exacerbate the timezone issues the purpose of these reinforcement timers is to force people from different timezones to play at the same time without the ability to force both sides to assemble fleets for a fight at a predetermined time sov would become extremely staticyou cannot design a game to be like rl conflict simply because players usually only devote maybe a few hours in a day to a fight as compared to nonstop fighting with no ability to escape in rl wars
a giant blob is just going to sit camping a choke point 237 forever under this system the giant blob really isnt going to do you any good as soon as it disburses and it would have to eventually the enemy will be right back in ultimately the only way to win would be to be better at pvp on a sustained basis than your opponentsov wouldnt really pingpong the index would tend to rise during one sides primetime and fall in the other until one side got the eventual upperhand by winning more skirmishes probably mostly on weekends and during border times when both sizes were on and depriving the other side of infrastructure to resupply and repair thats just what i want from a game to be forced to play at 2 in the morning for 4 hours on a weeknight only if those contesting sov were very evenly matched both in terms of combat skill and ability to replace losses there would still be plenty of reasons to assemble capital fleets at the same time to killsave stations poses hubs etc those would still matter they just wouldnt be mechanically tied to soveven in actual wars individual soldiers or even companies of soldiers dont fight nonstop for days or weeks on end though an entire army might there are skirmishes lulls in the fighting offensives etc theres no reason that a game cant be like that
i would like to see the ability to repper ships and mods in a pos environment especially drones however i think it would perhaps make it a bit too easy perhaps if ships that are parked in a ship maint array say overnight would slowly regenerate armor and structure automatically but it would have to be parked in there for a minimum of 6 hours or so in order to receive effect or an option made avail to repair ship in maint bay which it would tell you locks this ship out for x amount of time until repairs are finished and the ship is stuck in the maint bay until repairs are completed the amount of time depending on the ammount of damage needing to be repaired not really paying attn to this thread just felt like tossing in 2 cents and seeing if i hear back about it thru other channels
i had this idea but in a variant if ship assembly arrays build the ships shouldnt they also be able to repair them what if they required a number of minerals and an amount of time based on the damage to the ship therefore a 40 damaged ship would require 40 of each mineral required to make the ship and 40 of the time it takes to manufacture the shipi had a variant of that listed in my pos mechanics proposal listed herepos mechanics redesign
the remote ecm burst on motherships is a fairly effective weapon but its been in need of a change for sometime i think its obvious where we should go with it a remote projected racial ewar module the first thought most people have with this is gallente should get a remote dictor bubble amarr a cap neutralizing bubble and minmatar should get a webification bubble i think those three would be very useful although the captackling ewars would probably be more strategically useful they would also be overpowered imo it would be too easy for moms with their ewar immunity which i dont want changed and a long range warp in to do the job of tacklersrecons i think we should stick to the tech 1 ewar racial bonusesreplace projected electronic counter measures skill with projected electronic warfare  5 reduction in module activation  using a base 5min cooldown 3min 45sec w lvl 5  10 bonus to effect radius  using a base 20km radius 30km w lvl 5  20 bonus to effect duration  using a 20sec base effect duration 40secs w lvl 5  possibly add an isotope fuel costfuel cost im not sure on this but even though i dont want to lug extra combat topes around it does seem appropriateas for what these racial ewar bursts do i think it would be easier to balance and work with if we use the tech 1 racial ewar also remember caldari are the only race without a tech 2 ewar ecm gets dual bonuses on their t2 ewar ships ewar strengths are debateable but they should be significant the current remote ecm burst uses 25 ecm strength and is unaffected by ew skills using that as an example in adjusting the percentage based ews would really bust up somethings wed have a 190 sensor damp which would just make it an ecm basically so instead i went with the intention behind the remote ecm burst as being designed to be very effective these effects last the duration on any ships not ewar immune in the radius of the target this isnt a bubble going up its a ewar burst around a target effecting all ships nearbyracial effects numbers are a starting point and very debateable wyvern  remote ecm burst w 25 ecm strength nyx  sensor damp burst w 40 aeon  tracking disruption burst w 40 hel  target painting burst w 40last notes wyvern where ecm is meant to be the addition of effect duration like regular ecm makes this much more valuable than currently nyx could really hurt long range fleets as well as shortly after a wyvern uses its burst aeon with the right balancing the effect of this could be devastating to any turret based fleet hel this is a little tricky since this effect is the only really aggressive one this would need balancing to keep hels from using the burst to solopwn with fighterbombers but needs to be strong enough to be a worthwile addition to its fleetthanks for havin a look and please remember to check support if you like the idea remember values are just starting points obviously i leave the balancing to ccp the idea is what im proposing

hmm after readin a lot of posts down to the last one i want to add a bit of my own thoughtsdo not take this as an offense as i would just like to add some more flavour to this discussionmake 2 classes of missile boats of caldari design1st group has 10 kin dmg bonus and 5 to all other dmg types like kestrel2nd group gets rof raven for egi fly caldari and gallente myself and there is really a point in changing caldari ships if they are supposed to be the missile using race they shud get more benfits than only kin dmg per ship level trainedto everybody who complains bout that do not forget that if u want to pvp effectively u need to sacrifice at least 1 better 2 med slots for a warpjammer and preferably add a web coz missiles as well suffer from less dmg to a movin target actually missiles are the only weapon system u can run away from intys ye i know what u guys are gonna say trackin and stuff still missiles are outclassed coz they cant do instadmg which means ur missiles may fly and hit nothing coz the targets already deadi just wanted to add that missiles do suffer from speed as well add the fact that missile dmg is weak anyways compared to other weapons that makes em even less effective as they cud be and think of most fights take place at close range due to the somewhat limited range of tackle t2 warpjam is 24k not overheated there u go for missiles range bonus after all someone already mentioned that u can still warp out if a caldari missile boat breaks ur tank from rangeand not to forget by sacrificing med slots u kill a caldari ships tank due to the fact that shield tankin isnt as effective as armor tankin just take a look at the base specsemexpkinthermcaldari shields0504020 110armor gal50103535 130amarr50202535 130mimi60102535 130adding all res to one number shows what i mean u got a 20 point higher res in average as u would ever get on shields and the widely used damage control ii also grants more res to armor as it does over shields taht makes armor more effective compared to shield tanksso if caldari got a buff they would still suffer from weaker tanks and do just a bit more dmg what are people so afraid of caldari has been a step child when it comes to pvp for the last years and have been nerfed over and over this attempt wouldnt make em overpowered maybe bring em a bit closer to the other races to be able to compete a bit better when it comes to pvp which is the core of the whole game after allto those people who complain bout the buff i adress one question why dont u fly caldari guess i know the answer alreadyregards peoplesupported
er if the targets already dead then theres no problem is there your issue here is with killmail whoring
on the other hand rollthor the gallente and amarr have to sacrifice tank to do damage due to both mod types being on the lows the also suffer a loss of utility in the mids for the tackle that could be considered double the hit that the caldari sufferciting minmatar for armour is specious at best because minmatar tank depends on the ship your flying even within the same ship class eg ruppy armour stabber speed bellicose shield not that anyone uses the cose in pvp and scythelolarguing on natural resists is typically pointless because any ship the pilot is fussed about losing will be rainbowtankedthe fact of the matter is that the caldari as a whole do not need a blanket boost because as a whole they are balanced against the other races in terms of overall damage potential which means that in ideal circumstances which do occasionally happen damage is at a parity between races on equivalent fits this proposed fix would not do anything but unbalance the races what is needed as ive already admitted elsewhere is that certain underpowered ships require boosting in unrelated areas because they suffer from problems unrelated to their bonuses
exactly were gonna say tracking and stuff cause im about 99 sure its a hell of alot easier to outrack a gun to the point of no damage than it is to out race a missile to no damage and to get those speeds you need mwd which on any ship other than inty blows up your sig actually causing more damage and as somebody said km no disadvantage herefirst missile damage is not weak to other weapons and you can still warp out if a missile boat breaks your tank from range but you cant warp out if a turret boat breaks your tank from range was this in the patch notesno disadvantage herefail shield tanking and armor tanking are pretty much balanced each having their own uses in pvp shield buffer is good active shield is good armor buffer is good and more convenient i wont go into this but this is not related to the topic on handas for sacrificing mid slots your ships have more midslots for a reason and armor tankers must sacrifice tank for damage no disadvantage herelows slot module  hull and armor so obviously its going to benefit the hullarmor tankers moreno disadvantage hereadmitted missile pvp strategy is different than turret pvp but that in no way makes it inferior or less effective if used correctly missiles are very very good pvp weapons they can be more effective than turrets depending on the situationi dont fly caldari because i started gallente and cross trained to minmatar when i found gallente are sucking right now i value the speed of minmatar but am very jealous of the fact that missiles are pretty versatile in pvpsooooo whoops i guess you didnt already know the answer
dcu is low slot module so that means it takes up a slot in an armor tank and its a bonus slot for any shield tank you want to complain about that 
stil harkonnen your post clearly shows that you completly noob to missiles  have you ever used them at allpls use some missile ships before you make comments on them
i agree i only use my cormy as a salvage boat it is just a slowmoving target otherwise
v yesalso cant help supporting the original op seven pages back about the statementyes first one should be all unguided missiles the latter one all guided missiles

the concept of dust is a good one i think it will have a lot of playabilityccp is making a critical blunder with consoles only right off the bat there is 300000 people that have shown they like this ip by paying money to entertain themselves with it dust will not only provide those with sov a facet of game play but it will provide everyone and anyone that has any desire to strike back at people that have sov or anyone that wants to try something a little differentdust is a slap in the face or to use a fps term dust is ccp hf tea bagging there loyal customers so you say ccp hf is doing it for finical concerns my response is that those finical concerns are being financed by my money if they wanted a new revenue stream thats fine but connecting it to the product that i am paying for makes it a chief concern for meit does not matter if has a minor or major effect on eve the fact that that i have been excluded makes me want to stop my revenue stream on my 3 accounts till if and when they change their mind

as far as multistar systems go then according to backstory all the stars with stargates are binary or even multistar systems as you can not put stargate in single star system the neighbours of the binary star systems are just kinda supposed to be far enough from the star you are visiting to now show up on the system map i have myself also wondered though often how come we are visiting only one of the stars in those binary systems  if one of them has planets then how come second one does not have  unless its something sillyexotic and utterly impropable if one can have planets in stable orbits then gravity works both ways and second one should be far enough to allow stable orbits  ie there should also be stable orbits possible around the other star
please ccp pleaseit would probably be an utter pain to implement but its something to put on the back burner and get someday down the road right

this idea gets 70 of my 94 pogs

awesome idea this kinda stuff shoulda been a common sense modification to pos warfare in any case tbh
i do not like that a feature horizontally scaling fov has been taken away from me i do not enjoy playing eve at very wide resolutions anymorei really wish whom ever made this change would spend a few hours playing eve on a pre dominion client the a post dominion client at a very wide resolutionscreenshots and videos cannot explain this problem properly
ccp flaunts eve as a player run economy but much of it is still npc seeded for instance control towers pos modules ihubs and upgrades consumables like robotics nanite repair paste by creating bpos for these items ccp can open up more streams of manufacturing and remove more of artificial prices
i support this with song li as well this would create new industrial opportunities of global scale across all factions for a vast amount of items to be completely built and sold by capsulers
i totally agree maybe phased in over time
i strongly agree with song li on this
the tower idea is a great one do it like the bss keep the faction tower bpcs from complex rats ect and seed the amarrcaldarimingall smallmedlarge tower bpos
while i would like to see these things being player made and sold on the market something to consider is the effect your going to have on the market those items are an isk sink right now and without them acting like an isk sink we will have to come up with a different way to remove isk from the eve economy i think we can all agree that isk sinks are important and poss of all things are one of the most used isk sinks you can find anywhere sure sov with dominion costs isk now too and that sinks a large chunk of isk but i get the impression ccp was looking for more sinks not less if and only if another reasonable isk sink was brought up could i support this
this proposal would have to be balanced out by adding some form of isk sink to replace those lost by adding new bposnot supported
i think i see where song li is going with this but i would expand the idea to avoid the isk sink counterargument what about turning not just towers into bpcs or a rare bpo drop but lots of items like skill books in effect you are then making them an isk sink because players have to venture into space and explore which is what space is all about to get them which is an isk sink in itself you lose ships in 00 tweaking of sitesplexes or adding them as a reward to a huge mission arc are ways of getting people to spend isktime to get the reward just today i was in a 00 system trying to run a plex and got jumped on the way out a friend lost a 100 million isk ship  isk sink we didnt even get to finish the site it despawns and the cycle starts again anyways  the idea needs to be expanded though i would even like to see this replace invention and see things like t2 bpcs run this way complex goals and datacores from research alts all required to run a mission that takes you into 00 etc etc to get this bpc make the isk that needs to be spent come from the things we need to be expendable ships tritmins modules etc podding is an issue but the new standings fix should have fixed that to not ultimately deter 00 completely not to mention making missions diverse enough to where larger knowledgable corps cant camp them or monopolize them just my 2 isk
no that is not an isk sink isk sinks remove isk from the game not a persons wallet when your friend bought that ship he gave those 100m isk to someone else and that someone still has it in addition to that your friend got insurance from his ship adding even more isk to the gamei thought it was a great idea right up until i read the isk sink arguement if a way can be found to make everything player made while replacing the isk sink functionality of them i will support it again but until that point it would hurt the economy too much to be worth it
towers and their modules are usually bought with general proximity to where they will be set up as a retired empire pos cleanup expert i know that the majority of my postop sales of faction pos modules are made to buyers i can find in my journal  those that bought a tower or other pos modules from mebeing able to track who is buying what kind of pos  loadout and where could result in an unnecessarily risky traders environment for newer corps hoping to go set up their first towerif the tower purchase is transparent the chances of someone noticing them and finding out where they set up the tower are greatly diminished if the tower purchase is not transparent someone could intentionally have a character that sells nothing but towers in order to review the buyer in their journal then have a scout follow the buyer to find out where they set upbesides these elements this would remove an isk sink from the game as mentioned by others there are few enough of these as it is
not supported because of isk inflation
strong support for this if you think about how isk sinks and faucets are laid out now vs the direction the csm has been pushing them for a few terms this makes a lot of sensethey need to exist both of them but they need to be in the right places opening up these things to player production increases market areas for people to compete it increases the value of a strong industrial backbone for alliances and is much more in keeping with the spirit of the gamei mean heck npcs could sell everything in the game ships mods etc but itd not be nearly as cool of a game eve has a largely player run economy and thats a major selling point for the game i see this proposal either all at once or more likly something ccp phases in gradually as aimed toward a more perfect realization of that goal
a good idea is a good idea regardless of who has it fully endorse this as for isk inflation not seeing how this would be so
support this we already build the rest of stuff why not the rest to
specifically with respect to pos and pos modules these are one of the largest isk sinks so as others have said the isk flow would have to be very carefully rebalanced to compensate ithowever one very good effect of making these into playermade items would be that they would be a huge mineral sink which we badly neededit however pos should only be producable in losec00 in the same way capital ships are in fact it would be cool if they needed an upgraded outpost to create since it would actually make 00 industry economically and strategically relevant
speaking as an industrialist im quite pleased with the idea of even more markets to try and sell items in howeveryou just saw that coming rightthey need to be phased in in such a way that the hard costs to corporations and alliances for holding and maintaining space stations and other things arent erased and replaced with soft costs by hard costs i mean money that actually leaves the organization or in this case the eve economy as opposed to money that circulates around inside itthe primary reason for this concern is that in eve it is very possible for a large enough alliance or corporation to produce every item they could possibly needtypically for less than the market price ergo profit but doing this for some of those items particularly the consumables will actually reduce the hard costs of holding sov and maintaining towers by whatever percent the acceptable markup isfor example my employer has something like 1800 servers in our data centers but we dont make our servers we buy them because its cheaper for us to buy them from someone who makes them and resells them but exactly the opposite situation exists in eve its equally practical for a large corporation to make a given item as it is for them to buy it and making it is normally cheaper given an assumption of equal practicality that is the materials needed are on hand and the facilities exist to do so cost is going to be the determining factor in how large corporations do procurementif the cost to make these items is 20  30 just to have some numbers to work with it will lower the cost of the related activities pos fueling etc by that much reducing the effectiveness of those isk sinks on maintaining a relative balance in the economyall of that said i am not opposed to the csm bringing this up with ccp but i think careful consideration needs to be applied to the long term effects that the change over of some of these items might produce
partial supporti wouldnt like to see the npc items as bpos but as bpcs bpos imo would destabilize the markets too much and wouldnt work as well as an isk sink
how about bpos for the control towers etc that use trade goods for ingredientsrequirements to keep the isk sink
supported only if you compensate with another isk sink
towers  i dont know if all towers going to be made out of ore there will be a serious mineral problemnpc loot remove all from l4 missionsmeta level npc loot only drops from pirate faction npc lootconsumables pos fuel need to be seeded by npcsother condumable seeded trough bpos
not supporting bposbpcs i would possibly support but id want to see detailed analysis on ingame impact a change like this would have
assuming all the macroeconomic effects balance out at least roughlyonce you make any other changes alongside this im for it
like removing meta 0 loot from missions another song li proposalit seem some of the current csm member have no idea of eve isk and item sink and faucets balance and are pushing in one direction only  toward a large price inflation reducing isk sinks and item faucets while increasing mineral use unless they can refine this kind of suggestions and present some new isk sinks balancing the effect of the proposal made till now not supported
provided that a proper isksink is put in place to make up for it yes
while im all for improved marketing and manufacturing i dont think this idea is the best unless massive changes to the market are made the economy as it is right now is very smooth with a large amount of isk gathered traded and lost faucets market and sinksif we tried to reduce the number of isk sinks by this proposal we would either have to replace them with other isk sinks no insurance other items which only npcs sell etc or reduce the number of faucets limit mining no missions etc both of these i cannot see happeningi would eventually like to see meta 0 loot stop being dropped by npcs and perhaps replace them with tags or something similar but this cannot happen until the number of manufacturing lines are doubled and mining is made more interesting so more people will want to do it until these two effects take place removing meta 0 loot from npcs would be a disaster to the economy and the games delicate balanceim not saying that the answer is not out there for this problem but it would require a nearcomplete economic rewrite if it aint broke dont fix ittldr too complicated to implement with too many hurdles to overcome not supported

removing local massively increases the risk to the very people that ccp is trying to entice out of highsec as various dev blogs and posts made perfectly clear during the build up to dominion 00 is supposed to be a viable place for people to live fulltime to rat and mine and construct not just a battlegrounds arena where people visit to pvp before heading back to their empire homes if anything ccps future plans for 00 are to make it even safer and more profitable for the residents not to pull the rug out from beneath their feet and send them fleeing back to motsuremoving local would be hilarious fun for the roaming hac gangs for about a week after being ganked a few times by undetected hostiles the average 00 ratter will say screw this and head back to the safety of highsec to run missions like a sensible person hope you guys enjoy a deserted 00 and roaming for 4 hours without finding a single target
wonder why people that get ganked by undetected hostiles in wormhole does not get back to hisecif you cant protectate you space you deserve to leavelvl4 are broken but that the diffrent matter thats i would like combination of nerfing local and increasing personal income in 00 by about 25
wormholes are fun but theyre a niche arena for relatively small numbers of players the entrances and exits are dynamic and unpredictable the amount of people who can use one before it collapses is limited and they dont show up on the map its not as though your roaming hac gang can log in and the fc says ok guys lets go back to that same wspace system we visited last week because the entrance has probably moved on and so theres no predictable route as things stand wspace pvers have a fine balance with 00 pvers if you find a group of wormholers before they find you then you can sneak up on them without local spooking them and hurt them badly but the wormholers are much harder to find in the first place since usually nobody knows where they are or how to get to themon the other hand 00 and lowsec is already known anyone can look at a map to see where the abc ores and the l4q20 agents are and who has put up infrastructure or can can just look at the red npcs killed in the last 24 hours dots on the map and know exactly where there are ravens to gank and exactly how to get therewith the exception of ccp engineering alliance theres not a single alliance in this game that can prevent hostiles roaming through their space and by removing local youll vastly reduce the opportunity for space holding alliances to even detect and respond to such incursionsso i guess your argument is that everybody should leave 00 and go back to highsec hey remove local and maybe youll get that wish but ccp produced the dominion expansion specifically because they wanted to see thriving 00 populations and industries rather than empty wastelands populated by moonmining towers and the occasional refueleryou could increase potential personal income in 00 by 50 or 100 or 250 it doesnt matter if all that happens is that the ratter loses his ship to a pack of undetected hostiles when he tries to go out and make that income hes not going to stick around to get ganked over and over hes going to say screw this and move to motsu to make a safe even if it is nerfed l4 income

interface improvement make modules more clearly activeever since we changed from the classic client to the more shiny polished client we went from clearly visible green lights showing module activity to this green glow effectnow depending what color you set your ui and if there are bright nebulas in the background it becomes nearly impossible to see if a module is active or noti propose ccp makes more clearly visible lights showing module activity  or even make it customizable a bit what color etc but most importantly make it so we can allways see if a module is active or not ea bright green light on active  red light on turned offcheers
im not disagreeing entirely here but is the moving white circle around the module not enough for you to tell them apart
i dont think the issue would be with actual m3 cargo but rather with the type if youre sending a mining drone to an asteroid nothing needs to be stored in cargo all you need to do is start a timer as soon as the drone reach the asteroid and when that timer runs out the drone returns and x amount of the appropriate ore type is created if you send a salvage drone to a wreck it needs to actually test if its successfull instead of just having a timer and if it is it need to remove the wreck and memorize what specific salvage items and in what amount were retrieved without actually adding it to a real cargo bay until it reach your ship again the cargo bay on mining drones is probably not a real cargo bay but rather just a value used to inform you about how long it will take for your drone to complete its timer so that it can return to your ship and create the item when it gets therehowever if ccp can find a way to solve it support
for a drone to carry stuff it needs to become a database entry that can have dependent entriesthat is to say something similar to thisplayer independent parent entity  rupture container  cargohold container sublevel  tritanium 1x  civilian damage control 1x  standard secure container container subsublevel  emp m 3440x  bloodclaw light missile 1785  salvager drone container dependent child entity hooked to ai controller interface  cargohold container sublevel  armor plates 13x  alloyed tritanium bar 8x  corpse female hey drones get lonely toonow when the drone gets scooped it would have to perform an asset trade with the players ship in space first to get rid of its assets whats in its cargohold doesnt belong to you on a database level until its in your cargo it cant be scooped until the asset trade has been completed because that would place a dependent artificially controlled entity within a user controlled entity with its own dependency tree why this is bad is because like with putting a hyperactive child in a car the child is going to be asking are we there yet before youve even turned on the engine a drone will be constantly checking to see if it has something to do with its cargo or if theres any of its ai routines to perform even while in your drone bayso upon scooping it would not only need to be emptied before being scooped to your cargo causing an extra database transfer of dependencycontainer trees but its ai would need to be unhooked to prevent it from going berserk in your dronebay when launched an entire subset of ai controllers would need to be reenabled for the drone in addition to the current comparatively basic set of controllers in place already just for it to float around and ignore your commandswhen you launch drones theres a brief spike before they appear this is them being changed from a standard database entry to an ai controlled dependent child objectwhen you scoop drones there is a brief spike as their ai gets killed and they are turned back into a container objectwhen you launch fighters their standard drone ai is loaded in addition to their subset of ai that controls whether they follow something in warp or notthese kinds of issues are the same reason you cant have players docking with carriers motherships or titans right now because youd essentially be placing a player inside another playernow im no database engineer nor programmer so im trying to explain this in laymens terms based on what i understand of databases that said i could be entirely wrong but as far as im aware there are good and similar reasons why this sort of thing isnt being done alreadywith reference to mining drones im thinking that how they work is after their cycle time they essentially remove a portion of the idquantity from an asteroid and are assigned a temporary idquantity tag which when they get to your ship causes them to spawn an invisibleimaginary container that your ship automatically retrieves the ore from if your cargo is full the container is spawned allowing the drone to dump the ore and then despawns immediately this couldnt work for salvage as for salvage to exist it needs to be removed from a very real databaseside container the wreck placed into a very real container for the drone then placed into one of these invisible containers to be moved to your ship
have salvage drones simply recycle the wrecks into cargo containers whislt in space that way you eliminate the problem of having a transfer on dock  all the drones would do would be to harvest a wreckage field so the player would come along and scoop the leftover containers up with a tractor beam
if not a salvager drone at least a tractor drone would be nicefor tractor drone i mean a drone that reach a distant wreck or jetcan lock it with a tractor beam and the return to your ship with it in tow not as useful as an actual salvage drone it will still be a nice addition to the utility drones
and completely remove all the work ninjas have to do to get at salvage as the wrecks now come presalvaged for them and they need to nothing but loot themhell yeah i completely support that ideathis wouldnt at all please those that are wanting to use drones to clean up salvage for them where they are ignoring loot by default though which i think accounts for the majority of the people wanting something like this rather than the minoritythey want their salvage brought to them on a silver platter not to have to work for it
well sorry like i said i am new to this forum so i will try not to write multiple suggestions next time and ok i can agree that self destructing a ship is possible etc etc but you should still get somethingkillmail the comment of stop playing kb online i dont know any pvper that i have talked to that doesnt like killmailsits how we get our satisfaction and feeling of fulfilment carebears get shiney new items from lp agents etc miners get iskies we just want kms to make us feel awesome  i dont think that it is to much to ask
my issue is that we kill caps for profit self destruct on a ship that takes 78 bss 5 min to kill means were denied any loot at all bar salvage which isnt that great anyway despite what some obvious self destructing pros are saying in this thread the majority of players who have an opinion on this agree that its a mechanic that needs to be revisitedanyone who suggests bring more dps is just spewing the common response to this complaint and theyre wrong because usually it takes more than 2 min to get support from a couple of jumps away on an impromptu request
you know if we just deleted killmails from the game entirely wed solve all of these problems
i can understand that and i agree that general mining needs to have static locations to aid the new players especially in starter systems however ice is a field that takes about two months to get into and thats only if you dedicate yourself to achieving this goal above all othersin addition having the belts scanned out into deadspace complexes would accomplish many goals such as making suicide ganking the ships with disposable alts far more difficult and making the whole task of ice mining more dynamic ive weighed all the options very carefully and i think this is the best solution to the problemdoes anybody know why i have to reply to one of the posts i created just to support it steupid forum software
sovereignty is supposed to be decided by capital blobs this is not actually a bad thingeven if the hamsters tend to cry about it id like to see there be more stuff for smaller groups to do but sov warfare should not be done by half a dozen guys in ceptors reinforcement timers are fight brokers and are specifically designed to put hundreds of dreads on the field at once also those sorts of fights are at least half of eves public relations  even if they tend to be a bit lame in practice they still need to happen

i suppose it wouldnt be assembly hall if we didnt have at least one thread whining about how a company isnt sharing all of its internal disciplinary affairs with the consumers no
a thing ive been thinking of for a while now wouldnt it be great if the station andor system name in the assets window was highlighted in insert random color when your current route is set to pass through that system or just put a highlight on the number of jumps in the listi always end up with a bunch of random stuff spread out over different stations would be a nice feature as you easily could monitor if you have some crap you could pick up in case you are passing through and happen to have some space left over in your carge
i like your idea
minor but more useful than some of the star colourings they have in there now sure

from your dev blogs you guys were looking to have the motherships proudly wear the name mothership again  then make modules can be fit onto them and that can replicate the strange phenomena encountered inside wormhole space for an entire system

i will consider it because you asked so nicely  seriously you are moaning about the hassle of counting the delegates yet are complaining about the triviality of the topics in the meeting double standards i suggest you read the csm dev blogs  short summary  which will answer many of these questions short answer 7 voters are required for a vote to count and it will pass only with a majoritythere are 9 full members and unsurprisingly that is also the maximum number of people who are allowed to vote on any one issue alternates will step in and vote if less than 9 full delegates are presentabstaining is not allowedregarding trivial issues they have to be raised as per anything else however ccp will put them on a separate list for the iceland summit ie they wont take time away from important issues when we talk to ccpbecause we represent the players and the players bring this stuff up ignoring stuff because you think it is trivial just means it clogs up the forums for monthsno it is saying that players have raised these issues and the csm have classed them as trivial again trivial items go on a separate list to ccpthank you captain obvious if you read the minutes i seemingly wasted 5 hours preparing you will see that i and others said exactly that to the proposalthere are 9 full delegates and they get to pick which issues they wish to cover i am no more responsible for what korvin decides to bring up as he is for what i want to bring upim sorry you feel that way and hope to see you running for csm next time to show us all how to do better
suggest changesallow ships to be renamed when they are not active ship ideal would be renaming any ship at any timeif you need to repack an item to sell it if the game could repack automatically in the case of nonships that would be sweet obviously autorepacking ships sucks because it voids insuranceplease autorepack anything youre trying to stack other than ships
yes yes a thousand time yes
this sort of thing poor interface design unnecessary keystrokes etc is my pet peeve when it comes to nearly all software im glad someone else shares my neuroses from a design perspective what sort of system should be put in place to prevent bad ui from occuring in the future any ideasmainly i just dont understand the concept of packaging from a gaming perspective im curious why its in the game at all perhaps theres a good reason for it but regardless the ui aspect of packaging can be streamlined to remove it from the gamer experience basically
point out to me the flaws pleaseif i have some false information about missiles please point them out so i can stop looking like a the only comment that im not too sure about is the one about missile damage i think the smaller sized missile launchers might have damage issues such as rockets for sure but i know that once you get up into medium and large missiles they do not have damage issue and maybe something about missile strategy i admit i do not often use missiles in pvp but have seen missiles used against me i am not completly noob but please tell me how what i said is wrong i would like to know and thats not sarcastic id really like to know
yet another example of incisive and surgically precise argumentationor notare you sure your not just griefing harkonenif the likes of triumvirate and burn eden can make highly effective use of missile boats then it speaks more to your lack of knowledge that you are accusing him of idiocy
can confirm that hams and torps are just fine and i use them daily
can we at least agree that the leviathan needs its damage bonus changed to all missile types because unlike other caldari missile ships you cannot use nonkinetic missiles in a leviathan at least not without proving yourself to be the worst kind of braindead noob the damage difference isnt 525 its 100500
confirming the confirmation ive never seen naomi make a post that is constructive or supported by evidence her game is whinging nothing more
even if it is much harder to outrun missiles than turretsit is much more easier to lower missile dmg than turretyou just only need to move your ships as most missiles wont hit for max dmg without webbingtargetpainting the targetoh and you dont need to travel transversally like against turrets which is much harder to do in actual battle as fleet size increase you will find it that you wont be able to keep transversal up against all enemy not like missiles where all enemy will still suffer from your speedtarget speedsignature decreases missile dps much more than it does with turret dps it doesnt matter if turrets miss sometimes and missiles dont while turrets still do more dmg with those hits than missilesturret dps applied as soon as you fire while missile dps will have delay usually 1015 sec at long range so if you have enough dps to kill the target in 8 secs and target can warp out in 9secs then turrets will kill the target and missiles wont that shows how bad delay dmg isalso if you keep firing at the target until it is deadwarps out you will loose your missiles still in flight to the targetthis doesnt happen with turretsno they arent balancedyeah this isnt related to this topic damage control just favours armor more than shield for no reasonive already pointed out that it is unbalanced in another topicwhat is missile strategy thenall should fly the same caldari ships in your gang to be able to use that strategythat is hardly doable except for caldari role players yes missiles are much less effective thats why most snipe gangs use turretsi realy dont get where missiles are more effective than turretsat close range turret shipsmissile ships and at range where long range missiles dps gets more than turret dps the delay just kills that advantage easilyso how should missiles be used corretlybecause using turrets corretly is easydo they nowadays because as i checked out burn edens kb it shows me they use amarr ships most of the timesame with triums at least they had some ravens in one of their battleswonder why they did that as other battles completly lack missle shipsso isnt this hightly effective missiles are the past and only lives in your memory
wrong apart from rockets anyway and theyre getting their booststop blobbing
youre forgetting that even a little movement causes not so perfect hits with turrets lowering the dps think about blasters where even in optimal range the target must be webbed and scrambled in order to maybe do a large portion of the dps kinda like missiles they must be webbed and painted in order to do large portions of dpsmissiles have no real disadvantage in this areaturrets almost never do perfect dps either and must use webs and painters to do full damageguns have signature radius too you know if youre shooting at an undersized target with missiles youre going to do less damage just like turretsi saw somebody complain about how their torps were doing 10 dps to a t3 cruiser in another thread wrong sized weapon systemif youre really worried about losing those 48 missiles that get lost in flight time youre probably just not carrying enough ammo this has nothing to do with the kinetic bonusalso the issue of how slow missiles are has nothing to do with the kinetic bonus make a new thread to increase speed and decrease flight time dont try to use that as an argument of why caldari boats should get rainbow bonusesshield and armor tanking are pretty much balanced shield gets recharge armor get slightly more buffer shield cap intensive but can tank more dps for a short time armor can be sustained but cant tank as muchim not going into it anymore but they are balanced and damage control is a low slot module thats for armor and hull it does what its supposed to do and shield gets a little bonus it favors it more cause its an armor and hull module it goes in low slot i dont know what else to say to get you to stop ignoring that factusing turrets is not easy in fact id say its a little harder than using missilesas for using the same missile boat to get same strategy same goes for turret ships missile boats aer no different you wouldnt use a muninn with a vagabond and expect them to use same strategy one is short range and the other is long range obviously you need to use turret ships that go well together and use missile ships that go well with each other there is no difference or disadvantage to anything there
are you serious or just trollingyou have just made an argument for limiting drone ship bonuses to only their racial drone type
confirmation confirmed well thats that then
agreed about removing rof penalty and decreasing sig and maybe mass a bit maybe extra 5 to fittingas for slots and bonuses leave them alone and learn to figure out the ships purposes destroyers are for the most part pack animals and not solopwnmobiles catas bonus to optimal works just as fine as falloff bonus for blasters  because optimal is half their range  and gives it flexibility to fit rails but of course not compete with cormorant in that corms tracking bonus makes sure it will hit the target not only at max range but also as its spiraling towards you and with 75 tracking penalty on spike you need that extra tracking replacing tracking bonus with damage bonus wont help at all  you still wont alpha anything solo and if youre a sniper you wont point anything either also without tracking bonus youre taking away its flexibility to be anything except the longrange sniper if you need more grid  use rigs theyre cheap now if you need even more grid  train advanced weapon upgrades you should have it anyway tbhinterdictors could possibly use some looking into  though on the other hand they will likely be fine once rockets are fixed they could share the sig radius decrease with destroyers though if that comes throughoverall not supported in proposed form

proposed lowsec expansion outlawi renamed the thread titlelowsec needs some serious attention to make it the great place it should be and im not talking about fw which is pretty much unrelated to real lowseclowsec is about criminals its about piracy its about the dark underworld of new eden i think its about time it had some deserved attention it would take a lowdec patch to really turn it into the place it should be i suggest ccp do just that the update should be called outlawi have the following proposals for this and by no means are these all my ideas so thanks to all the people who have put ideas around before1 criminal underworld similar to 00 sov recognition should be given to the overlords who dominate systems some sort of benefits may be bought with underhand payments to authorities such as the rats in a system may notengage unless fired upon or reduced facility rates offices etc maybe something similar to the new sov mechanics with a hub pos using modules to upgrade the system this would need to be les impacting than 00 so the best you could upgrade should not be as good as an unupgraded 00 system2 criminal faction agents for missions beter rewards for missions in lowsec generally thesse agents would be ayt pirate stations that can only be found by probing3 the blackmarket have a market that can only be accessed when in lowsec and with items that can only be sold on the black market all illegal items moved onto this market maybe with npc smuggling items too create more illegal items to load onto the market more drugs maybe illegal implants see also 4 the black market panel only becomes available when in a black market station which would only be the piratecriminal stations4 pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec so whilest usable in hisec become available only through the black market5 make better smuggling oportunities with these illegal items make a smuggling proffesion more viable6 crooked cops have random faction npcs for that region wander lowsec looking for payoffs hand over a little isk to go free or fight themmaybe the overlord can see to it that these crooked cops dont interfere with their people7 have lowsec borders between all the empires or at least the empires who are at war so there is no safe route for people this way people would actually hire escort personel to protect haulers another career opportunity smugglers would also be employed in such places8 new pos modules such as pleasure hubs and so on could be you need to supply it with drugsfoodalcahol etc and in return it earns money would need to be limited to like 1 or 2 per pos though to avoid large pos super brothels being built enmass in systems to make huge isk this income should be small in comparison to moon mining etc9 some form of cyno jamming as in 00 lowsec is becoming blobbed with caps possibly only the system that an alliance has godfather status could be cyno jammed would be part of the upgrades available to system overlords10 better ore better missions etc to keep the isk warriors coming in despite the riskalot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec but people need to have a reason to go there im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked yes im a pirate but i prefer a fight what id like to see is more organisations fighting for turf gang wars pirate factions fighting each other or real opportunities for anti pirates to go in and wage war against their hated enemieswe need a deeper immersion for lowsec bring it on please make lowsec the dark and dangerous underbelly that society loves to hate lowsec shouldnt be a dangerous version of hisec just as 00 isnt a no concord version of hisec it should be a seperate experience in itself
some interesting ideasthe one that all empires should be connected by losec only i wonder how that would end upeve would become larger again and hisec diversified
bump for some good ideas
some questionable ideas but overall its the right direction to goill add something toon1 make some ore available only via lowsec belt mining why should those bottlenecks exist only at the moon mining leveln2 set the local chat in the delayed mode come on thats gonna be cool
low sec problem is that pirating is easy it is extremely easy to find targets if they are there and kill them if they arent there searching for a fight so most people that is not interested in pirating spend as little time as possible in low secso making pirating even easier will not help you it will simply push even more people away from low sec
the problem is that pirating is easy so if you go into lowsec without proper protection or fleet you will die however nobody even goes to lowsec unless theyre stupid or looking for a fight because everything in high sec and 00 is safer and more profitablebump for a lowsec boost
because real lowsec consists of smartbombing a gate for hours on end no lowsec is mostly about some failure smartbombing a gate for hours on endwho knew i actually like this idea maybe if you rent an office in a lowsec system you have an option to pay a monthly bribe to avoid gate gunsthis already exists sort of sure sprinkle a few more agents around lowseclame and impractical most illegal items either have no use whatsoever or are hardly used ie boostersnot only lame but incredible stupid unless your goal is to crash the pirate ship market completely items that are only made by npcs and only bought by npcs are lame as for smuggling its already in game just try to fly a fat load out of jita but cross your fingersperhaps we could call them rats and put them in belts hmm belt ratsthis idea has been proposed over and over and overbasically what it amounts to is the guys gate hes smartbombing isnt getting enough traffic and could ccp do something to make ppl stand in line to be killedlow sec isnt terf its a wasteland if i wanted terf id go to nullsec if i wanted relative safty id go to hi sec if im bored and want to see ppl smartbombing gates i go to lowsec why exactly are we comparing everything to hi sec
i could see this as it would give an isk sink to compensate for the increased rewards with item number 2 however the main reason there arent as many targets in lowsec is due to the reputation so only systems of 03 or below should have this advantage to allow players to experience a bit of lowsecurity space without being totally safei agree with this one since concord isnt there the pirate organizations would flourish we could have npc 00 space be devoted to semiempire groups ore mordus thukker etc and lowsec split up into criminal organizations thats not to say that 00 wont have any pirate organizations as there will always be scouting and resource harvesting groups in 00makes sense this is where boosters and such items could be sold and maybe other new lowsec only items overloaded mining crystals etcthis one i can agree with under one stipulation that people would be able to pay a premium to fly them basically take out part of the mission reward to compensate for each mission otherwise nobody would want to risk their precious ships and wed see them become less powerful than the us congressi would like to see smuggling become a new profession in this game and this would be a good way to do it it would take a fair amount of coding to do though and new skills would have to be introduced to compensate such as eft already listsim kinda on the fence about this one it would allow people to fight opposed factions creating a sortof antipirate belt rat with special mechanics but it wouldnt be essential to the core mechanics overhaul sounds reasonable if the time permits thothis one im against if you want this lowsec region to be a criminals dream dont force it upon the highsecurity dwellersyou might consider creating a bypass a special gate mechanic that would allow the ships instant passage across the lowsec region for a price this way npc goods from warring factions would cost more but you wouldnt have the forced risk of transportation and lack of trust which pervades player interactions in this gameoverall your ideas are pretty refreshing similar to the recent las vegas conference ccp had the main thing that needs to change is the rewards ratio in lowsecurity space as it currently doesnt pay enough to be in lowsec tentatively supported
maybe although this needs to go hand in hand with updated stationhugging mechanics i can see that having no sentries may be beneficial but may become too much of an advantage for the overlords in addition there would need to have a huge mechanic included which would involve pretty much an entire expansionyes there should be pirate agents in lowsec lvl 14 and more of those inty onesin addition level 4 agents over quality 6 or so should be placed in lowsec possibly even over q0yep i suggested this one in cp  boosters implants hardwires pirate faction ammunition and modules all should be in lowsec only this might be going too far although the sale of those ships should be illegalyepnpc pirates that interact itd be too much there are plenty of prats to go around that ransom whats needed is a ransom icon on the selected item window when pressed against a target the other player has some sort of notification not an intrusive chat window but maybe some kind of blinking dialogue box if the victim pays the ransom the pirate loses its lock for 35 seconds or so this could also be logged and placed for a true ransom board it would also make honoring ransoms more of a probability without forcing pirates to actually ransomive thought about this however it would only isolate people and not solve the issue for example to run from jitarens its a long hisec only route and a much shorter cut through but carebears will still prefer the long way most of the timethere needs to be more of an incentive a tortugalike atmosphere incarna can build on this a bit by allowing gambling and banned activities in stationslarger pirate corps need motivation to claim a system extort players but in the same breath protect their investment the possibility is thereforget removing wtz and complaining about that its here to stay fix station camping and teach people how to avoid smartbombing battleships its too easy people too easy
edit in response to cybermanthese are the new just for gallente experimental storylines which send you 12 to 25 jumps the last 2 to 5 in low sec systems in fw space to destroy enemy baseships these are being handed out to pve players including noncombat pilots who are grinding courier andor mining missions it is making it very very difficult to get faction gains for gall and most players are just dropping storyline missions as a way to get pve players to consider fw and low sec it is crass blunt and stupid idea which shows very little understanding of the mission runner player base i have put my comments in two threads
strongly supported although i only had to go two jumps into lowsec when i got this mission i still turned the mission down due to the bring friends statement storyline missions should include a bit of risk evident by the lowsec courier missions with 40k m3 cargo however this was just downright stupid
this sure is a fun rant
1 its easier to make games for2 they want diffrent players3 pc players suck at fpss when they can point and click so lulz4 eve players do not need console players to do anything it just makes things easier its like learning skills dont need them but makes things faster5 you cant hav consoles mixed to pc in the same game pc players only have to point and click 6 quit whining its not out yet
not supported personally i love playing fps with the classic keyboard  mouse combo i find console controllers tolerable but sluggish howeveri would rather play a multiplayer fps on a console these days for the same reason i stick to single player in pc rts games and mainly play mmo games cheaters cheating is certainly possible on consoles but its far more difficult and if im going to enter into a contest of skill the playing field better be bloody well eveni can play four or five awesome rounds in a row on pc and then one turd logs into the server and ruins everyones evening with a wallhack an aimbot or some other form of asshatteryid rather deal with a slightly sluggish controlleras a final note cost isnt an issue these days for consoles you can buy a secondhand 360 premium for 100 quid and xbox live is dirt cheap if you buy a 12 month sub the new models of both the 360 and ps3 are actually pretty reliable so if you do your research and buy the latest versions theyll last a good few yearshtfu and buy a secondhand 360

how about also fixing caldari hybrid ships so they could actually use blasters too wait what caldari hybrid boats can someone fly them what about other weapons tracking small targets torpedoes anyone pew pew 10 dps on tech 3 cruiseri am just saying while i understand gallente ship pilots are annoyed that their blaster boats arent so awesome than ie equal level drone boat i think just simply boosting gallente blasterboats isnt really right way to do this also gallente ships have some advantages compared to amarr etc amarr cannot fit so many tackling mods on mid slots to target paintwebtracking modules on mids anyone
wut torps on t3 cruiser is going down two hull classes obviously youre getting almost no dps youd be lucky to get 10 dps out of large neutron blasters on a t3 cruiser

this shouldnt be an idea it should be a responsibility of designers not forcing them to adhere to the most extreme disabilities to the point of detracting from worthwhile product development but make it at least more easy to mesh handicapped users into the gamein america we have the ada that sets forth particular requirements for handicapped accessibility sometimes with ludicrous resultsdemands why then should developers then ignore the same
i have worked on interface accessibility design and i support this it would be great if games designers took these issues seriously

i support this ideaand also request to get an enslave option on freed slaves and homelessand possibly tourists and definitely on freedom fighters to make them into elite slaves 
no need for a new database itemfreed slavesall thats needed is a way to convert one type to another which could be done with the right click menu when in station
first you want the slaves freed then you invoke the amarr deity you make no sense
yes release the slaves
im pretty sure i supported an option like this a year or so back but whatever i still want it
agreed wholeheartedly all commodities should be manufacturable even the ones with utterly now use ground vehicles these represent planetary production but capsule pilots should not be barred from also supplying such commodities to whomever requires themremove commodity sell orders and make buy orders dynamic by material cost indexes by npc corps and introduce bpos for everything from those ground vehicles to pos towersthe low end bpos base commodities would give new pilots something to manufacture with their meagre mining efforts to npc or player buy orders and allow them to grow in ways other than early career mission grinding
lot of confusion in this thread about what is an isk sink and isk facet basically if isk goes to ccp its a sink if isk comes from ccp its a faceti support this conditionally its a bit more complex then just a yes or no only ccp knows the extent per day of the current isk sinksfacets one would assume any sinks lost would have to be replaced or facets reduced to compensatethe obvious solution is to increase the cost of skillbooks not sure if this would be enough to compensate maybe do away with items that are only npc traded ie made by npc and bought by npcso the condition attached to my yea vote is i would want to know from ccp what the options are if we do x we must also do y only then will i know for sure if its something i can supportinteresting side note this will buff null sec manufacturing operations the most which explains why so many csm members are supporting it which isnt to say buffing null sec manufacturing is a bad thing just saying lets not disguise this issue in good for everyone rhetoric
generally yes but  it would again give more power to those who control resources aka the big alliances and weaken the smaller corporation and alliances unless it is ensured that those items can be produced from generally and abundantly available resources
an interesting idea but imo you should still be able to see people who have set you blue or are in your corpalliancemilitia otherwise it will be a big mess
supportedi just lost and apocalypse and did not even get a lossmail
purpose to steamline ui and avoid irritating warningerror messagesproposal whenever your action would be stopped because something wasnt packaged ie stacking or selling of a module automatically package that thing and continue with the action obviously insured ships should give a warning however uninsured ships should give no warningedit there are a bunch of ways to do this in terms of settings dont ask me again etc etc im not proposing a solution here just the issue that needs to be addressed and the final result of whatever solution is chosenif this proposal is somehow misguided from a gaming perspective not an rp perspective please explain how
why should uninsured ships not give the same warning there are potentially irrevocable consequences involved in packaging any ship whether its insured or not you have heard of rigs rightnot supported
this is solid reasoning im sorry unrigged uninsured ships then basically any situation in which there will not be potentially irrevocable consequences im irritated with the ui but i dont have a ton of experience in knowing the fine details here and i cant edit the post any more i think in principle if we get a bunch of thumbs the csm guys will be smart enough to say just dont do this to ships or something whatevers good for the community
assuming that this actually works like you hope it does i think id be happy to see this happen so yeah ill support
so if i say stack all my stuff to pile together a few minerals and components all the containers would disgorge what is inside and repackage argh 3000 bpc sort and put away again the fitted but nor riggedinsured ships would repackage and drop all the modules and ammunitions in the hangar all the used crystal would send a message of you cant repackage this item and so onsorry interesting idea but it would cause more trouble that it is worth
limit to items that are not containers or ships
yeah i would like this option
 please keep the discussion civil and constructive thanks  ccp ildoge
so basically you want to make missioning in lowsec even more suicidal
my declaration of shame was no understatement quite obviously and your reply is again useless and pointless and still completely off topic but what do i know after all my post average is 2 per year lets say whilst you for example drake post something like 5 times a day again acceleration gates are a burden a simple fix is to allow players to bookmark and warp once they cleared the room you dont want mwds but you dont want mwds because you have a problem with salvaging not with the missions so why hijacking the thread if not for egocentrical stupid reasons only an imbecile would not agree that an increase in graphical quality and effects would affect the community positively as a whole simple 2d particles and effects would be a great addition to make fights more visually appeasing so that the game is more attractive to new players as wellagain please refrain from writing stupidities its ridiculous that theres not even support for the graphical additions
proposal is unclear and needs further explanationwhat happens if pockets 14 are clear and guy warps to a probed or fleeted mission runner in pocket 5 will he arrive at pocket 1s gate or at pocket 4s gate in the latter case that will make it hell for fleeted salvagers in the former case it has no effectits a nerf to mission isk income if it prevents friendly salvagers entering the gate chain from the start so you have to choose when you warp to a guy if you warp to him or his first gate explain how this will work massive boost to griefing of mission runners this doesnt really benefit mission runners the majority of which use ravens and drakes that have no good reason to fit an mwd and a lot of reason not to ravens capacitor problems plus the fact that even drakes have 60km missile range it would hugely benefit people entering missions with pvpfitted combat ships eg ninjasnice idea adding graphics is always good
thanks for the sound replyfor starters i understand the objection of mwd usage but if ninjas or pirates can use it you can too i might not completely grasp the consequences but my opinion is that itd be not much different from now if youre fitted for pve youll be in a sad spot against pvp regardless in any manner id expect to be able to use mwds simply if thered be no modification to the sad current state of acceleration gates access and fruitionin particular my idea is that letting aside scifi once you clear a room there are already interrupts for this mission side since many gates are unusable if you dont kill all enemies that rooms space becomes bookmarkable of course if you dont bookmark you warp to the first gate as usualfurther analizing my friends woes however i believe that itd be even better if you could bookmark the last mission room youve been into since this would allow you to experiment with various tactics and approaches thus allowing more variety and fun consequently
i dont have a gameplay problem with allowing a mission runner to warp back to his current room it wont cause the jeremy tacs problem where griefers can shortcut to the final objective and steal iti am indifferent to mwds in missions but the fact is that the current missile based ravenhull mission fits simply dont benefit from an mwd and pvp does now that i think about it there are a few mission fits that might benefit from an mwd for example ham tengu or sentry dominixalso there arent many missions with long gate travel and in most cases it takes about as long to kill the npc as it does to reach the gateoverall i dont care either way for either but you need to be aware that adding mwds in missions is a huge change the likes of which probably tips balance away from missioners
you started off ok but then began calling people names for not agreeing if gates cause people like you to leave the game then id like to make a counter proposal that we add more gatessupporting adding more gates to get rid of people like youinappropriate comments removedsteviesg
not supportedacceleration gates are used to set up certain tactical circumstances which might be broken by bookmarks as well as to reduce the ease with which mission runners get scanned down besides there are very strong lore reasons why acceleration gates cannot be skipped other posters have covered this in greater detailmicrowarpdrives would allow for speed tanking which i imagine ccp would like to discourage as it would greatly influence how players run missions it would also greatly improve the ability of suicide gankers lowsec pirates and ninja looters to get to youcurrent graphics tend to be optimized for performance which is a major concern in a game with thousandman fleet fights what you suggest could negatively impact this especially if the server has to keep track of littered shell casings
what does my posting habbits have to do with anythingyour in an npc corporation that or faction war npc your toon is little over a year old and you treat me like some childobviously you only read what you want if thats the case were done hereand just in case you attack me like you did to venkul whose been playing since 2006 if not 2005ive been playing for over 2 years if not just under im no expert but at least im getting somewhere and learning a lot out in 00 space ive done the mission gig ive been the victim of ninja salvaging invasions war decs all kinds of things anyone with common sense would see your proposal is swiss cheese i participate in these forums frequently because i have a passion for the game and an abhorrence for foolish ideas i am entitled to my opinion just as much as you aretired of thread hijacking knock off the insults and you just might get somewhere
it has to do with everything youre writtenyawn go troll somewhere else please
this exactly i have now lost all respect for the original poster
most certainly not with some of the backgrounds out there even the white activity circle can be lost in the miasma of likehued contrasts pair that with minor color blindness and you get a complete question mark when it comes to whats running and whats noti agree that there needs to be some method to make modules appear more readily active against all contrast levels or even simply putting a black area behind them not widescreen letterboxing for improved visibility
true i generally position my camera solely to keep all that blinding bright stuff out of my field of view so thats not much of an issue for me but i can see how it would be to someone who actually tries to position their camera to see things okay ill support it
yes please
im 51 in real live and my eyesight is slowly deteriorating i would very much appreciate some more distinguishing icons and not only for activeinactive modules
yes please some of those system backgrounds are just too bright to see the white activity circle
sorry guys times are a bit busy for me atm ill work on this soon again write responses to the comments and update the op with those that make sense to methanks all for the support so far
approved
i support it fully and this guy has a good idea of how to do it
id wait until the rockets fix before saying that the ship itself is broken its dps is actually comparable to sabres even now and it doesnt really have the grid for seven turrets anyways
so youre asking for a remote salvaging device with a range of possibly over 120km thats ludicrousespecially considering that the salvager takes a high slot this would make many ships entirely too powerful drake with missiles for damage and salvage drones so it doesnt even have to moveim sorry but they were right to remove salvager drones from the equation completely the salvager is limited in that it requires a high slot a good amount of cpu and only has a 5km range adding drones to that task would mean almost nobody would equip the actual salvagerssorry i cant support this
go to the wreck at 120 km at mdw speed 5000 ms return at loaded speed 200 ms total 624 seconds really overpowered
i was thinking of a technical solution to the problem not ccps deliberate encouragement of asshattery as a profession
after recalculating the math i realize that the drone wouldnt necessarily be fast however it would seem to have too few disadvantages compared to the highslot salvager unless there was a way to balance it so the salvager isnt deprecated im still against the idea
the ship makes it there in 500 seconds the drone takes 624and of course bookmarking docking up and getting a destroyer takes less than 200 the ship can take in a whole cluster of wrecks the drones have to do each one individually the ships can loot the drones can only salvage and in order to get up to 120km you need to dedicate a minimum of three high slots to drone range extension which is actually a fair bit harder to fit than a traditional salvage fit i dont believe that salvage drones are necessary or particularly wise i dont like turning a collectable into a commodity and messing up the people who are holding the books either but the arguments you raise really arent very good ones
alot of people seem to think thay would be to over powered due to range ect well there is a simple fix that is to limit there range to say 5060km and 4000mswith max drone range sills for those of you who dont know a marauders tractor range is already 40km then to give reason for the shorter range and speed have some kind of tech babble in the description for ex due to the installation of a salvage device and increased cargo hold the control receiver and propulsion systems had to be reduced limiting this drones operational range and speed when compared to other drone types or something along those linestho i do support topic and hope ccp can figure out a way for them to work
no not because that this would be a bad idea i myself am a drone user with nearly 10mil sp in drones but because i generally dont like features which support and assist solo play meaning playing with as less interaction with other players as possible with none at all the best eve is a mmorpg or at least should be not a solo pcgame
ok i accept your position even if i dont totally agree sorry for the heavy sarcasm in my reply the balance is strongly dependant on the drone size and chance of successi see them as a 10 m3 drones with a decent capacity one of the problems will be the volume of the salvage several bs even if the salvage really dropped has a small volume have a potential maximum volume of salvage over 100 m3 and for the salvager to work the ship must have 100 or more m3 free for dedicated use it could be even possible to have 3 size of drones with different maximum cargo capacity small for frigatedestroyer wrecks medium for cruiserbc large for bs and above naturally that would require a way to identify the different wreck size without the need to memorize the name of all different npchonestly probably too much work for a small gainthe option of a tractor drone as suggested above seem simpler again with speed limitations when loaded
this only applies to empire faction and mission generic wrecks it doesnt apply to normal npc wrecks which dont ever drop scrap metalsalvage uses up 001m3unit regardless of typeyou can send one drone to each wreck individually and could technically have a tagalong alt in a vexor carrying dps drones for when theres ships about and salvager drones for when there arent with nothing but drone link augmentors in its highs and a bufferresists in its lows with rr on the missionrunners ship he doesnt need to run his local tank while his alt is the one getting shot at so capstability is between a nonissue and of little enough consequence that its not valid in the argumentnow if we instead look back to the guy that uses one account he can warp on in afterwards the way he would in his thrasher in a vexor that can still achieve 175kms with a 6s agility using a mwd allowing it to quickly and efficiently nip around sending 5x salvager drones after wrecks further away while it deals with 5x wrecks closer to its own location it even gets to lock all of those wrecks provided the pilot has trained targeting lvl5 and multitasking a bit and is using signal amplifier iis in its lowsthe vexor even has a 480m3 cargohold allowing it to hold a fair chunk of the morevaluable loot it just wont get to fit salvage tackle this way destroyer can or tractor things around destroyer can again but then youre already talking about using a drone that wouldnt benefit from salvage tackle that would need its own skill to use and that will not loot for youso on the whole a salvage drone looks like nothing but a fluffaddition that will either be useless overpowered or limited to the point of frustration for a large portion of the playerbasedemonstrate to me why this kind of addition is necessary

the background for this is that a while ago i was considering putting training on hold with my main to avoid having to move to the next grade of clone simply because it would double the cost of clone upgrade when inevitable poddings occur it seems to me that the costs of clones is too high and with little reasoneve is not a game where more skillpoints  much greater power just as larger ships are not in all situations better than smaller ships after a certain point one trains more skills to diversify ones abilities not to become better at a particular area a character with 10mil sp can be as good an interceptor pilot as one with 100mil but the character with 100mil sp has to pay the cost of an interceptor for a new clone every time she is poddedthere are arguments against changing the costs of course one is that if one cant afford to lose a pod dont undock this is true but it does restrict significant proportions of gameplay fleet interdiction involves almost certain podding as to a lesser extent does any largescale fleet action where lag often means that one has died and been podded before ones client even registers the first loss of shieldsthat any character sufficiently invested in the game to have 70mil sp should have more than enough money to pay seems to be another however iskhour earning is related far less to the number of skillpoints a character has than to many other factors after one reaches a certain level in a particular area many of the isk sources in eve are only slightly affected by additional skills l4 missions may be run slightly faster by a character with skills for a marauder but the iskhour difference will not be that different to a much lowerskilled character running missions in a cnri would suggest that the cost of medical clones should be capped at 01isksp or 100k per million skillpoints current costs are listed at
i know that this will probably be part of a broader fix of pos mechanicsshould that glorious day ever come but on the chance that this can be fixed with a smaller patch than would be necessary to fix the pos system entirely ill propose this as a separate change current situation when a pos tower has less than 24 hours of fuel left all directors get a notification that looks like the followinga followup notification is sent every hour until the tower is either refuelled above 24h or offline other than in these mails fuel status can be checked by going to the tower in person or via api api gives only fuel levels while looking in person shows consumption rates there is a page in the corporate assets window for pos structures but no ability to check fuel levels there nor even any ability to tell which structures are attached to which tower proposed change the corp assets in space page will be changed significantly towers will get a location listedsystemmoon instead of just system and there will be a fuel remaining column for towers  a single number which can be rightclicked to give a full status report like you get from being physically at the tower now in addition to the lists of structures grouped by system there will also be a group of lowfuel towers so that they can all be seen at a glance starbase fuel technicians will not be able to see the full list of structuresfor security but they will be able to see the lowfuel list fuel notifications will be changed from hourly to there being only two  one at 24 hours one at 6 hours these fuelmails will be sent to starbase equipment managers and starbase fuel technicians in addition to directors and will contain information on consumption rates and time remaining for all fuels sorted by time remaining benefits it would make the godawful process of fuelling pos towers at least 20 less painful and lower spam significantly reduced notifications will also have a slight benefit as regards server load drawbacks more information provided will generally mean more server load its not known whether this will outweigh the reductions from fewer notifications
it is a pain in the butt currently to figure out exactly how much fuel a tower needs especially if its quite a few jumps away

please 
i think suicide ganking is coolwhat id like to see is only paying accounts be able to fire at protected targets in high sec thoughit sucks that people make bull accounts for this purpose let them eat the training time on a paid account imomight have a sideeffect of making the game more newb friendly by protecting them from concording themselves during trial period
i will go with this not only will it stop insurance jobs in hisec but hopefully make suicide gankers atleast think twice or maybe once before popping someone
removing insurance will make little change to gankingbefore you say i am mad heres whya fitted gank cruiser without insurance would be 8 million isk lost it needs 16 million cargo in an industrial for that cruiser to pay but because of the sec status loss and the 15 minute countdown the threshold for ganking them is already 50 or 100 million so theres no change there a fitted gank destroyer is 1 million isk to buy and another 1 million isk for modules thats a 2 million isk loss with no insurance 6 pilots paying 2 million each for destroyers can gank a hulk one pilot can pay 2 million to kill a covetor even the covetor pilot will lose more than that strip miners are over 1 million each 2 million isk thats 4 rat bounties i just did a mission that paid 20 million id pay 2 million in an instant to see the rage in local chati dont need to buy plex but even if i had to id pay usd 15 to do it 120 times put a coin in the box random emo ragequit chat comes out other side 1 in 10 makes you laugh your ass off at 10 cents per go its cheaper than cable tvpeople saying suicide gankers are exploiting insurance might have a point but fixing that wont stop the ganking in fact i dont think it will reduce at allif you want to change something to fix ganking increase the sec status loss its still possible to gank with outlaw status but its much more troublesome as you cant sit on a high sec gate all day
i could support removing insurance payout from concorded ships if your willing to budge on the whole concord issue concords response time especially concord has been buffed so many times its ridiculous if the trend continues suicide ganking freighters or other large ships wont even be possible its already impractical you need a lot of ppl good timing between you and a 5 or 6 system
i figure a very large proportion of the people falling victim to suicide ganking could avoid it by making their own risk vs reward assessmentshould i fly this t2 bpo in an afk shuttle or an actively piloted and cloaked t2 haulershould i fit a tank in my hulk mid slotsshould i be at my pc while my mining lasers cycle and actively align to a stationgatesafespot or maybe watch tv and sit at zero speedshould i expect to make isk without risk or maybe stop being lazythe mechanics are there already and vastly reduce the risk of you falling victim to a suicide gank if indeed you choose to use them
thread requesting the modification of insurance to payout based on the completed sell orders for each ships specific basket of mineralsthreadif the basket price were calculated using weekly averages weekly it would be basically impossible for anyone to game the system because of the vast size of the minerals marketstill wouldnt stop suicide ganking because the base prices for minerals would drop without the artificial support provided by insurance as a floor to pricesin effect making mining even less profitable way to suicide gank yourselves guysedited for thread linky
its not to remove suicide ganking this is only to make it a genuine risk vs reward type of thingthats all insurance should not be paid out for being concorddokkendthats it make it so its an actual risk and you are gambling isk and security status carebears shouldnt be safe not by any means but at the same time you can churn out alts in your accounts you get 2 other than your main and have them ready to suicide and dispose of thats not even having multiple accounts which im positive like 20 of people doif you guys are clueless how easy it is to pop someone in a t1 hauler carrying anything above 50million in value then thats your issue but at present it provides to be a no brainer to make tons of isk with no lossand before anyone says anything else dumb no i didnt get popped to make this thread i just am tired of seeing folks profit from norisk insurance scams that often times just prey on newbies because as i just said no riskmost billionairesveterans are flying t2 haulers or freighters like myself and there is risk in hitting us
as with any nerf that happens in eve its disapointing for those of us used to a certain setup but we get over it eventualy and with all the nerfs ive always wonderd why take away  why not add stuff for other ships instead understandably the complications for the programers would be higher but not unobtainable the same i could say for all bpos the market is a joke and has been for years they added t2 to make a change  then made t2 invention a great thing in my books but it still is not the backbone of eve t1 ships still cost less and work fine for the most part but they too cost more to build than you can get them on the marketwtf a easy fix would be to create classes of players by adding skills requierd for all bpos each one a diff skill set in doing this the t2 bpo owners inventors would have to spec more skills in the field they want to build the pirates and mission runners would have to cross train skills in order to build there own ammoships etc or just keep training the pvp skills and buy all there ammoships each factions skills spec could vary so as to create more competition granted this will only be a temp fix for the market but over time they could make t2 bpos break down and slowly become unusable while at the same time introducing more bpc drops for the t3 ships this will however help the separation of the classes and i think make eve more ballanced for everyone ive always said you can build a bs with a one day old account if given the stuff to do it with  thats comparable to me going into my back yard with a shovel  digging up some dirt  bringing it inside and building a ford or a kia and if i read a few books for 3 months i could build a ferrari so for ccp to do us all a favour i say add more skills for building and have the t2 bpos break down at a random pace so one day all that will be left is a bpo thats a collectors item and is unusable if not then have the invention have a randomness that can include perfect runs and with the chance of a perfect me with up to 20 builds regardless of what you put in but improving if you add the various items or item quality
i am a relatively new player a bit over a year playing and i own t2 bposjust saying its possible they are out there new players can buy themnot supported though i do support a reasonable balance between invention and t2 bpo production im not convinced at this point theres a problem
the t2 lottery was one of the worst mistakes of ccp and is still massively affecting the game they need to be removed change all of them to max run bpcs with the max run number of their t1 equivalents brace the shoulders to let the bpoowner whines run over you and get rid of those artifacts they are not needed any more at all dis balance the economy to the favor of a few who are mostly already beyond rich and can be replaced by invention without any loss to the supply of the eve community a strong yes from my side
when you start in eve and learn about the t2 lottery and the bpos it makes you angry that you missed out and that likely you cant afford the hundreds of millions or billions that these bpos soldsell forafter you learn more about the game and invention especially if you actually do it you understand that while bpo holders dont have to do all the invention bs if they dont want as an inventor your manufacturing is more flexible and adaptive to the market you can stock up your invented bpcs for a batch job while still inventing more bpcs ofthe same thing or another they are stuck making that one thing over and over trying to recoup the costs with buying it or just printing isk so to speak if they actually won the lottery if they are smart they are also inventing as unless someone has several t2 bpo they cant capitalize on the market an inventor can by being flexible i dont have to make the t2 item if i dont want to i can sit on the bpc where a t2 bpo holder has to make it and sell it to make isk or they are wasting time sitting on it whether they are not producing or copying it im not doing that sitting on a bpc i can make it and sell it or sit on it while i make other bpcs the time involved in copying a t2 bpo makes it less profitable than just making the item unless they a reason to take that losstldr get over t2 bpos someday ccp might want to listen to some players and turn them into limited production bpcs but it really isnt needed inventors can and do make isk they have more options to produce and arent stuck paying off a loan in the form of a expensive bpo they purchased by having to produce from it for years constantly i hold not t2 bpos and wouldnt buy one ever cause it is a waste of isk

eve audio is broken point blanklets look into getting it working and then separate out the important alerts voice et al from the dross
sounds like a very useful change to eves audio supported
some dev already mentioned that it is not likely to happen due to technical issues but i am this supporting this because it would be a very useful addition
supported audio et all needs to be redone
i actually didnt mean the starmap but the assets window today it shows the stationsystem and number of jumps to that system while i though it would be handy to see if one have a planned route through that system in that window
if you order your assets window by number of jumps you can check it while you are aligning and see if there is anything close by to pick up
hmm interesting on one hand a bit more in your face but on the other hand i can see it confusing people not sure how i feel about that one tbh beyond my usual something buried in an options menu cant hurt anyone too badly
as most people i always do what if you were given an option not to show number of jumps but number of jumps from current route i mean if you have stuff at 100 stations across a region hrm could happen it would be a very valuable too to assess if a deviation from the current route would be smart or not
i like your idea  greygal
might still be too early but really ccp needs to at least consider this problemmany fps games are being built released and then the developers are discovering their engine cant support dedicated serversthis needs to be sorted out before releasewithout dedicated servers there is no reason to buy the game if you dont live in mainland eu or us
first they have to know that enough australians will buy the gamethere is no point in setting up local servers if the people using them dont cover the costs
would be nice to have more info on dust514 generally but definitely including this
if thats how it works given its a console game there is every chance that it will be p2p game hosting with achievements to a central serverthis is a really poor quality of game upstream bandwidth is near nonexistent on adsl connectionsthus it would be nice if they think about this now rather then after release when its impossible to change and reassure us that the game will be playable for noneuus citizensofp2 went from a top seller to a completely dead game within the space of 23 weeks due to this oversight
if you want to get a basic picture of how dust 514 will work regarding servers etc pay attention to mag on ps3 it may not have all the persistent elements of dust or even the customisation but its running 256 players per battle supposedly and some of the mechanics are similar to what i suspect dust will be likealso expecting a game which is both persistent and will supporthopefully 100 player battles to run p2p or on player run dedicated serverswhich completely negates the main reason for running fps games on consoles  anticheat security is asking for disappointment
unless you limit the group of people playing together to a certain geographical area it wont help latency much to place servers in each continent someone would always be far awayon the other hand since youre playing the fps with a joypad instead of a mouse latency is a minor issue sarcasm
i think you should be able to chose from a color template what color you want you hull and lights to be this will help give people diversity
sorry to whine but id really like the mission view windows in my agent conversations to stop closing every time i dock or undock strangely most of the level 1 missions dont do it but the level 2 and higher ones doin fact i just noticed that a agent convo window that i had left open while doing a mission actually shrank back to one pane when i completed the objectivethis is really silly and i hate having to click view mission constantly
actually every kind of skilllevel development in mmo is totally useless and actually unfair especially for those who do not use botscheats and exploit game mechanics to fullest to grind skillslevels or whatsoever in most efficient wayeve skill system is fairest thing ive seen in any mmo rpg this far because it does not require grinding or anything stupid like that instead its more about learning how to use the stuff you have and get isk etcmmos should focus more on collecting items and learning how to use the skills you already have in effective way instead of bashing same dumb monster 247 actually in my opinion modern mmo would not have any skilllevel development at all you would just pick basic stats you start with and stick with them
less than ten days away and this is the response thats been attractedsad and of course no update of the initial post to show what has actually made it to the agendaafter this meeting can we get a short reprise of whats going to be brought to iceland for direct review by ccp in what february
final agenda only gets posted just before the meeting and if you feel that theres a lack of response go generate some 
back to the top support this people 
have a discussion thread here about this as well
why would you give hybrid boni to a scorpion hull
bo need a boost maybe double the jumprange to 9 ly on jdc5 give them a hp buff and review the t2 resists on them and make them able to lock onto cyno generators and normal cynos
black ops ships were really cool when the idea came out but ccp nerved them to oblivion the role they were assigned to cannot be fulfilled by them and for any other use they are too weak and too expensive pity really and no wonder that more titans are flown in game than black ops shipsdo anything to them regardless what what gives them a use and a purpose based on their cyno and jump capabilities ewar is one of the ideas for instance or something completely new and unique like the ability to cloak during a fight or something anything or remove them from the game totally keep those abominations out of our sight
i tend to agree with you blaster boats could be a low range averagetracking dps monster and fill a good niche role utilizing tackle and approach to reduce transversal and apply signficanlty more dps at short range minmatar have a wide range variety that they function at better performance inside tracking of other races or outside range of gallentein shortrange weapon engagementsminmatar would win the fastorbiting short range fightsamarr win the medium range slugfestsgallente rip things apart if they get up close and control movementthey do need more than the current 10 difference though and the ability to fit a bit more tank or a faster base speed id lean toward the latter itd take a lot of playtesting to determine the magic numbers but having 20 better base damage than other races and more inertia but significantly more thrust might be an interesting direction to go they can get within range faster but still require significant tackling to keep minmatar from outmaneuvering them while amarr still try to kite and kill on approachpersonally i think most of the amarr op cries are due to the tracking of pulses and reducing that a bit to give us worse shortrange dps against fast targets might be warranted but the mid range dps with scorch and a lowheavy slot layout are the only selling points of the whole amarr fleet no ammo for structure bashing is kinda nice too but not extremely important in the long run if you take that away then the whole race is uselesslaser ships do have some disadvantages but i think the biggest difference is that all of ours tend to have the same solution bring other ships to the fight too while the issues of blaster boats more travel time and shorter range are only magnified as the number of ships involved in the fight increases gallente do make significantly better solo ships than amarr the curse being an exception but amarr make better fleet ships armor tanked t2 minmatar ships laugh at you and your pathetic attempts to damage them with emtherm t1 amarr ships are mostly onetrick ponies with the same trick they have good widerange dps and good tank but no real utility or variation beyond gankfocused tankfocused or both but hard to fit amarr ships have very few midslots most cant tackle for themselves and still operate a prop mod for any significant time period or larger ships have to drop the useful sensor booster amarr ships are generally quite slow since we cant ever get away with a dcii instead of a plate mostly relevant on subbs ships amarr ships often have little dronebay space nothing resembling useful ewar outside the curse gallente cant claim much better ewar but it is better long range weapons are useful too and come with the race selection package fly more with larger groups and youll see more megathrons out on the field though i think apocs still usually outnumber them cap bonus instead of combat bonus on many shipslaser ships have disadvantages over hybrid ships please stop taking a turret away from its ship layouts and bonuses unless youre also going to say that nothing in eve can successfully fit lasers because they suck your hurricanedrake cap dry in seconds blasters need a buff but if you take scorch  long range pulses out of the picture then amarr are going to need a base dps boost to make up for the massive loss of effective range and then we would be stepping on your toes even more
all of the below assumes it is a small engagement 3 or less on each side blasters and autos are not fleet weapons and pulses rule medium gang warfare 510 on each side when used in quantity long range weapons are more useful for anything largeri dont think tracking vs other long range weapons is the problem you can easily run under the guns of any long range weapon system without running under your own if you cant pull this off just keep reminding youself that you dont need to run at full speed at all timesfor short range guns it doesnt matter if you do your max dps unless unless youll cap out before they die otherwise if you are doing more dps at a given range than they are then you are winning the dps portion of the fight if you are fighting amarr run in close and take the tracking penalty because it will hurt them much more than you sadly minmatar autos have comparable range and better tracking than you so reduce your transversal as much as possible and try to stay within your range so you can apply more dps than their autosas an amarr pilot i seldom orbit unless im facing someone with larger than me or with long range weapons i either keep at range or start running away immediately otherwise ill hurt myself more than himher i havent used blasters since prermr days so i cant say they arearent balanced but i hate it when people complain that i cant click on orbit at my optimal and kill stuff like the other ship isnt supposed to shoot backthe lachesis is a very special case in that its ewar puts it in a very spoecific band of ranges close enough to disrupt and far enough to be untargetable where lasers hit perfectly the ferox gets a range bonus no damage bonus and a tank bonus a set of bonuses that are generaly associated with a large fleet ship which it would perform better at if it were an armor tank
no it does not ffs it occupies an low slot which would otherwise be used in armor tank with shield it occupies a low slow that would not otherwise be used in shield its a bonus slot to all shield tankers are you stupid 
based on his above posts i think yes
ummno what i did was use argument in absurdam to point out flaws in the post i was replying to stating that boosting damage to be pan weapon system  to saying that all weapon systems should be nerfedamusingly enough both seperate iterations have been used by the op and those that agree with him in this thread the point you take issue with is necessarily absurd and the absurdity is why you take issue with it in any case i dont care about drone damage in the slightest and its not what were arguing aboutwhat we are talking about by contrast is a hamfisted and ill thought out attempt to fix the caldari by boosting something that aint broken hoping it somehow fixes the actual problems the caldari have
okay this is an issue with caldarimissiles i have griped about for years and years and no one has really supported it im glad you made this post because missiles in their current state are boring and borderline brokencaldari ships should get a bonus to all missiles because missiles are missiles you shouldnt be stuck using 1 type of missile to get your bonuses thats just stupid it makes all other missile types generally undesirable whats the point of having 4 types of missiles when the missile race gets a bonus to only 1 of themlets racially diversify missiles similar to drones kinetic should be the top end missile in terms of pure dps probably followed by amarr khanid of course then probably minmatargallente could even tweak stuff like explosive velocity explosive radius velocity racially but for overall dps i would make the kinetic missile king just the equivalent of thermal drones for gallente i would like to see missiles be based on mostly kinetic damage with some of the other damage types mixed in honestly i would rather say a missiles damage would be mostly kinetic based that would make switching missiles useful but still for the most part the missile is delivering kinetic damage thus ensuring caldari ships are racially inclined to dealing kinetic damage maybe 6040 ratio kineticother typei also wouldnt mind seeing missiles do more alpha damage with a slower rate of fire to compensate since missiles generally do take up more cargo space than ammo annnd last but not least just to really gripe it up here i wish missiles would get better effects the whole shooting 1 blob of glowing crap out of your ship from the same spot gets kinda old i wish missiles looked cooler seems like every other weapon in the game got effects upgrades so why not missiles
the mere fact that nobody uses caldari ships other than the drake for pvp and only because it has an amazing tank  albeit a shieldtank at that should be an exceptionally vivid example of why the hull bonuses need to be changedi dont want to come off sounding like a buff my race pilot here so i will try to explain my position the fact is being able to switch ammo types is not enoughfirst caldari ships are some of the slowest ships in the gamecaldari ships tend to have the smallest drone bayscaldari ships also tend to have the weakest armor tanks of any of the ships in the gamethis is fine they dont have to worry about tracking problems being disrupted being out of range not in most situations anyways and they will always hit their target with at least a fraction of the potential damage while in rangeso having the advantage of switching out ammo types seems like a bonus but it is not changing damage types to aim for the resistance holes especially in small gang and solo pvp means you are sacrificing hull bonuses as well as thousands of damage points inflicted while your weapons load amarr dont have this problem switching crystals and minmatar pilots have the advantage of being able to maneuver themselves out of bad tactical situations while gallente ships can fall back on drones that have incredible range on top of this one of the reasons behind flying caldari ships is that they dont necessarily need to be outfitted for a specific optimal range whereas minmatar and gallente ships are and when something cannot be engaged in favorable tactical situations it simply isntcaldari ships should not have to avoid engagement because of the fact that they will first have to worry about the dropped hull bonuses and then later a massive loss in continuous dps while you reload to an ammo type that helps you ravage the resistance holes in your adversary on the contrary the sheer loss in damage dealt while ammo types are switched out will more than make up for the increase in damage you do using the new ammo type minus the hull bonus i would heartily say rof bonuses need to be given
way back in the day the thorax and i think maller got a third medium slot the caracal got shafted imo it really should have a third low slot the third slot would almost always have to go towards a fitting module anywaysand yeah nighthawk needs some grid

jim changing missile specs so that different types of missile damage makes different specs is a bad idea imoare you a dumb  of course caldari have the weakest armor they have the strongest shields thats like saying amarr should get their shields boosted because theyre so inferior to caldaris shieldsand youre complaining bout having to switch ammo and it taking time here are some other things that take time showing that caldari isnt the only one wasting timegallente ships trying to get into range to do any damage gallente ships changing ammo to hit far enough to do any damage amarr trying to move their plated to hell and trimarked ships aroundand if you did more damage with the kinetic missiles instead of changing to explosive to hit a resist hole then just stay with kinetic youre even bonused to it for gods sake you just said that it was fine as it is unless you know youre going up against a particular hole just keep kinetic in and youd do more damage anyways if minmatar wants to change to hit a resist hole they have to wait 10 seconds too welcome to the club
i think it would make missiles more interesting personally but to each their ownthe only problem here is that though caldari by far do have the best shields in the game a huge flaw in the game right now is that 3 races ships are mostly armor based and only 1 race is shieldcentric which is kind of annoying for rr i never did like the whole shield tanking vs armor tanking thing i have to wonder why amarr ships have shields at all
a perfectly valid point ofc how will the ops propsition fix this

actually not a bad idea for ransoms only thing i can see wrong with this is that it becomes impossible to dishonour ransomsand instead of the pirate losing lock for 35 seconds player would have to become invulnerable for a small amount of time otherwise you just have your friend pirate hold him there and kill him after ransom is paid although that could be abused in fleet fights with allies ransoming each othermaybe make the ship invulnerable and the ship not be able to activate any none local modulesidk thatd have to be thought over
also to empire dweller since i cant quote 2 people at once so this is about his smartbomb rubbish toohere go the hisec emo boys if you read the post it is not about pirating you rich folk of hisec its about making lowsec a better playing environment for those who want to live there if you dont want risk dont go to lowsec it isnt as though hisec is smallalso i have never lit a smartbomb in my life ive never even fitted one check my corp on battleclinic if you like you will see it full of combat ships flown by combat organisations and they wont be in the losses section so please be quiet on this oneso can we have comments and ideas from the people who live in lowsec not the ones whod like to make it safe
ive got to say i really like some of the ideas hereever since ccp mentioned talk of a criminal underworld element being discussed ive allways thought that has to be lowsecthis in my opinion would become popularit would also offer a real feeling of being in dangerous spaceneeds discussion but supported
next people are going to demand that market buysell orders on inactive accounts automatically become paused and invisible on the marketim mixed on supporting or not supporting this but honestly considering the significant amount of work involved in gaining access to the worthwhile agents and the fact that if it were done on such a massive scale there would be an issue in datacore supplydemand ratios read there isnt theres such an excess of supply that 001isk order warfare is almost more common than that for tritaniumpyeriteas it stands while any given account is inactive farming the rp the owner cannot cash in the rp to get the datacores when he does someone or even a few people may do the same at roughly the same time and the two people will end up having reactivated a whole bunch of accounts they do nothing else with purely to flood an already saturated market with a commodity nobody needs to buy anymore because they either already have supplies of datacores from exploration that they cant sell off or they are doing the exact same thing anywayon the flipside this would hurt the lowerkey guys that are trying to farm rp for invention purposes rather than for directtrade purposes whether they intend to invent for personalcorpalliance use or to sell the end products to the market insteadso actually no i cant support this hurts the fatcats abusing the system at the same time as the startup players trying to find a viable means of making a bit of extra isk
uh no the fatcats abusing the system are the ones hurting the people trying to make some extra isk they are the ones who flood the stable market of players cashing in and selling datacores the people who log in once a year to collect datacores from x accounts hurt the people trying to make some isk from datacores but who actually play and supply them year round they are the ones who trade them to a main and can sell off their stockpile year round but are likely more motivated to take less cause their mains running out of game time having only paid to activate the account and collect the datacore their research point farmers go back to sleep until next time
and only the fatcats can do this rightif everyone can do it but some choose not to then thats not a flaw of gamemechanics its a human errorwhat do those accounts do when theyve been activated for a month only one character can train for 32 or so days before it becomes inactive again chances are good that the initial gametime investment to train all three characters on the account as well as grind standings byproxy for them took more than a 1month sub initially especially since the more characters are splitting up standings gains the more missions you have to run to get the personal standings then you still have to grind the faction standings element which is high for the lvl4 agents on the character itselfthose people had to work to get their various characters to be able to use that many research agents at once if they bought characters that could already do that then the person they bought the characters from had to work for it and isk is still changing hands in what i believe is a very alive market for rp generation characterswhy should this kind of limitation be imposed on purely inactive accounts someone may have two characters on their mains account that do nothing but purely this fair enough that account is paid for but thats two essentially inactive characters if they are used for purely rp grindingalternatively they could have this going on an account purely bred for afk mining with rp generation on the side or even just for an orca altwhy should other forms of afk play have it easy while this doesntand before you pull the you must be a fatcat card i have a grand total of two agents right now in amo and hek  i got too tired of the insanely mindnumbing grinding to get access to the agents after id already run hundreds of thousands in lp worth of missions for minmatar and never skipped a storyline mission and then still had to get those personal standings via lvl12 agents  there are other ways to make afk isk in eve that i prefer utilizing
because you cant afk mine on an inactive account pay for the account and you get three character slots to use for whatever you wish if someone wants to pay for 3 accounts with all 9 character generating maximal datacores they should be allowed to
and indeed they can if youre willing to train 9 different characters to grind datacores across 3 active accounts i have absolutely no issue with that as long as youre actually paying for those accounts to be run hell pay for them with plex i dont care but pay for them
again no i used your term fatcats because you used it as an argument that doing this would hurt the fatcats and the startup players trying to get into farming datacores for some extra isk as i said the little guy isnt the one setting up several dedicated accounts to farm datacores lets them go inactive then activates them when it is time to collect or they need to sell datacores to buy plex etc a little guy would more likely have their main do this and not do the unrealistic level 5 bs someone mentioned in this thread and grinding standings with the best lv4 rd agents out there because some extra isk doesnt require that kind of effort but i have no problem with someone wanting to keep rp farming accounts active it is the inactive collection of rp that is what needs to be fixedit is a flaw of game mechanics since it started why well ccp chose to not let players character benefit when the account isnt active benefit how in the collection or accumulation of things you can clearly see the parallel between a character continuing to train for a month and one that keep collecting research points the rp keep going forever it makes no sense where you character cant finish out the skill queue now what is the max 23 months on a skill but you can continue to collect research points for years if you so choose nothing else works like this in eve going on forever whether you are there or not or ever come back as far as those that worked to get their army of alt rp farming accounts up they took advantage of this game mechanic too bad it is long overdue that this was corrected ghost training imo was the catalyst for it they have been getting paid for their work what since t2 lottery ended i never said set the rp to 0 like someone suggested just stop it when the account is inactive some players chose to make characters grind standings and train skills for whatever time 23 months longer if they were really greedy so they could sit back and collect rp by doing nothing but paying for a month their choice not mine they can always sell them on the character bazaar nothing is stopping that activate the account post an ad collect datacores trade to main sell the character you got paid again for all your work why limit it to inactive accounts because they are gaining for nothing it is that simple the active accounts doing this pay for the game plex or real money on subscription you are free to kill your price checker alt contract scamming alt or forum alt and trade your rp farmer over to your main account as well or just sell it as an inventorfarmer comparing an alt on the same account to a secondary account that collects rp while that account isnt being paid for and the alt is makes no sense by that logic we should be paying for every alt we have on our main accounts as well 1 character per account brilliant i dont follow what you mean other forms of afk play have it easy while this doesnt what other afk play allows you to gain by not paying for the game for months and earn items worth isk maybe im too new the only thing i can think of is character farming but that has been nerfed as you need to keep the account active pay to train are you speaking of bottingmacroing those are against eula im for ccp stopping them too and feel they have a pretty easy way of finding them since most bots do it vigorously so it easy to profile and investigate those accounts
in light of a new year and a bump of the salvage discussion in the general forum i ll feel the need to bump this i havent heared yet that the csm took this up into one of their sheduled meetings though i might have missed itsong li as you posted here to bring it up please dont forget this d 
i support the following1 wrecks can be scanned down with a deep space scanner probe ie astrometrics v required to find wrecks2 wrecks can only be scanned down outside of deadspace areas inside they are not3 ideally id like an additional skill rank 45 to narrow down wrecks but i dont see it happening wo a special probe for this which id supportscanning down space salvage should be a more specialized profession and the rewards should have more hurdles to overcome not less while making it harder for everyone to scan out the wrecks as i suggest it distinguishes the professional salvager from the opportunist understand that once completed missions are turned in more salvage and loot will be readily available to anyone who trained the bare minimum to find it so more modulesreprocessed minerals and salvage on the market i think that should come with a cost of an extra skill to use a specialized probe in order to access this new bounty in space
i really dont see the issue with passive recharge youll get that with extra shield anyway it really is a non issuesurely this is about adding the hp boost when the bonus is applied of which i fully supporttwo things to remember also its not only the shield tankers that get the bonus and the recharge rate slows down from 33 upwardsex nyx pilot another char
recharge bonus  crap it doesnt amount to anything ever unless you are exclusively always passive recharge tanked but even then its annoying to have to wait every friggin time you change sessionehp  bonus is only good if you actually get itget itwait instead we can just do the same with armor  that will satisfy everyone including meoh and supported

it would have been helpful if youd explained what you are ranting about instead of just linking two threads edit  i thought it was that what you meant i agree these missions are illplaced and not really thought through
i can answer you this question ccp hates gallente they hate it so much that they dont even intend to hide it
supporteda truly bad idea to sneak this experiment inthe design of the game play here shows that the eve storyline board have no understanding of pveers or have taken on board any of their comments in the mission and complexes threadsshould have been put on the test server firstthe paucity of implementation shows that the csm can not have been consultedanother example of appalling ccp customer service
full support it was idiots who made these missions missions that do nothing but hurt gameplay ccp put no thought into it these missions what so ever a semi sensible way to do the missions world be to give the story agent a branching option mission 1 is the normal storyline empire missions branching option 2 is the low sec mission with a higher reward although the new low sec missions still need re making as they are so poorly thought outas a pve pilot i hate pvp hate being pushed into pvp situations and i hate risking pve ships in pvp hotzones we are pve pilots for a reason we dont do and often dont like pvp if i do these new stupid missions my standings drop below 2 and i can no longer fly with friends due to the caldari navy being after me i dont have that problem with normal missons

i do believe that lowsec is an important part of the game that some percentage of storyline missions are lowsec is an appropriate part of the gamepvp oriented players are fine w the innovation and i concur that pvp is an element of the game conversely would the pvp players be pleased with timeconsuming lowreward for unit of time trade missions flying huge payloads all over hells half acre in high secthat a new player learning the basics of skilling up and ship fitting should get a 13 jump l1 storyline combat mission with final jumps in a 03 and 02 system from an l1 agent is difficult that it should occur 4x in 4 weeks suggests poor implementation by the developers their own blog suggests strongly that this was a last minute addition to dominiona newbies missionfit frigate has no business in lowsec on a storyline let a willing newbie try out an appropriately fit lowcost frigate in low sec as she sees fitif not removed entirely these missions should at least be reviewed to determine if the frequency of assignment is appropriatealternatively reassigned to fw agentssupported

dust 514 for pc please 
this problembugfeature has been around for far too long would be great to finally see an overview filtering system that allows you to view just war targets or just hostiles or just neutrals or just friendlies
issue supported however the commentary on how to actually fix it was completely ignored by myself i dont care how ccp fixesimproves wts on overview as long as the just make it easiereffective
the best way i could see this working is just to have a toggle switch in the control tower which would just allow the guns to be unlocked to anybody in range of the tower or just remove guns from role permissions and use a password accessalso it would be useful if poss could be anchored for self or corp like warp disrupter bubbles to allow player freedom to put up a personal pos without the security risk of granting full rights to all the corporate pos operations
we complained that fw had been abandon by ccpso they gave us lp for pvpwe shut up and waited for the patchit turned out to be failso they dropped more candy on the floorproblem is all the candy has been lil things designed only to reduce complaintsat no stage has anyone taken a serious look at fixing fwagile scrum is neat and all but fw needs a permanent scrumgoing years without having a single developer assigned to this major part of the game is crazy
in what way do you demand in be done before dust fw and dust have nothing to do with each other so your statement makes no sense other than to say you somehow believe that the development of dust by a separate division is somehow impacting the eve devsis fw broken yeswill jumping up and down and attempting to give deadlines that dont have anything related to what youre demanding help noyour current proposal amounts to nothing more than fix it before you do x which is a useless proposal if presented to ccp you want it to actually mean something then put some actual timelines in there prioritize your ideas throw in a we want to see change a in 3 months b 3 months after etcand be realistic
supporting fw updates but timing in relation to dust is irrelevant

insurance needs to be reworked or elimintatedi dont think it is fair to the game for people to optimize loopholes and abuse it
its trivially obvious that ship insurance does provide a price floor minus a small percentage for production costs etc for the aggregate value of minerals since theres no real limit to the amount of minerals you can use this way if insurance was not bouying the price of minerals then the aggregate price would have to be higher than the insurance value since insurance is effectively an unlimited npc buy orderas the price of one mineral rises the others fall to compensate highend minerals have been depressed far below their base value for 2 years now for the simple reason that vast quantities of them are easily available from the rats in drone space the huge amounts of highends available in wspace didnt help prices either when i started playing back in 2006 zydrine and megacyte were a lot closer to their base values and ships typically sold for 1020 above net insurance value after the drone regions opened high end prices went in to free fall and t1 ship prices sank to insurance value never to rise more than 23 above it againthe facts are there for anyone to see
short and sweetthere are shortcut keys to have drones engage a target return and orbit and return to the drone bay but none to launch drones i propose that a shortcut option be added to launch dronesgreygal
wouldnt work since some people like carrier pilots carry many diffrent types how would the hot key know what ones to launch
so ive got a domi and its carrying five groups of drones  sentries heavies mediums lights and medium ecm which group does the shortcut launch and whyedit thinking about it a workaround presents itself have an option to select a drone group as defaultit can vary by ship ideally and have the shortcut launch that group its not all id want it to be but for a lot of ships itll do the trick nicely
good points  id forgetten about that  most of the time i carry just one type with me but there have been times when ive had several different types of drones with me and had to go through the folderfolders to select specific drones to launchwhile i really wanted to keep the idea simple perhaps it would be possible to add several basic generic launch shortcut keys  such as launch scouts launch heavies launch reppers im being very generic here sorryand suddenly a simple idea becomes more complicated sigh greygal
the current 24000byte limitation for forum signature images is pretty annoying i cant think of that many people on 56k modems browsing the forum with images enabled so shouldnt be any drawbacksso my proposal is to have this limitation changed to 75k byte so png will be a viable format for signaturesedit  to clarify the pixel limitation of 400x120 should stay as it is
supporting my own thread
what kind of graphic do you want to use if you need 75k for ithuge graphics tend to make a site unreadable because its constantly loading and resizing to adjust to a dozen signatures being loaded
if your connection is unable to handle a 75k image how do you view pronsupported increase the file size limitation but not the displayed pixel by pixel size this allows better quality sigs without cluttering up the screenand if its seriously a major issue for anyone in the broadband era they can use the handy function that turns of sigs
the fullsize version of my sig would be in the 6070k range as it is png and the only format supported by eveboardcom not to mention jpeg is pretty limited with no transparancy support
the 24000 byte limitation was ok when a greater proportion of internet connections were 56k and the forums did not have a function to omit signature images these days it is a nuisance and i fully support the limit being raised to 75k or 76000 bytes if eve mods dont want to memorise more than two significant digitsi do agree with the pixel size limit staying at 400 x 120 though
sounds reasonable  any 400x120 still image should be acceptable i dont want massive screenbreakers or gaudy moving gif files but standardsized sigs shouldnt be a problem
75k sounds like an adequate bump without overloading people left and righti would also not be opposed to an increase in visual size as long as it does not exceed 600 pixels in width and remains at the current height considering monitors are getting wider as a standard but not taller it makes sense especially considering most people play beyond the 800x screen resolutionedit for thumbsup
signedi have two different machines with different hardware and operating systems and both of them have little to no combat sounds i may hear my weapons fire 1 out of 50 times combat is boring without sound effects i also have a razer megalodon headset with its own sound card built in and this sound situation still happens every time i play eve so that means 3 sound cards and the same issue on either my desktop speakers laptop speakers or headphones1st machine has windows vista 64 ultimate with a sound blaster xfi music desktop2nd machine has windows 7 64 ultimate with realtek audio onboard sound alienware laptop
ill support any thread proposing fixing of the sound engineim not sure if its that the game overwhelms the sound channels or what but i multibox two accounts and if i have sound activated on both will regularly completely lose all sound for periods of combat with weapon the odd sound cutting through the silence occasionally zooming out has little effectthe other day i lost sound in one of my clients completely for several hours literally nothing came through combat station sounds nothing i tried disabling and reenabling sounds through the settings to no avail only logging and restarting eve fixed itfor reference i have had these problems on both my audigy 2 as well as the realtek built onto my p5b
i have already made my view on this clear poss are the most used isk sink in the game bar none they are staging areas protection ratting and mining poss logistics poss for cynos cyno gens jammers jump bridges t1 production t2 reactions t2 production t3 reactions and production base of operations research labs super capital construction yards they are more widely used and effect more people then any other one item in the game as without them there would be no t2 no t3no supercapitals longer lines for research then we have alreadyneedless to say they are used a lot and have a lot of uses to remove them as an isk sink would be removing what i view as the largest isk sink this game has however if we must allow them to be constructed instead of seeding bpos seed max run bpcs say 5 per bpc at the price of the tower itself so a large tower bpc would cost 350 mil x 5 or 175 billion and then the players themselves could play the value game with them and compete on the market to sell the towers for bpc cost  minerals  profit this would make towers cost more in the end but i can live with that
not supported song li you provide no information as to the actual implimentation of your suggestion all well and good for industialists to get new things to build and markets to explore but the ramifications of such across the board unless dealt with carefully could ruin the game for many playershow do you purpose ccp deal with seeding the new bpos how will the markets initially be affected what are the negative effects that will be experienced
massive fail by csm members song li and z0d in that they do not even know what an isk sink isremoving pos and associated fuel and modules from being an isk sink will be a bad thing for obvious reasons i like the well if you compensate for it it is ok posts the only realistic way to compensate for this is to put an npcsold element into every manufacturing job so that the isk sink is spread out over all items instead of in just a few itemswhile the above method is how other mmorpgs do it and has some merit as you could easily crank updown the isk sink as needed it would take quite a bit of work i dont see a pressing reason for a few new production opportunities when you already have thousands also it makes rp sense that amarr control towers are sold bythe amarrlack of understanding of very basic eve mechanics by csm members and wanting something without reason  no support whatsoever
supported but only for blueprint copiesgive them away in lp stores for lots of lp and isk
while i do like as many products as possible to be produced by players i am an even bigger fan in variation to how these products have to be producedin regard of pos consumables and other trade goods i am looking towards planetary interaction and seriously hoping that it will make an opportunity to produce those kind of itemsin regard to pos towers and buildings perhaps they too can be manufactured in their own special way with their own special restrictions instead of just slapping some common minerals and a blueprint together in a public manufacturing slot at a npc station
thats basically a good idea i like it but we really dont need yet another reason for people to do missions at the very least the tower bpcs should be low on lp and expensive on tags and isk

good idea if it does not make everything too complicated to implement the main thingwhen he fulfills his individual contract a pilot with 12 bounties on him will have 12 contracts on him and each one will be motivated by a collateral it there would be solution that one contract can be accepted by more then one bounty hunter then everyone would get the collateral back in the moment one of them would fulfill this particular contracttrue but necessary to avoid abuse of the system without it we would practically have the same situation as right now bounties would be collected by an own alt or a friendyes there should be some motivation to train a high rank skill based on unloved attributesa valid concern this might need some more thinkingand the praise for that does not got to me because that idea is not originally mine

i cant be the only one annyed with the probe launcher after you recall the probes and they dont end up in a single stack so when you hit reload a total of one probe get loaded in the launcheri can see two fixes for this either have the probes auto stack like salvage material when returned or have the launcher reload from multiple stacks
yup
go further than that add a autorepeat function similar to guns it is beyond moronic to have to click for every probe launched
supporting the original idea and the auto repeat option should be an option too
well ill support the idea  and not just because its my own idea the purpose of this thread is to have people speak up on a single fairly defined issue should plexingoccupancy have more value than it currently does a few of the fw threads have more than one thing they are trying to propose or are so vague like fix fw  whatever that might mean  that im not sure what people are acually supporting to my mind this is the most important question that needs to be answered because if it is answered in the negative then most fw pilots wont really care about all the other issues surrounding plexing  as they will continue to play as if the plexesoccupancy mechanic doesnt exist
not supported factional warfare is irretrievable the only solution is to shut down fw permanently
yeah this sounds rather silly im not sure what the solution is but it sounds like one is needed
it should not even be possible to wardec a fellow militia corp
hence why i love self destructcarbear tears are like beer and burgers yea its good but nothing truly special i can get those easy just gank the miners mercgriefer tears are like fine wine aged for hundreds of years served with a perfact cut of rare texas beef self destructing to deny a km is one of the few ways to extract them
bring a ship scanner and then type up the killmail its what kool kidz do
wouldnt it suffice that you get aselfdestructmailrather than a killmaili mean the game knows wether a ship is self destructed or killed and of course if it self destructs while under fire it becomes aselfdestruct induced by enemy fire thus allowing for that new special kind of killmailyou dont get the credit for the kill but you were involved in the ships destruction
for a corp member to be able to do a manufacturing job they are currently required to have factory manager rolethis gives them permission to cancel all corp jobsa corp should be able to setup so that members can start jobs as corp production without also having the ability to delete months of workseems rent factory slot does nothing in the postfactoryrenting setup
yes for sure there should be factory user and factory manager roleswith research folded in or split off ont care too much with the former only able to seecancel their own jobs

ive played the game for around 2 12 years not but recently started watching this forums in the time ive been playing insurance for t2 ships has always been based off of t1 chassis cost even though they cost upwards of 10 times as much could we adjust this payout to atleast pay something worth buying it for i realize t2 is always in flux cost wise but even a multiplier on the base cost for a more realistic reimbursment would be a step in the right direction any thoguhts on the matter or did this topic sail aong time ago
devs have clarified that t2 insurance payouts are where they want them to be
not to mention that the entire insurance mechanic needs a complete overhaul halfway measures will only make the problem worse
everytime someone asks for t2 insurance and that happens a lot its clear they have no clue right from the startinsurance is determined by base cost not market price write that down 100 times nao
he knows  hence the comment in the op about wanting it to be a multiplier on the base price not nearly the best solution but the problem isnt that he is unaware of the mechanics
seriously learn to read also base price us determined by marker on both t1 and t2 they are pretty static for t1 within reason but t2 is well off base to the point no one bothers insuring them overhaul the whole thing if you like but y insure a corvette when its payout is that of a chevette
insurance in eve should be abolished all together
the lack of adequate insurance coverage is the premium you pay for flying tech 2 you pay an extra premium in terms of your time by flying and dying in a tech 3 ship
not only would this be extremely awesome it would also make it easier to operate in stations without systemsespecially allowing 00 areas to not be dependent on empire trade routes makes this seem like an excellent idea to meonly problem would be if these poss would completely overtake the role of a station  a station is a large investment well it cost a lost of isk and seeing them exchanged by poss would probably make some people sad
when i think back over the time since dreads came into the game ive been in a number of fights where there were a large number of dreads on the field they almost always sucked hours of camping followed by a slide show where youre reduced to looking at killboards to try to figure out how the fights going and where the side with the best lagfu not necessarily the best skill or tactics winswith a system like this major engagements would still happen to takesave stations and friendlyhostile poses in the contested system because having those or depriving the other side of them would be tactically important theyd still matter a lot in the overall outcome of the battle they just wouldnt be the only thing that matteredi think that mechanics can be concieved to end the unplayable lagfest that sov warfare has been for a long time it just takes getting outside the biggest blob wins mentality and getting a little more creative
sorry to say this but you will never be able to stop blobs  thats what 00 warfare in eve is about bring more than your enemy or bring at least as much people which are better than your enemyskillexperiencewise
nah let them pay if you are that worried about increased medical cost there is already as you pointed out a built in mechanic to handle that situation just put training on hold you can always put the training into an alt at the same accout having two 50mill chars instead of one 100mill might prove to be more effective for you then in the long run
umwhat if youre finding the cost of your clone to be too much i suggest one of two things is happening1 youre ing people off and getting podded a lot or2 you fail at making any kind of reasonable incomeuntil you get past the sigma level 925 million skillpoints 20 million isk even a relatively young character approx 2  3 months old can make the cost of a clone inside a couple of hours of game play do you really lose your clone more than once every couple of hoursnot supported
i can make back the cost of a clone in about an hour ratting but flying an interdictor i can lose them at about that rate in a fleet fight i dont have the time to sit down and rat for the amount of time it takes me to earn back the cost of the interdictor and 20mil per clonethe argument about training up an alt makes sense from the current financial point of view but i think that is showing a problem with the current situation training an alt to do something completely different from ones main is one thing but training an alt to fly the same ships as ones main simply to avoid the cost of clones seems like a waste of training time
uhhthis isnt a problem rat more do less pvp if your so concerned build up some income
supported  there is no reason to fly smaller ships as the pod cost so much compared to the hull and those small ships are blown up easily then you get podded for whatever reasons
and the fitting often times costs so much compared to the hull too its almost as if the hull isnt the most important figure when determining costs of pvp
if these numbers are correct i cant be bothered to check then ops argument is pvp costs too much hence ccp needs to make it cheaper so he can pvpnolets use that number 92million sp if you cant figure a way to make the costs of your clones by the time you have played eve for 4 yearsgive or take with that many sp just sell your character and move on if you bought a character and the problem remains you need to do some eve research in to how to make isk if you dont have that sp you should still be able to make the costs of your clones as they wont cost 20mill a pop finally id like to add your corporationalliance is failing you as they should be helping you get rich if they arent and you are playing like a sod that dies for them i cant help you ccp cant help you noone can
this basically also even the cost of a 90m sp clone is heavily outweighed by even a pair of 4s and a couple of skill hardwiringsif youre going to argue that you only fly cheap t1 ships and that the clone is expensive in comparison well what do you need all those sp for then
i actually got caught by a smart bombing disco raven on a gate on my way back from jita a few days ago and podded i lost a total of a half billion in isk not counting the ship itself yes i had some expensive implants  sue me my clone on the other hand cost me about 3 million iskguess which expense i was not particularly worried aboutand before you even ask no i was not autopiloting i did a wtz and got caught while he was ganking something else unless he really wanted the 8 sisters core probes in my cheetahs cargo hold
from what i understand eve needs all the isksinks it can get while medical clones probably have an incredibly tiny isksink value they still can be considered onenot supportedgreygal
the op must be losing his mindno offense but clones are cheap in comparison to implants and the ship overallnot supporting offthewall idea

both of my thumbs for hersch
being a former tower refueler i support the general ideahowever i would rather see the mail be generated with the ammount of fuel left in the tower and the ammount of uptime left be each ammount of fuel instead of telling me how much lozone is left id also like to know how much time that ammount of lozone will last rather than having to number crunch alttab to run it in mypos or find out when i physically arrive at the pos
i have no clue why it doesnt work that way yet
to paraphrase in simpler terms for pos fuel maintenance im interested in 1 how much fuel is remaining and how do you get this infoquantify the fuel left in either dayhours left or absolute percentage based on 30days max fuel simpler for players to read and absorb next bit is getting that information and i agree it should be available at one glance in the corp assets window although preferably it gets its own dedicated window tab im assuming security measures will be in place that limits the information to authorised personnel only2 how much fuel is needed and what sortbiggest pain in the ass for any refueler is calculating the amount needed for a full tank i want to be able to query the pos in question and ask it to tell me what it needs for a full tank this can also be expanded to let the refueler to be able to manually specify a certain the number of days of operations and let the pos spit the breakdown on what it needs3 frequency of warning mails and to whomwould prefer 48hr 24hr 12hr 6hr and final 1hr notifications  directed to personnel as above just a simple mail with info on the poss exact location displaying the amount fuel left is unecessary processing as notification title says it all i just need to know which posthere ya go
perhaps i wasnt clear  i intended this to be how it worked i want the fuelmails to stop being just a list of quantities and to look like the fuel screen on the pos management window it should have a list of fuels quantities available consumption rates and time remaining and be sorted by time remainingpreferably with stront either separated out or completely omitted to avoid confusion 1 i prefer dayshours not least because its physically impossible to fit 30 days of fuel into most towers if youre going to do a percentage do it as a percentage of m3 used and put that beside the days remaining stat and corp  assets  in space is already a dedicated window for pos structures so i wouldnt mind it being used for this purpose of course itll work much better if structures can be attached to their towers in that window to reduce clutter but thats one case where i dont think a specialized window is needed 2 that would be a very handy utility yes that said im trying to avoid feature creep here  im trying to get a fast fix to one of the most annoying bits of pos management an omnibus solution is too big to happen as fast and id rather not make the perfect the enemy of the good here a full fix of pos mechanics is needed but that doesnt seem to be happening any time soon whereas i think that this could faster deployment of this would be better than making sure it has every nifty little utility attached besides add in consumption rates to the api data and itll get solved thirdparty  ccp doesnt need to do it 3 im trying to reduce spam 24h is the notification we get now and from there you can look at your lowfuel list to see which towers still need help and 6h is the nobodys gotten to it yet get on it dummy warning that said compromise may be possible id be fine with the ceo having the option of half a dozen checkboxes for when fuelmails go out  4836241261 hours before say its not as important as the rest of the proposal but itd be kind of nifty

epic fail at equivocatingthere is a big difference between getting shot down by concord and getting shot down by a playerstop blurring the lines to cover up your piratinggreifing epeen and start engaging brain before reasoningarguingat least the argument for slowing concord down is rational yours is just flat off the wall and dripping with emo
it takes 5 destroyers to take down an untanked hulk total cost of fitting probably 5 m on average a t2 fit mining minmax hulk will drop much more than that in lootgankers should htfu ops suggestion makes sense  all you have to do is pick your targets better and you can still make a profit from suicide ganking hulks just not quite such a big one
you are right those were mostly bs arguments just to point out the idiotic nature of the proposal insurance for crime is just as illogical as insurance for any ship of warlook i can respect someone that says remove all insuranceprice of t1 ships will drop artificial mineral floor goes away insurance fraud goes away hisec miner and mission runner income will crash all good things of course then wed have to deal with miners complaining about how they only make 1m iskhr and t2 stuff takes longer to buybut people calling for removing insurance for gankers are simply trying to nerf suicide ganking if insurance is removed there needs to be other incentives for gankers provided a perhaps allowing pirates to bribe concord to raise their security status with isk b perhaps making it possible to escape concord make it a risk instead of just a costill clue you in suicide ganking is part of the solution not part of the problem1 suicide ganking is easy because ships are cheap2 ships are cheap because eves economy is flooded in minerals3 minerals are produced by miners and mission runnersproblem too many miners and mission runners producing too many resources with no risk violence against the resource producers will decrease supply and increase mineral prices further miners who take precautions tank stay at the keyboard watching for hostiles will survive much more frequently than their afk macroing competitors  and will benefit from higher mineral priceshow do you promote violence against hisec resource producers wardecs simply dont work as all miners and haulers will drop corp that leaves suicide ganking  and only suicide ganking as a tool for combating rampant hisec overproductionalso4 demand is low no great wars going on5 pvp ganking and selfdestruction fraud are all sources of demand however fake selfdestructing fraud demand is not desirable6 remove ganking from the equation you further encourage more insurance fraud which is already painfully commontldrsuicide ganking is commmon because minerals are cheapmaking life harder on mrs and miners drives up mineral prices by reducing supplyencouraging suicide ganking  drives up mineral prices by increasing demanddrive up mineral prices and ganking becomes more expensive and less common insurance fraud goes away too a big nullsec war would help too but we cant force alliances to duke it out especially with the screwed up lag situation
guess againsuicide ganking is easy because you get back the amount of isk spent for your ship minus mods if you go all tech 2 via insurance payoutslose insurance now its not cheaper anymoreno one said you couldnt suicide gank just means it has to take a larger dent to your precious wallet
support as usual with this topicconcord paying me for a ship that they blew up is about as illogical as it can get
concord doesnt pay for insurance maybe you should actually try insurance and readingif you make it so that it is never reasonable to suicide gank you might as well take out the ability altogether if you take out insurance from concorded ships you take out a lot of the possible targets including anything larger than a bc and most transport ships fleets of destroyerscruisers can still take out untanked t1 hauler targets but where does it state that suicide ganking must be a group activity or that you shouldnt be able to suicide large targetsthis is a hulkageddon whine wah wah your ship got blown up this is intended you are not supposed to be safe in empire or anywhere in space yes even high security space suicide ganking has been the most nerfed mechanic in the game it is fine to kill expensive dumbly fit targets who are afk or not paying attention this is intended perhpas you need to htfu
is space ever safe no
couple posts ago you were talking like you were smart or something engage your brain you said or something like that take your own advice please try to see the bigger picture quit focusing on the individual gankeri stated that suicide ganking helps solve the current problem with eves economy too much mineral supply not enough demand causing low mineral values and insurance fraud  inflationremoving insurance for suicide gankers would only reduce ganking when in reality we need more of it yes obviously you could still do it at a loss but in reality far less people would opt to in absence of a major nulsec war driving up demand  less ganking makes the mineral oversupply problem even worse which leads to more insurance fraud and the isk inflation that goes with it dont you notice all the people selfdestructing ships outside manufacturing centers doesnt this suggest a fundamental problem to you that a ship made from t1 minerals is worth more dead than alivenow suicide ganking doesnt have to be the only solution anything that allows people to attack and slow down rampant resource production miners and mission runners would work unfortunately wardecs are broken and suicide ganking is the only way to achieve that end in hisec currentlyand like i said  if mineral prices were higher it solves all problems ships are more expensive carebears make more isk insurance fraud goes away and ganking also would become more expensive cause and effect
whats next telling me that concord should be removed because they assist in the rising of inflationall i see here are piratesgankers throwing a fit over the increasing potential of insurance getting shut offkeep crying ill keep collecting your tears
and why is this necessarysuicide ganking affects afkers macroers multiboxers more than human alert singleclient playersare you saying the macroers and afkers need a boost are alert miners who know how to align watch local and tank their ships in need of nerfing is mining veld in hisec not quite boring and predictable enough for youin short given that suicide ganking is a perfectly legitimate technique explicitly recognised as such by ccp what evidence do you have that suicide ganking needs to be nerfed
waitim crying becauseim pointing out your inability to comprehend economics or englishas it stands right now im quite happy with the current situation meaning i have no reason to cry whyi dont seriously think ccp is going to change insurance for the same reasons ive just expressed increased suicide ganking is merely a natural outgrowth of too many minerals they cant all be selfdestructed though im guessing thats what you would prefer because that is exactly what nerfing suicide ganking would lead toi suppose the real question iswhy do you want more insurance fraud are you profiting from it somehow dont you think its a bit stupid that thousands upon thousands of battleships are self destructed every day outside stations yet you want to see more of itmy goal is to increase mineral prices yeah i could fly around in low sec and pop cheaply fit insured cruisers and bcs but really that doesnt accomplish much especially considering those targets flying t1 become wealthier after i pop themthe best way to increase mineral prices aside from self destructing battleships all day is to attack the hulks and mission runners that are creating all those minerals

good point jim im getting sick of bringing my caldari ships to gangs and having to armour tank them just because every other ship in the gang is running remote armour reps but that is an issue for another timeby the way you can freely ignore stil hes a troll and a moron note that he jumped on your point that caldari have the lowest armour completely ignoring the fact that you said thats fine and were not calling for a caldari armour buff just ignore him hes an imbalance denialistactually id say that youre sounding pretty stupid yourself shield tankers have less low slots than armour tankers so any modules put there have to be balanced against damage mods a dcu on an armour tank is a tanking mod in a tanking slot no problem there on a shield tanker its an irregularity a caracal for example has only 2 low slots its ridiculous to try and fit a damage control there and of course never mind how hard it is to fit fitting mods like rcus usually a requirements if you want to fit hams or torpedoes and before you complain that armour tankers have to choose between tank and damage shield tankers have to choose between tank and tacklepointewar so you cant really plead that casei have logic your argument is invalid
not that this is in anyway relevant to an argument about caldari damage bonuses but your argument is infact not logical for the reason that a shield tanker fitting armour tank mods need shooting in the head ing over dccaracals to try and force a point with logic doesnt do much for a valid argumenti could just as well whine about not being able to effectively use invul fields on a typhoon or slasher tbqh its got about the same amount of relevancearguments about remote rep and arguments about lolfit caracals are utterly irrelevant and therefor illogical and therefor your argument is invalidsee i can use capslock too
arcane azmadi pls ignore vheri kaior too  he is the same as stil h 
maybe they should just get rid of remote armor and remote shield reps and just make 1 module that repairs both if you have 100 armor it starts to repair shields ok sure its not realistic but it would get caldari viable in rr and not the outcast or maybe a remote repair module that is scripted
yes god forbid we try and stay on topic here and what do you mean the same as in i can stay on topic or you calling meus a troll if so the report button is right there manand to jim a generic remote rep module wouldnt work from an rp standpoint and would probably be overpowered if it repped at rates comparable to what the individual reppers manage now in addition to this you have the fact that shields and armour actually work quite differently in terms of their utility in a pvp setting and it would take a lot of recoding to appropriatly modify the various carriers and logi ships a changed bonus to the nidhoggur at least and all logi ships would have to be changed and rebalanced so it isnt really viableanywaywhat was the topic again
yeah because shield vs armor tanking is relevant to this topicive a new idea lower base armor kinetic resist by 20 this would fix both the kinetic only issue and armor tanking being superior
ok so you want to nerf armour tanking to give a boost to a ship bonus for which there is no problem the idea of which is in turn a misdirected attempt to buff caldari ships which for pg cpu and slot layout and rocket reasons need buffing awesome ideaat any rate last i checked a shield tank can tolerate far more damage than any armour tank for shorter legnths of time at capital level is superior for small support ships such as intys cruisers and some hacs and is able to tank massive amounts of dps often indefinitely with any pve fitso how is shield tanking inferior either ative or otherwise its positives balance well against its negatives and on the whole balance well against armour tanking just because standard sr rrbs rely on armour as the basis of fleet sustainability doesnt mean shield tanking is inferior in any wayas an aside the fact that you consider shieldarmour tank differences important should indicate that the original idea of this thread is too poorly thought out to provide an efficient relatively self contained fix to a problem i will reiterate that doesnt exist
not supported kinetic is caldaris racial damage type
great then we can change the rof bonuses for every other race to racial damage bonuses to match their race right
yes pls
racial damage has not been implemented for over 5 years for the other races to any great extentamarr  em race   gets bonus to thermal damage output from rof and dpl bonuses also has a small range of drone boats that get rainbow damage drone bonusesthere are no em racial bonuses applied to amarr hulls apart from 1 ship iircgallente  thermal race   get bonus to kinetic damage output from rof and dpl bonuses also has a range of heavily rainbow damage bonused drone boatsthere are only 2 gallente ships that get racial bonusesmini  explosive race   get rainbow damage bonuses to there main weapons funnily allways doing a little kinetic instead of always doing a little explosiveonly 1 mini ship gets a racial bonusin the op the 1 mini  1 amarr and 2 gallente boats are included in the list of ships to fixso you see its only really caldari that have racial damage bonuses  14 ships post dominion iirc racial damage bonuses are inherintly weeker than dpl or rofall were asking for here is equality in bonuses with other races

in all honesty the best solution would be to make missiles do roughly 60 kinetic damage and 40 damage of another type depending on the missile used then give caldari ships a straight up damage bonus and other applicable ships caldari will still do mostly kinetic but there will be some tactical advantage to swapping missiles
dav reiterating the same point over and over does not change the inherent error in the point the fact of the matter is that this supposed inbalance amongst some of the caldari ships is not the result of the bonuses they have but a result of other unrelated factors the drake and cerb both have a kin bonus and they are both excellent ships that can dish out a fair amount of hurt against any ship class though obviously its better that they fight ships with large sigsthe problems that you suppose changing the kin bonus will fix will not be effected simply because they are nothing to do with the kin bonus the other ships with this supposed fail bonus all have unrelated problems that having a rainbow damage bonus would not fixon the other hand can someone give a little detail on jims idea of split damage missiles it seems to me that no matter the payload a high speed package delivery system would do some kinetic damage by its very nature so this doesnt sound bad from an rp standpoint at least i withhold judgement on the balance of it till its explained in more detail
i would be all for making gallente shoot only thermal and getting bonused to it and amarr shooting only em and getting bonused to it and minmatar shooting only explosive and getting bonused to it but then what benefit would we get caldari would get bonused to only their racial weapon but amarr and gallente cant switch damage types cant use the fact that gallente and amarr can do more damage in some but definitely not all cases as damage is related to range blasters short range so more damage balanced caldari would decisively overpower ther other races also there would be no diversityyes i know now im arguing against more than 1 person and at least you dont go screaming troll and moron to all of my posts i like debating with you more your arguments also make more senseblasters do more damage but have far inferior range they need another perk because theyre still at a disadvantage not being able to pick damage types like caldari even if we only get bonused to thermal youre trying to argue that blasters get damage instead of being able to pick the damage type when i feel that that relationship is actually blasters get damage because the range utterly sucks and sorry about kinda making the argument about weapons i just think that since were talking about the bonus for the weapons its necessary to compare weapon systems before assuming caldari is getting shafted by their bonus
overview tech 3 ships are greatthey might not have the specialized bonuses like their t2 recon counterparts but they make up for it with better tank and in some cases better dps however their main advantage and their uniqueness as ccp intended when designing this new ship was its ability to be modulart3s main feature is that you can change what your ship does and in effect how your ship looks by swapping its subsystems you can change the bonuses it gets the number of turretslaunchers the number of highmedlow slots even give it special bonuses like the ability to warp cloaked or the ability to defy interdiction bubblesin theory a player can have only 1 one t3 hull and with multiple subsystems in his possession swap and fit whatever is needed based on a given situation at hand in practice that is only true in normal space this issue i am posting about is only known to wormhole space wspace colonists in wspace players will have to either choose to stay with only 1 version of their t3 ship or choose to get an additional t3 ship for a different role or find an exit to normal space somehow haul their subsystem with their t3 ship in a station refit and come back againissue inside wspace you are not allowed to  assemble your t3 ship  change any subsystem of an already assembled t3 shipproposal option 1  allow players to change subsystems of their t3 ships inside wspace once they have been assembled in a normal space station  existing structures like the ship maintenance array can be used to change a ships fitting so why not its subsystems as well  i believe its a sensible compromise and a solution that would be well received by the whole community of wspace colonists option 2  enable the assembly and fittingswapping of t3 subsystems in a pos module  either at an existing structure like the subsystem assembly array already used to create t3 hulls and subsystems or  or by introducing a new pos module for t3 ship assembly and swapping of subsystemspros  will make people in wspace use their tech 3 ships as designed  will make lots of people living in wspace happier cons  none that i am aware ofi will be updating this thread with feedback from any comments ccp has time and again stated that they dont intent to support fullscale colonization of wspace the non existence of moon minerals ice products etc are some of the ways of ensuring that players will have to try hard to setup a base in wspace i am all up for it  not making wpsace too easy to colonize however this proposal is about fixing what seems to me unfair the players that live in wspace and make t3 ships a reality for players in new eden are the ones not able to use the t3 ship in its intended designqp
i totally agree with youjust let us swap subsystems like modules at a pos
dittothis is a nobrainer they should fix the fitting management tool while they are at it as well so you can use the quick fit feature at a possma
i would very much support option 2 as it is the better of the two options pos should be more like npc stations in how they function imo the second option allows for the greatest flexability of acheiving ship assembly refit and making a pos into more of a legitimate stationpos are expensive and require a great deal of upkeep especially in wspace give them more legitimacy i sayup
i believe that what quivering palm suggest is reasonable as did he i myself couldnt find any cons on what he suggested i am totaly supporting this one
totally have felt the pain of that as a permanent wspace denizen1000 supported
well as t3 are intended to be flexible let them be so
completely supported
this feels like a dumb technical issue standing in the way of intended design id like to see it fixed
good idea
nice idea hope it gets done p

i dont know if anyone has pointed this out already im not reading 3 pages of this stuff to find out but because your shield status is reset everytime your gang jumps from one system to another you will almost never have time to passively recharge the missing shield before you either fly into combat or have to jump again unless youre running a gate camphonestly the people opposed to this proposal arent concerned with balance this isnt a major threat to game balance between shield and armour tankers its just a matter of consistancy and ironing out an issue that annoys quite a few people the people who are arguing so fervently against it are just people who dont like shields and dont want to see them get any stronger than they arego on and deny it i dare you
the exact same behavior is observed when you change ships from your poss ship maintenance arraywhen ship that has passive shield tank will be boarded it will start from around 80 shields or as low as 25 shields assuming modules like large shield extenders are usedthis gives passive shield tanked ships considerably less buffer tank than what should be expected compared to armor tanked ships in effect any passive shield tanked ship has a distinctive disadvantage if you choose to use it in defending your pos from attacks or if you want to board one and go into a fight right awayi fully support this

definitely supported i do not care to be the developers lab rat let them test this atrociously bad idea on themselves or on volunteers replace atrociously bad in the previous sentence with any of the following illconceived insane poorly designed andor malicious what a bloody mess these troop build up missions are not only are they experimental but they were hastily conceived and tacked onto dominion at the last moment after fighting the gate campers then we have to somehow refit for pve and fight npcs that are two level highers than what the mission is supposed to beand why gallente look at how few cosmos missions we have compared to all the other empire factions and the answer becomes instantly obvious gallente is like the unwanted stepchild shoved into an attic my friend the programmer says that gallente was also selected because there are fewer of us to have to deal with when the complaints rolled in
i will suport or not support this topick only when i try one of them myself however anything above 3 jumps into lowsec is excessive and the current amount of jumps is sillyif the mission is in lowsec it should either be build in such a way that you can do it with a smaller ship without risking a very expensive battleship or that it pays much more money orand lp i am talking about several times i would prefer them to be optional personally and i would like them to be doable in a good bccurrent situation does not sound like it is right however i am all for optional lowsec missions that offer more pay
definitely supportedthese missions are a ridiculous idea that should never have got past the test server phase in the state they areif they insist on keeping these then at least offer 2 storyline missions to people  one of these with improved rewards and a standard one materials for war hauling 40k encounter near the agents systemthen people could choose either a risky better reward fw type one or do the standard lower paying one
sway the sad thing is that these were not even tested on the test server in the dev blog words they were so excited by these missions that they could not wait to inflict them on gallente pilotsthe fact they they were excited and could not see the consequences of using storyline missions to force fw pvp on pveers who were grinding faction shows how truly moronic the atlanta based eve storyline board are just shows they must be hiring some complete georgia bubbas for their atlanta team
supportedi know its a game but having an ice planet next to a sun is just ed
please before planetary interaction interacting with a temperate world with 20x the gravity of earth and temperatures of 54k would mean that all we could do is provide the populace with warm coats and exoskeletons at least require that for a planet to be considered temperate it falls in the habitable zone of a star
its simple really i want the tower under attack messages to reach my pos gunners since they will be the ones to defend the tower they will need to know its under attack even if theres no ceo or director online after all you dont want to give everyone in your corporation starbase config manager roles just to use the guns to shoot stuff right
youre making one fundamental mistake here  youre proposing pos mechanics that actually make sense this will never happen
dear god please
please see this thread
edit i fail at reading disregard this post
it should work
well you included my proposal in yours doesnt make mine not needed anymore i prefer they first fix this minor issue then look at your raised proposal which makes sense as well but is a lot harder to implement no need to mix our proposals imho
there will be no fix ever ccp have made this very clear the best we can hope for is that all the systems return to their original owners ccp permanently disables the militias and that they provide some sort of reimbursement for the wasted time
qftas with the old cosmos facwar was released realized to be buggy beyond sanity and ccp just threw up their hands and gave up its unlikely theyll ever bother to examine it again just like they did with cosmos other than fix the insane farming issuesand well theyve done their farming fix somewhat so thats thatcosmos is now a nonissue and languishes as a decent concept with completely abandoned followthroughalas such is ccp all we can do is expect it to get far far worse with d514
not that i do fw but i can sure as hell udnerstand the resoning behind wanting the game we play now to work properly or some semblance thereof prior to release of dust
a lot of the customers enjoy fw listen to them
i would really like to play eve online at very wide resolutions with fov to matchagain i implore ccp staff to try playing eve for an extended time at a resolution of 38401024 or wider at pre dominion and post dominion fov so they can actually understand what is being asked of themedit corrected grammatical error
supported better system is needed
supported insurance should be generally and totally removed but at least no insurance payout anymore for ships being destroyed by concordif insurance would be removed we would need a new isk sink replacing its effects though
uh insurance is a huge isk fountain not a sinkthis thread is not advocating the total removal of insurance since that would have huge and horrible effects  not least the obsoletion of subbs t1 shipswhen t1 ships cost more to build than you can insure them for then suicide ganking will become balanced again
as an example what you can do with a 75kb limit check these pretty awesome signatures
while i like my sig i also agree that theres really nothing keeping them from bumping the file size of the signatures these days
supported and see sig 100  characters is really limiting 255 is understandable and appropriate the current one is not id also like to push for a signature divider
the size limit is arbitrary ridiculously low and haphazardly enforcedplease increase the limit to something that does not belong in 1995edit lol hadnt seen someone linked mine my own got joinked today for filesize 
i support increasing the file size limit but not the pixel sizeit cant be put on the agenda for the next csm meeting because of the 7 day rule but we might be able to discuss it the week after
well my problem with sigs is not file size but character limitationi support a new sig size policy which allows for something like 500 characters per signature and a total of 75k if this does not work and people start complaining about slow forums when watching with pics and sigs enabled it can be corrected again any timelets just try itand yes no change to the pixels please
yes to more flexible sig limitations
signed wasnt it 50k a couple months ago when did they change it to 24k i take pride in my photoshop work tbh and 24k  pixelated limited layerless junk without transparencyexample of transparency in png8 and png24heres an example of my former sig in the two formats i tried to squeeze the most out of png8 but the format just doesnt allow for much in regards to transparency some people may ask why transparency well becuase the background of the eve forums alternates so any hard square edged sig always looks out of place to my eye and many others i assume follow this thinking as well
despite ccps amazing efforts with unholy rage people are still getting their accounts hacked chribba made a proposal more than a year ago thread  wiki and the proposal saw overwhelming support by the csm at that time was that the first csm ever unfortunately the wiki and thread provide no evidence that any action was taken at all nor evidence that the issue was discussed with ccp i realize that we are encouraged not to reraise old items but this is too important for the csm to ignoremy proposal is simple the csm needs to discuss the possibility of the following services being provided by ccp to their customers1 a hardware based authenticator which would ideally be very similar to the successful blizzard authenticator this would make it nigh impossible for any account using this authentication method to be hacked2 ability to restrict account access to ip addressesgeographic locations or isps via whoisthis would force hackers to find a proxy with an ip address which satisfies the accounts requirements you might be able to make this work in tandem with whois to restrict log ins to a specific internet service provider a hacker would thus likely be unable to access an account using his own ip address or a random proxy he would have to find an appropriate proxy which depending on how this is implemented might not exist which would fool this authentication method3 ability to see account access information  both successful and failed access attempts show relevant data such as time of attempted access and ip address where the access request came from this would allow account users to know if someone has been accessing their account this would allow ccps customers to know if a hacker has been peeking at their account to see if it is ripe for harvesting while this would be of little use for incidents where a hacker empties the wallet as soon as he access the account it is still useful to be made available to the customers4 increased transparency and explanation when temp banning an account for investigation currently when someone gets banned they are provided with relatively little information about why they got banned they then file petitions which further impedes customer support and come to the forums trying to contact ccp which provides more work for moderators players have many questions that they want answered when they suddenly find their account banned ccp should provide customers with the following information why is my account being investigatedwhy does my account need to be banned when being investigatedhas it been confirmed that my account has been compromisedhow is it possible that my account has been compromisedccp should also provide some articles which provide important information with regards to account security the eve wiki would make a wonderful repository for said articles how players can protect themselves describing the various methods that hackers gain access to accounts please also make users aware that they can be infected by malicious advertisements which exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers to install keyloggers without the user knowingunholy rage was a wonderful way to suppress rmt but ccp needs to press the advantage by making it harder for rmters to hack accounts ccp could eliminate rmt reduce gmisd workload think of the cost savings reduce petition queues give customers piece of mind and improve customer satisfaction in generalaccount security cant just be the sole responsibility of the user many users are not tech saavy and need assistance to help protect their account ccp should provide this
ccp should not be responsible for the stupidity of its subscribershow not to get hacked1 dont use an easy password2 dont downloadinstall software if you are not sure of what it is or where it came fromblizzard is able to come up with an authenticator because it pulls in 80 gajillion usd a monthi for one want my 45month going towards ccp salaries and game development not on toys for morons that dont know how the internet works
the toy in question is profitable and it provides a service some consider useful i see no reason to oppose it just because its a cover for people with bad security practices  i know a lot of people who are willing to spend a lot more than 20 on a dongle key to allow themselves to get away with being lazy i have no objection to lowering the amount of stupid busywork in the worldmemorizingchanging complex passwords in this case
i like the idea of an authenticator i am an ex wow player and did buy the authenticator i would be willing to buy an authenticator for eve dont make it required but as an optional device i also use an authenticator for work to sign into our vpn so i can work from the road i see the major positive bonuses for thisthe down side is if it breaks how would you suggest a support system to help those who have broken or lost their authenticator my thoughts on this is some system that can contact the account owner via phoneemail and provide a code to assist disabling the authenticator
deffo support since i would love parts of my original idea as well as new found techniques for improved security
oh god not this again1 if you want to throw your money away on a useless authenticator then fine but it will not make it impossible for your account to be stolen if you download harmful software in reality you are just scared of third hand reports of people getting hacked and want a magic device instead of using common sense and basic security precautionary measures again if you are paranoid to buy an authenticator then you are paranoid enough to not download strange programs or use password1 as your password 2 i dont think you know how ip addresses work insanely bad idea3 i dont think you know what hacking is hackers dont peek at your account i dont see what you can possibly do with the information ccp on the other hand can do something with the information not you you are a user not an administrator there is a world of difference between the two4 ya agree banned accounts especially for being stolen or otherwise should be given a very high priority right below stuck and billing in the petition queue especially with all the wrongful banning of players going on it is crazyin conclusion basic account security is in the realm of the user you must protect your userpass and your computer from basic attacks no amount of work from ccp can stop some genius from sending his userpass to a nigerian prince who has billions of isk tied up nor can we save people who visit isk selling sites and go gee whiz the site said to install this thing i guess ill click ok dur dur etc etc etc we must not compromise the ease of which we log onto eve to protect people who are beyond helpmy main problem with these security posts is that the few good ideas are clouded by terrible oneshowever i will support this proposal because if ccp is going to tell us account security is a problem then they should at least do something about it i dont see a problem with the tin foil hat tax i mean the authenticator or basic articles about how to create a strong password and telling users how to spot real obvious account scmas out there
yeah like eft or evemon im sure there are quite a lot of hacked installers out there if you dont download them from the original location and some websites are darn good at disguising they arent actually the real thingoh id love to see the option to lock logging in down to a fixed set of ips with a separate password for the webpage that lets me manage those i think the op has his ipaddresses about right if you think he is and i am in error please explain instead of just trolltrue most hackers would just sell all the moment they get in but you find last logged in at 1243 am from xxxyyyzzzaaadsltelstracoza at a lot of places where you can log in most forums horde webmail etctrue however providing means of security which go beyond something you know into something you have doesnt have to exclude the less secure userpass though you should be able to disable it for your own account as soon as you have an authenticator hence not making your login on your ultra secure pc slower or more difficultyou are debating an authenticator will make logging in safer provided it will be possible to make said authenticator mandatory for your account
i am actually quite tech saavy and am quite confident in my accounts security i use an uptodate antivirus i use a nonstandard web browser so i can avoid most of the exploits out there i have my computer behind a natenabled router so a hacker cant even see my computer unless i am the one initiating contact with them i am careful about what i download and execute i do not run my account as an administrator so any trojans that i accidentally executed would not be run with admin privileges i would not need an authenticator myselfthe idea is that some people are not tech saavy and dont really know how to secure their computers an authenticator allows those who are paranoid but not tech saavy enough to secure their home computer properly to be protected from account hijackingssure i do ip addresses are owned and operated by iana which delegates certain rangers of ip addresses to various registries these registries then sell these ip addresses to various users  most of them isps large corporations or telecommunication companies these companies can then distribute these ip addresses as they see fit isps for example distribute ip addresses that they have purchased out to their customers so they can access the internetif you have an ip address you can determine a certain amount of information about the user for example my ip address starts with 24 the ip addresses from 24000 to 24255255255 have been delegated to arin so you know that i live in north america if you do a reverse dns lookup on my ip address you will find out that my isp is charter communications and that the dhcp server i use is located in bay city mi you now have my general geographic locationmy idea is to get ccp to utilize this information and restrict account access to an ip address which is owned and operated by my isp this would make it so a hacker in europe would have to find a proxy server on my isps network to even attempt to access my accounti agree that this is of marginal use to the user however this might be useful if you have a family member or friend who figure out your password probably because you wrote it down somewhere or chose a bad onei see not all of my ideas here are hairbrained while i agree that users should be solely responsible for their accounts security i also believe that it would be in ccps best interest to do something on their end to improve account security after all they are the ones who want rmt and macros done away with the most
song li i have to agree with many of the posters here in that we cant be getting rid of isk sinks in the name of a playerdriven economy if you dont also reduce or remove a faucet by an equal amount or maybe a bit moreif they were npcseeded bpcs and the bpc was a significant portion of their current price then i think that might be a good idea but then you wouldnt be doing nearly as much for the indies since they would be relatively  the manufacturers might like it and im sure some nullsec alliances especially drone space and wormhole people would love to haul bpcs and minerals out instead of towers but everyone else has to deal with the inflation tooontopic we need to get rid of or reduce a faucet to have any significant portion of a pos cost in playerharvested resources this simply cant be implemented by itself
i dont live in 00 but this sounds like it needs fixed pretty badlyedit support

there are two parts on this proposal one based on an asumption one notfirst of all in massive fleet fights many  if not most  of pilots turn off effects  missile and turrets effects in order to reduce lag thi is where the asumption comes in and it is that the server still send updates on those things to the client thus this being only a measure that helps only the local client and not to reduce server side lag 1so proposal number 1 goesif client has eefects turrets  missiles disabled the server to stop sending updates on those to the client 2proposal number two not based on any asumptionwhen serverloadnetwork load exceeds a certain treshold the server to automatically stop sending updates on effects  ie sensor booster  and missile and turret effects i have a ferm belif that all players are more intrested to have working modules and a decent controll on the ship rather than being able to see if that ship they are fighting has or not a sensor booster fitted  this atleast in massive fights  small scale pvp is diffrent  also seeing alot of lazors is ofc nice but if that means i cannot deactivate my laser for 10 minutes i happily give that updevs could crunch some numbers and try to figure the positive impact on those changes  csm to propose that and comunity to agree or disagreeplease discussvotetldr version if it would reduce lag would you agree the effects sensor booster repair effects etc and guns  missile effects to be cut off from server in massive laggy as hell fights 
the server is very likely not responsible for effects updates only positional updatesthe client is the one that puts the effort into special effects that you outlinedyour making alot of assumptions as to howwhats involved here might want to do some research first
the client have to know when to display those effects it recives those from the server otherwise it wouldnt know when to display those effectsserver sends that x is pewpewing into the pos  client displays that x is pew pewing in posbut if client isnt displaying  and in big fights this makes more lag better just not to send this information anywayits a lagfree vs nice graphix vote and i vote for less lag
drake i beg to differ  how does your client know who is firing at who or who is using what modules the server needs to tell it as a lagreduction measure in fleet fights removing that information from being sent at all seems like a good way to squeeze a bit more performance out in a big battle i dont know if its practical or worthwhile but it should be investigated
either way neither of us know whats involved we just assume it to be the casebut yes it needs to be looked into
i would guess the information in question is batched to try to differentiate between who has what effects on then create multiple batches of information to send to the groups based on who has what running would likely put even more load on the server if the problem was coming from internet bandwidth this would be a logical solution however as the lag is isolated to a node it would seem the bottleneck is server side therefore adding more processes would likely make things worse not better depending on what is the bottleneck
batching the information packing it and encrypting it into the protocol used between server and client shurley takes much more processing power than just discarding it in regarding to communication with clientswhile bandwidth shouldnt be a bottleneck at first thought anything that reduces it is welcomeand if filtering based on client preference will ahve negative inpact well better just not send info at all in reall laggy situations shouldnt be hard to implement but thats where the taste of the players come in want module lag with posibility to see where the other people shoot 15 minutes ago or to be able to activate your guns nowwell nowsoo tm
im makeing assumptions as well but they req you fill out a req for large fleet fights to reinforce nodes by y is thete not a automated system in place to proactivly predict this i mean take the most recent lagfest in y2 i think thete was 2 large cap fleets could the system not say well we have a few hundred here and a few hundred there chances are they are in jump rang and goung to engage lets reinforce both in prepetatons if nothing else when the cyno lit up its was a forseeablevbattle again im making emperical observations
i can be mistaken but put this way it seem the server would not tell you the player computer who is firing to you who is firing to your corpmates who is not firing at all who is remote repping a shipcan become real messy in fw battles where you can have neutral third party presents and in any battle where you need to know who is doing whatthen there is the not small problem of desinc with less information sent your pc will update the situation to what the server see with less frequency increasing the chance of a desinc about the animation very often it has almost nothing to do with what is really happening serverside as the eve program on your pc from what some dev said do a lot of prediction based on previsions informations and check the real serverside situation at large speaking in computer operation time not people perception intervals
for the parties involved  eg weather you are targetting someone or you are beeing shot at  it will allways display as it should be diffrent code involved you are reciving damage or you are doing damage or current target takes damage it will show upas far as remote repping yes indeed it will be a problem as it will be a third party to third party effect and would be removed question is if that information is vital in 500 to 500 fights that would benefit most from this change and in witch lag is a far more important killfactor than who reps who after all logi in range should allways be killed 
i dont think this is feasible as a csm proposal first of all we dont know the code second we dont know what efforts ccp has made and is making under the surface to improve the game
i want to add that this bookmarking idea opens a new pvp frontier quite simplyif someone is so bold as to provoke and steal from me during a mission im sure they have the guts do duke it out with me in a more fair environment than the mission pocket space when the mob is aggroing methus i would be able to warp out refit for pvp and get back into deadspace while they are still looting in a matter of a couple of minutes to start a fair fightall in all the possibility of bookmarking mission deadspace would benefit pvp potential tooits a winwin solution for several problems
this was a really great troll thread mate really cute it looks like you netted a bunch of saps hell you even got mebutwere all onto your clever gag now its time to just let this one go  let it die back into page 2 or 3 and not be heard from again its just not funny anymore

out of curiosity i just checked the csmwiki on this topic there are three entries so farsubmitted 15062008 by serenity steel kill rights should be transferable csmthis one goes a bit farther then just allowing for a bounty hunter profession but is right on the path was supported by all csmmembers with one abstainmentsubmitted 17082008 by dierdra vaal bountyhunting improvements csmvery much what did propose probably should have looked for existing csmentries first they added the idea to just create bounty contracts on pilots without killrights no results of csm oder csmccp discussions provided in that entry but it looks like this is linked to the next onewinter 0809 no date at this info 2nd csmccp meeting minutesit was discussed generally agreed on and supported by both csm and ccp but as i read it no decision made and the issue diedso former csms liked it ccp stated they would like to have it and its just a question of priorities maybe we can shift priorities a little or a bit more then a little
i was playing eve online with mercenary totenkopf my main caracter for missioning after getting a email letting me know i can play for 5 days for free kind of like incentive to start playing eve online after a year of inactivity well this may sound like a whining to some people but i am sure this is something that eve is aware of and its churn of people leaving the game the griefing in this game is off the charts to be more specific its rewarding to those that device a way to use the pvp rules to theyr favor in a high security area 09 motsu while i was doing mission agains guristas forgot how it work out with all the hardeners to fit and what damage to do i had a nice golem before i left the game and got bored and stop playing wich left me with barely 50 mill after i came back spend about 20 mill to refit my golem with all tech 2 stuff to my surprice i got 5 guys warping to my mission i reply in local you found me lol well they all left and leave me alone after one guy just warp in i didnt pay attention but he got very close and got taged as hostile i attack with the drones knowing he was stealing my valuables from the mission i was spending my time earning the money in a honest way surprise surprise he warp out and come back with a ship setup with em and specific to pvp when he knew what mission i was doing and he knows my setup is pve heven tho i offer him my 30 mill wich is all i got he blows me off letting me know that there is more money maybe if he just blow me off now i got 60 mill and no ship to do my lvl 4 missions enjoying my 3 months work to get the golem was banish becouse someone was feeling like using the meachanics for someone is not playing pvp is the weaker target he find and exploit that fact to his benefit instead of going to 00 and do all the pvp he can dobottom line game should be fix when is not allow to do pvp in high sec unless both parties concent i didnt concent to be stealing my loot and i didnt conect him to be in the same mission i was there is no education system for coming back players how is the new ways they mechanise to grief other people beutifull game but bad bad pvp gameplay or should i say bad gameplay experience
someone unplugged your mic
sorry when i hit enter in the tittle it actually created a post without anything in it but i updated with the original though
hehe no worries was just kiddin with yain regards to your post though ive fallen headfirst into the same kind of trap before i lost a raven not too long ago to a really clever trap however while i was ed about losing the ship i was more ed at myself for falling into it the guy who did it pulled off a good trick and i lost the ship and learned a lessoni know its been said before but eves toughespecially when youve got creative minds at the controls of your opposition nowhere in the eve galaxy is safe play learn get even if you can
i know what you mean but the game dosnt allow you to get even like that i think to get even it would be any ore thieft or can flippers or whatever litte discusting tricks they use to leave them falg for a month so they undock and you see them undocking and you have the opportunity to blow them off you can hunt them down  i am not saying they are the scum or anything like that i am just saying they have the opportunity to grief and i dont agree the game i paid tricked me into thinking i am in a safe enviroment when in fac rewarded to grief if i had fun doing things like that i think this would had been the game i play it just needs people to think they are playing something you will actually have fun and it does a great job in desiving people into playing and then to get this kind of suprice specially if you playing hard and honest anways it dosnt matter i think after all this is a free gameor i think it should be if you going to have griefers i wouldnt care if its free but when you pay and have this kind of results to loose your real money and time in this no i will problably be mad for the next 3 days and forget i subscribe and let it to be cancel again at least the 5 days was free i guess but i have nothing to come back for
okay three things 1 the enter key 2 the shift key 3 you played eve long enough to be flying a golem and you didnt know that if you shoot at someone they get the right to shoot back you deserved to lose it if you were in your nice new vexor or drake i might feel pity but a golem pilot ought to know better for that matter youre flying a mission boat with utility highs and a tractor bonus  why was there anything left for them to steal you have brought disgrace to carebears everywhere
1 thing its only the most obvious troll ive ever seen op you dont even get 110 weak as they come
i am just stating a fact in eve that make this possible to be able to trick somebody that you are in a confort zone 09 and its allow to this guy to steal from me get taged fly away and he this with all the intention to ransom me and blow up my ship my records should show i have never fought in pvp no experience how it works the guy got tagged with me he flew for 3 minutes without attacking i assumed that he was able to continue for those 3 minutes to steal from me becouse i didnt attack in effect he left once i attack no intention to blow him off i didnt care for a kill mail for a destroyer if i knew what to do in that case when he left i would had finish salvage and left the area where he could had come back and not able to destroy my ship ironic enough his corp is called yarr or something like that i guess a pirate wannaby so is safe to asume they like to grief either way my proposal is to make a guide for pvp in the game not something you have to spend 2 hours to understand the mechanic and say eh it can be done if they get taged should be a pop up saying for the next 15 minutes no matter where he is he can attack you if hyou attack him that simple i lost my ship they lost my subscription threrethats behind but they could add that litte message in the future and i wouldnt call that griefing laack of education in this game is my complain
this
ok i dont understand what shift and enter does and yes i did got a golem after 3 months of grinding missions not pirating for ransom or doing pvp the pvp of the eve element is just perfect for 05 i assume becouse thats is what the game tells you that you leaving secure area but in 09 there is no warning well anyways i hope the points goes trhu and they put this warning hey you getting stealed dont defend yourself becouse they just want to tag you back and blow you for ransomsonperiod
you mean to tell me that youve played through the game long enough to get a golem and you have no concept or understanding of combat mechanicsand you also claim to now understand the shift key and the enter key on your own keyboardok this is a troll yep definitely a troll
i am the victim and you guys call me a troll oh well my main language is not english making fun of me dosnt get anywhere shift and enter you guys problably means that i dont capitalise after periods and dont hit enter if thats it  then it dosnt have anything to do with the issue an yes i have not played pvp all my life in eve the game you can train without playing it when i got the golem was the pinacle of my money if i strive to build money i would problably invested in the tengu wich i can fly but dont have the money or a carrier but dont have the money the game lets you advance without actually playing the game i didnt know it was a sin not to log in everyday and not play pvpi dont spect my ship back hopefully my money i spend in the subscription would be nice but that will not happent but if they add some features to the game so things like this dosnt happent is all i ask any other comments not related directly to stop griefers i will ignore becouse dosnt make any sense
they are referring to the fact that your post is one giant wall of text with no paragraph structure the enter key and no capitalization the shift key it is not unreadable that way but you are asking people to do extra work to read a post that is essentially you whining that you havent learned anything about the game in three months if you alienate people before you even present your argument you arent going to get a positive response
you left out the bit about flying a golem
ah i understand is no biggy is just a game that can be improve or not
most people who play eve wouldnt consider it an improvement you undocked you agreed to the possibility of losing your stuff i couldnt unravel whether you actually had a proposal or what it was if you did from that wall of text but id imagine that any proposal you have would utterly destroy what most eve players think is something that makes the game what it is if you want a game where griefing is looked down upon theres plenty on the market eve is a game where youre expected to be able to take care of yourself  either learn to do so betterand we will help with that if you want it  the game may be cruel but the players arent generally or decide that you cant and walk away
actually you are right now that i think about it is the freedom to do anything you like in this game even the danger to encounter pirates but then i again i was in a safe sector 09 where the police is around i think if someone steals the police will come and get you but then again it wouldnt be fun for everybody just a small warning should be great when pvp is about to engage is all i was thinking about but i think after a shower and looking back to the game i feel like i was just grinding for money to buy better modules now i think have the opportunity to sit back and rethink what i would like to do next if i decide to play eve thx guys for the ones were diplomatic enought to make the posting constructive
if all you want is better notifications i dont think anyone will argue very strongly against you making sure that people have some way of knowing what theyre getting into is important you seemed to be asking for game mechanic changes which is why we all jumped down your throat
i am sorry i think i feel i need a translator sometimes i try my best to express myself yes the idea is better notification to understand what i get intospecially if i am about to loose a pve ship my golem to a educated pvp playeri think i will subscribe to eve i am installing again the game problably this time around i will be a miner hoepfully there is not a big a surprice again
please use the enter key its there for a reason and as a miner depending on where you are you will also encounter can flippers are you sure you want to attack them using the few medium drones in your paper thin retrievercarebeareve has 1 rule in large friendly letters dont engage in pvp in your pve or mining ship you should know that by now  the golum was driving the message home hard but youll probably dont forget it now 
obvious troll is increasingly obvious
commonwealth let me tell you that youre being called a troll but in all honesty i havent read a reply thats coherent or simply intelligent to your original postwhich by the way only an imbecile would not understand correctly even if its not correctly puntuated or in perfect englishin instead understand your point perfectly since i too believe that if you like pve and every player has a right to enjoy it above all else you shouldnt be shafted for it just becausei already posted around about this since we pve players called carebears are the joke of some mongoloids that frequent the forums

although i highly dispise this behaviour i think wardecs should be possible and the presumely friendly militia member shoots friendly should stay in game but just like in the original proposal increase the standing drop and i suggest hitting them there where it hurts most fine them for isk lots of itthe more they do it the higher the fine they might recover their standing but every next time the fine should double start with a million double it for each time again after 10 times the fine reaches a good billion isk that should keep em from abusing the loose standing gain stainding game and if they really want to shoot fellow militia members they have to go to the wardec system
this
if you repeated ly kill members of your militia you should be kicked out you can attack militia members as much as you whant but not from under friendly flag
the issuegas mining requires too much micromanagement due to the fast harvester cycle times and is a logistical pita for wormhole minersthe briefto create a gas mining vessel that is cheap and versatile enough for mining capsuleers to risk flying in wspace but not so overpowered that it is impossible for a roaming gang to catch ie no warp strength bonus or cloaky warps that looks good and is not a t2 bantam and that doesnt crash the gas market by being too uberreading other schemes posted involve giving t1 mining frigs a new variant who really wants to fly a t2 bantam or giving the skiff a new bonus its a mercoxit specialist and creating the oftasked gas strip harvestersi cant find my original idea in the features forum but it was complicated and also involved gas strip harveys so here is the nessus v2the proposalore having seen the growing market in t3 ship production saw the need to create a dedicated vessel to meet the growing requirements of gas miners risking their lives in unknown territoriesusing the latest technologies in light metal alloys and inspired by the prototype zephyr scanning boat ore have created a light fast ship capable of absorbing radio waves used by current capsuleer scanning methods as a result the nessus will not show up on combat probe scans to create such a vessel meant removing most of the armour however as a positive sideeffect this hulksize ship has a mass similiar to the lighter gallente cruisersthe hulltype is covetorhulk black skin but with armour and hull hp like a skiffthe upside for minersless need for a hauler no need for jetcan mining less mass use on the wormhole less micromanagement of moving a few units of gas around every two minutes the downside for minersstill no afking if you are found youre pretty much kb marmalade on cold toastthe upside for piratesbeing unable to probe out the nessus directly may seem like a heavy penalty however you can still just probe down the actual gas sites and heaven forbid i suggest as a miner myself cloak up and wait for us hell you could even train to fly it yourself think of the opportunities a nonscannable ship could have and now youve got exhumers you can help out at your corps next mining op you know you want to  and of course reduced mass use on whs also benefits everyone using the wormholei was thinking maybe the nessus wouldnt show up on dscan too but i figure a thats maybe too much of an edge more for the wardecpiracy angle tbh and b probably complex to implement since dscan is closely tied to the overview although of course that needs a major overhaul itselfmain skill requirementsgas harvesting v exhumers i with all the usual prereqsbonusesmining barge  5 to all shield resistsexhumers  5 reduction to gas harvester and mining laser cycle time per levelspecial abilitiescannot be probed with combat probes400 bonus to gas harvest yieldpenalty 100 increase in gas harvest cycle timefittinghi slots  4 with 3 turrets can only fit gas harvesters or turretbased mining lasers and 1 utility highmid slots  2low slots  3rig slots  2native statsshield hp  1819em  375exp  65kin  50therm  625armour hp  450em  70exp  10kin  15therm  45structure hp  505max velocity  257msmax cargo  2500m3dedicated gas hold  5500m3 so 8000m3 total gas capacitydrone bay  25m3bandwidth 50agility  comparable to a blockade runnermoving the hulks 3rd mid to a high gives a utility slot for a core launcher or standard cloak and the 4th mid to a low also further reduces shield tanking ability but allows greater flexibilitystrategic fitting for stabsagility expandersmlus if fitting mining lasers 400 yield bonus means you effectively get 6 harvesters on only 3 turrets thus removing the need for a new ship model however much we miners would like one

i dont see the need of this as gas mining is currently balanced asis i do not like your immunity to combat probes no ship should get this least of all a mining vessel speaking as a miner also you make the skill book pointless as last i checked it could use 5 gas miners you planning on returning the wasted sp on lvl 5 and no mining vessel should get a utility slot so that idea has to go as well so much wrong with your idea i have to say you need to chuck it out the window
now thats a carebears dream righti would welcome the dedicated gas harvester bonus on a t2 mining barge but that feature is a nogo for me but then again i dont believe a dedicated gas harvester ship makes a lot of senset2 gas harvesters are pretty easy to train for and their yield is sufficient i dont believe that if ccp had the option to create a new ship any ship with such a weak role would make the cutid rather see a mining ship with the ability to have some decent tank  firepower to defend itself or something else than thatmy 2 iskqp
gas mining is pretty much standard jetcan mining im not too terribly offended by that i have no particular objection to a gas exhumer but your proposal is a bad one  you say that a stab bonus is too strong but want to give it immunity to probing thats crazy talk
thanks for your replies here are my responsesim basically trying to think outside the box a little i dont really see nonprobable ship which we already have with covops  which wont even show on the dscan of course this idea would as a carebear dream as finding an alternative to miners trying to tank against pvpers unless youre always able to have a couple of hac backups through a wormhole 200mil of hulk is not likely going to survive long so tank is pretty meaningless on a mining boat in pvp territory  thats why the skiff has the warp strength bonus its not always about tankif a roaming gang sees this ship on their dscan they know im out there but theyll have to find the site im at and maybe warp bubble the wh exits once they find the sites they can warp to the middle of the gas site leaving them the choice of shooting the miner at range or flying the 2030km to scram or get their covopsfalcon in close for a direct warp in meanwhile the miner has a nonfighting chance of survival by being alert and agile using their dscan as usual having a few seconds to get to warp if the pirates only get the 45km warpin position and havent bubbled the exitisaac with the stats i listed gas harvey v on the barge with t2 harveys is giving you 6 effective turrets so i dont see that as wasted sp besides which you need gas v to get t2 harvies anyway so gas miners are likely to have that regardless besides you can continue to fly with 5 turrets on a turret bc continue jetcan mining with all the risks and hauling that involves i think thats a reasonable choice a pilotcorp can makethe might be an issue with scouts then using this ship to close down 00 systems by warping to a safe somewhere but then thats no different again to someone cloaking in a covops they too cant do anything else other than report intel and the idea of a mining ship stopping 00 belt ratting carebears from leaving their station quite appealsin terms of a mining ship having firepower i think that has to remain the realm of a few light or med drones or fleet supportjyn
ops solution is foolish and overkillscreams carebears wetdreamnot even exhumers have it that goodskiff has a 2 warp stab bonus but at the cost of capacity and efficiency 1 high slot and itty bitty cargo baydrone baytanksolution  gas strip miner to be employed on mining bargeexhumereasy less work for ccprestrict it to the procurerskiff not widely used class if you wana get picky but new ship is not needed
too overpowered unprobable really
yup youre right someone should suggest a nerf to cloaks sometime
better than immunity to probing
heh maybe but being immune to a direct hit with a combat probe is not the same as immunity from being found like a covopsim genuinely interested to know if you are anti the idea because it would be overpowered in which case why is it overpowered or simply because it might take a couple of minutes more to locate someone mining by locating the gas field rather than finding the ship directly and having the miner warp scrammed within seconds of getting a hit on a combat probesome posters in nerf cloaks threads have a real beef about covops frigs and blockade runners and yet despite warp with cloak those ships still end up on killboards sometimes due to pilot error sometimes due to smart enemy tactics and occasionally to a bit of enemy luck since mining vessels cant fight and i think shouldnt be able to is it unreasonable to suggest a way to give a miner a slightly higher chance to survive a tank approach doesnt work just look at the number of drakes lost in wspace but drakes can at least try and fight back and are insurableso perhaps take out the utility high and the ship can only fit the lasersharvesters therefore cant cloak up or probe out a wh if the pilot is forced to use logoff tactics or make an offgrid safe somewhere i simply feel this could be a way of creating new tactics for both hunters and their prey all while making the task of building t3 ships a fraction easierjyn
for people who spent forever training up hictors they really dont have a great of a role in combat as their smaller cousins dictors do  at least in 00 i was thinking increasing the bubble range to 30km would make more sense and make them more useful in 00 fights  large combat fleetsas it is now dictors are the go to tackle but die very often this change seems like a good balance between the 2
ummwhat you can tackle and hold supercaps how is that not a role you have a giant tank you have the ability to force engagements i think this is a good enough role
dictors who die frequently are either stupid in the sense of going forth without backup or poorly fittednot supportedps dictor pilots should expect to get primaried with that in mind your not likely to solo various things unless you know you can tank it
i think its good to have the heavy dictor to be boosted with more shield or armour depends on ship type this will increase their effective hitpoints on a passive tank they have the habbit of melting fast when u use them for their intended role tackle supercaps light dictor and heavy dictor have good roles i dont think u can compare those two however i think 30km is too much 26km with l5 skills is better just enough to make a differance for the few months of training extra and the extra risk more will become a bit too much i guess
might i be the one point out that these premiums arent worth it a cerberus costs about 2030 times as much as a caracal but if you put a cerberus against 2030 caracals itd be vapourized before you could even finish saying isnt this analogy rather tortured t2 ships are brutally effective in 1v1 matchups against their t1 counterparts but are not costeffective in the slightestfrankly i dont see why they even bother having insurance in the game for t2 ships at all i think it needs fixing so that platinum insurance covers at least half the cost of the ship this would soften the blow without making it possible to replace the ship almost for free
wrongbase price is fixed according the following numberstritanium 1pyerite 4mexallon 16isogen 64nocxium 256zydrine 1024megacyte 4096
the fact that people fly these ships disproves your point people are flying in them and dying in them in pvp on a regular basis you appear to have some unwarranted sense of entitlement which dogs all bears today why should the blow be softened if you dont want to fly a t2 ship then by all means shell out on 2030 t1 hulls this is the option you have if everyone was able to afford to lose t2 ships on a regular basis where would we be then where would the new benchmark be
personally im waiting for the t3 battleships and the sudden surge of whiny posts about how it takes too long to train battleship 5
ok different angle if they made t2 insurable for anything resembling market value it would cause massive inflation
has my support for a number of reasons
maybe but what info would it show and that seems like something that works much better in a trailer with uncluttered camera angles than in actual eve where its more likely to get in the way this seems like too much work for too little benefit to me
any info would be better than the current situation currently you just see that you have something targeted in that direction all the actually useful and necessary information is displayed in other parts of the screen even a different color targeting reticle or a small icon for corp fleet blues reds wartargets would be of some help although this is more of an issue with the infolack of with the target iconsbasicly some of the info you currently have to fish out from the overview and look at which target it corresponds to could also be implemented as visual markers on the view screenlocked target it would just make things more convenient and the more customation you allow the better the featureedit the idea is to have visual markers for the info instead of having to read the info when ever possible it is faster to take in and would help to reduce the need to fly by overview
agreedmaybe show distance to target and transversal velocity for starters

what this proposal isa reccommendation that the csm preemptively demonstrate to ccp the communitys support for hulkageddon this proposal does not seek to address insurance sec status loss concord reaction times training time for gank destroyers or any of the other possible nerfs to hulkageddon this proposal is nonspecific please do not attempt to turn this proposal into an argument about anything specificthere is nothing that i have seen that makes me believe ccp plans to nerf hulkageddon i just believe that we have to demonstrate a united support for the event in order to ensure ccp maintains a handsoff approach i would merely like to have the csm let ccp know face to face that we as a majority of the engaged eve community support the existence of player created events that make inventive use of game mechanics to provide the community with entertaining game play specifically in this instance hulkageddon lets not wait until hulkageddon goes the way of privateer allianceedit because i cant spell
laugh nice trollabout the only examination i would ever care to see resulting from this laughable lameness is an overview of its impact on the market or complete lack thereof im sure that there are more than a few souls in the market forum with enough understanding of the market to perform such an analysis only ccp can look deeper still to see how much is idiotageddon affecting things or other factors such as moon trash mining or lack of and just plain old market manipulation lvv
i have no idea what this is supposed to accomplish i dont see any nerf inbound and expressing generic support for pvp is something that can pretty easily be discerned in any everelated conversation of any length with a solid majority of the csm members
the contractescrow system has been much improved over the years from the agony of its initial inception it could however use a few more adjustmentsin item category i would like to be able to check for either blueprint original or blueprint copy as well as any blueprint of either manner it would lower db calls when sorting for suchor an indicator if the contract is for a copy or original without having to view itin item group i would find it just as convenient to search for entire categories rather than simply one particular item at a time example ammunition rather than a specific type or modulesship equipment as opposed to just hybrid weapons in this regard i am still talking about blueprints which if you select you cannot break it down by groups and are forced to go through each type individually which is a major time wasting pitamissiles needs to be split into advanced missiles and normal missiles just as all other ammunition typesand i think everyone can agree that there should be a way to remove want to buy annoyances
wtb scams can be removed with the minimum price function if i recall i dont bother myself so i cant vouch for that as for the rest of it its a bit fiddly but yes you seem to be thinking along the right lines
i would like to advance the idea of a sticky on this forum in which topics that consistently come up pos destroyers war declaration ect ect ect can be linked for easy access so that they dont keep getting reiterated with new posts because people cant find or are to lazy to look for make the thread locked for csm or mod editing onlywe have it in market discussions science and ship fittings forums already seldom updated but better than the same old threads repeating ad nauseumthanksstoner
yes that would be quite handy
i tried to make it so that stations still had some advantages more securemore hp cloning facilities far more researchmanufacturing slots including capital manufacturing unlimited docking iskbased ship repairs instead of mineralbasedif ccp notices anything else they dont want poses doing they are welcome to remove that part of the proposal this is merely a compilation of the requests people have put onto the boards and gotten a lot of support for again if you see anything that doesnt seem right you are free to contact me in the game or here and ill amend the document if i feel the issue is justified

proposal make a negative wallet a more permanent problem by instituting penalties to carrying a negative wallet balance when set by a gm for buying isk as opposed to situations where a capsuler might end up with a negative wallet through normal game mechanics it is important that this be done only when a gm has reclaimed the illegal funds and not for any other situationcurrently when a player buys isk they can use it to make purchases or give it to an altother account character if the first case when ccp discovers this they can ban the account or take back the bought isk which if the player spent bought isk it can make their wallet have a negative balance in this situation they have gotten away with using the isk to gain an itemshipetc and can benefit from it even worse if the player used a separate account to buy the isk they could get ill gotten itemsships to another account that might escape gm punishment and throw away the account that purchased the isk if using an alternate character on the same account trade items to their main and biomass the alt with the negative wallet thus escaping the negative isk situation any of these situations allows the player to get away with their violation of the eula and in certain situation face no real penalty biomass the alt make a new one i suggest that when the account is given a negative wallet by gm interaction removing ill gotten isk that a flag be set causing several penalties to be placed in effect until the wallet is no longer in debt1the character with the negative wallet cannot be biomassed or traded until the wallet is no longer in debt locking up a character slot2the character cannot use contracts or do in station trading to other characters3have the character with the negative wallet have their skill queue locked so it cannot train any more skills the queue would finish any skills in it and at the end any of the other two character slots on that account could train skills but the character with the negative wallet would not be able to4perhaps the character cannot alter their skill queue skills continue training until the queue is emptied and no new skills can be added the skill queue is locked preventing training an alternate character on the same account as well if this is chosen then option 3 is not needed i see this as a more extreme measure and it can be argued it is too extremei leave the penalties somewhat flexible and the above are my suggestions there are arguments for and against them as well for other penalties the spirit of this idea is to not make it impossible to keep playing a characters that has done this but still make the gain of ill gotten isk less likely or easy by having some more consequencesthis wont address all the problems with someone buying isk and still gaining from it even after ccp steps in but it can do something about certain situations there are ways to get around the burden of having a negative wallet but still possessing the ill gotten itemsships assuming ccp doesnt do anything about them ccp has stated they do not want to punish players
id default to ccps view on making it more of an impact as we dont get the meeting minutes on issues where characters have bought isk and why one was banned and another only had the isk removed
if your going to request harsher punishment you might as well request the account buying the isk be banned all together as youve effectively shut them down as it isbut then they would say its too harshand thus your proposal is also too harsh even slightly lesscant support something like thatmain reason  youll crush first time offenders who have no idea why or where when it comes to isk buying
i disagree here for two specific reasons 1 the player would be under pressure to solve their negative balance or suffer skill training penalties this could cause them to either leave the game or worse simply use rmt again rather then take a skill hit the only other option would be purchasing plexes which would imply they have to pay ccp to get their account working properly again 2 gms do sometimes get it wrong regarding who is involved in rmt and who is not there are always a few who get punished unfairly and have to peition escalate and escalate again to get their ability to play eve normally back sadly i doubt this will ever change under your proposals these players would most likely just cancel their accounts imagine simply playing eve and suddenly you log in to find you have been accused found guilty and punished without ever doing anything wrong this would certainly make any player lose their desire to play which ccp doesnt want your first suggestion regarding character termination and trading i think is great though this should not be allowed this is a great convo and i hope some other options are considered such as time period based banning of repeat offenders using credit card numbers etc to track them and such
afaik you cannot trade or use contracts because of the broker feesyou cant even sell anything i dont believe
what you propose might as well be a permaban a player with a negative wallet cannot contract or market goods and now you want to prevent station trade as well that leaves them no way to dig out of the hole except outright donations furthermore youre telling them that they cant train skills until theyve gotten a donation  gee i wonder what effect it would possibly have to tell people that they have to secure a donation asap in order to have a chance of keeping their character even slightly usable dont be dumb  you know perfectly well where those donations are likely to come from if the guy has already bought isk once im all for dealing harshly with people who do things like rmt but what you propose isnt harsh its just counterproductive if youre worried about disposable characters taking the rmt and then passing it along then follow the money afterwards dont tell people their characters are permanently ruined unless they rmt again and somehow manage to avoid detection thats just silly
go to your room son adults are talking
so is anything going to be brought up concerning the rather inept war declaration system were currently forced to endurethere have been many suggestions on the topic over the years far too many to even begin to link the current approach seems to be toward using a contract style system that allows for surrender terms or counteroffers from the targetslikewise war flag persistence on a pilot level to limit the rampant abuse of corpalliance hopping
we cant raise a vague proposal about wardecs and just point ccp at too many threads to link if you want to put together a consolidated proposal in the assembly forum then well look at it and put it on the agenda if you are waiting for one of us to do it for you then youll have to wait a bit longer till the initial rush of already raised proposals have been dealt with
i know i am not a csm person but can someone on the csm please take up this issue remove the gallente experimental storylines where pve missions runners are forced to fw pvp and go into camped low sec systemsi have given my views in other threads
totally agree the ability to move the camera focal point leftright on a slider would also be handy not only for dual monitor users but those who prefer a wider overview stacked windows or room for the now much improved browser
i was honestly horrified when i read what poss actually were graphically please this
well im actually familiar with insurance in eve but the reading thing is new i gave it a try and heres what i foundthe concord assembly alliance includes the corporations concord ded inner circle and secure commerce commission concord is the corporation that destroys your ship when you do something naughty the secure commerce commission is who you pay in order to insure a ship if you read your wallet journal with the reference type set to insurance you will see that this is where your payment goes you are actually correct in that concord specifically does not make the insurance paymentit comes from an entity called eve central bank which is not an npc corporation there is however a player corp by that name but the entities are not the samehowever when your ship is destroyed and you receive said insurance payment you receive an evemail from the scc that looks something like thisinsurancefrom secure commerce commissionsent date timerefid your friendly insurance company has transferred  isk into your account for the recent loss of your ship so concord blows you up and the sccin the same alliance the concord allianceorders the payment for your ship thus the concord assembly destroys your ship and orders that you be payed for it it doesnt pay you specifically but it is the reason that you get paidi submit again that this is highly illogical do you have any more snide comments or quibbles
currently suicide ganking is no risk business even less so than mining or missionrunning there you at least have the small risk of losing your expensive ship and modules and cargo while suicidegankers can work with free ships and practically free modules so even if they fail at what they do they still dont really take any dent in their walletsi dont really care how it is done but zerorisk business practices should be removed complete insurance overhaul would be the best solution but removing insurance from concorded ships would be a startsupported for the sake of insurance overhaul not neccessarily in the way suggested in the op
ganking is a no risk businesscompletely not true ganks fail all the time costing the gankers time and sec status as well as the ship which is a cost when ships costs are higherbut that said lets play your game and remove insurance from suicide gankingganking a hulk is hardly a profitable enterprise even now  with cheap t1 ships availableremoving insurance means it would cost a battleshipbc ganker like myself 3040m  fittings just to attempt a gank on a hulk destroyed t2 fit hulks drop at best 510m in modsresult of your nerf unless the hulk was faction fit  there is no way to profit from ganking one  in fact it would become a very expensive hobby at best translation extremely rare or simply not occurringmining in a hulk now becomes a completely riskfree business activity what were you just saying about that they should be removedoh you i think you forgot to say that you just meant risk free pvp activity should be removed while pve should be all profit no risk
this should not be about suicide ganking lets face it the insurance pay for a destroyer is small compared to the possible gain by suicide ganking so i do not think it would have a very large effect on itpeople will still suicide gank and make profit from itthose who support suicide ganking must still admit it does not make sense for an ally of concord to pay out for ships destroyed in criminal activitythe points made about inflation and insurance fraud are good onesthat does not change the fact that this insurance issue makes no sensei think the only way to fix the problems that generate the need for suicide ganking is to fix the problems with war decseither way i dont think making this change to insurance pay would have that big an effect though i do agree there might be a small amount of reduction in suicide gankingbut i would also point out that there are tons of things in eve that are there for balanced gameplay and that dont make sense i dont know if this particular issue is where i would make my stand on what should be realistic or not
for those complaining about logic in terms of concord paying for suicide gank insurance consider this u can hear guns and missiles when theyre being shot and explosions yet theres no air in space to carry the sound waves one little frigate is strong enough to warp jam and webify a huge battleship hell even a carrier or dreadnought u can warp through any object whether its a station planet or asteroid unharmed but on conventional drives it would be like hitting a wall and u cannot start warp like this either u cannot warp in a random direction because u have to align to a celestial object for your warp drives to lock onto it u cannot lock onto another ship to warp to it even if its not moving at all u can only warp into the deadspace entrance but u can warp out of deadspace no matter how deep u r in it microwarpdrives still function inside a warp bubble but not deadspace the sling bubble effectthe list goes on and onmy point is logic in terms of realism shouldnt be a basis for debating this because the creators can shape that aspect to their liking whether it would be for uniqueness or balance its science fiction after all
supported no insurance payout for concord kills
what gets me is that all the pirates who trumpet about risk vs reward being such a big part of eve and constantly call for carebearing aspects to be nerfed because theyre too rewarding without being risky enough want to be able to effectively suicide gank for free because uhim sure a reason will come up soonadmit it pirates you just want suicide ganking to be free so you can continue to do it for the lulz rather than for profit
suicide ganking is free because there is an oversupply of mineralsif you want to actually help miners you will look at why this is so and consider the fact that mining doesnt even supply 50 of the minerals produced in the gamewhen i started playing eve a raven cost 134 million isk so it cost something like 4050 mill to lose one after insurance consequently battleships were rarely used for suicide ganking
it is widely talked about that eve is like real life and therefore not safein real life if someone is caught by police he not only get a punishment in our case its the loss of the ship but also he is not insured anymore would need to be introduced and if he has got the money he as to pay the damage he caused ie not only the truck but also the freight ie other carsthis would mirror life more realistic thats no whining just pure factsso if someone ganks a iteron 5 with 6 catalyst in a myrm he should loose insurance for the myrm pay the iteron probably with or without rigs and the cargo at least in 051in low sec there should be only the loss of insurance as its more like wild west but still you loose insurance cause of improper use
i agree with the proposal it is not suicide ganks i have an issue with but being able to suicide gank with no risk of loss to yourself is a bit much
comparing things to real life is nonsensebutin real life criminals get away with their crimes about 50 of the time and thats murder cases in the usa its probably far more often in violent places like colombia or nigeria in terms of lesser crimes escaping punishment is far more commondoes that mean you want people to be able to escape concord and all consequences of their actions at least half the time or more id be in favor of that  it would offer risk to the situation after all  especially if you want to increase the penalty for getting concorded
i disagree with this it is the resemblance of real life that allows an immersive environment like eve to permit a players suspension of disbelief the fiction of it makes it gratifying when we can accept it as at least plausible enough to enjoy without doubting the experience when aspects of a game reach the extremities of believabilitythe criteria for which we base on our own reallife experiencesthen we begin to doubt the game and basically call bs on it this is where the concordinsurance problem comes into play if the police shoot out the tires on my car in a highspeed chase i seriously doubt that geico is going pay for the wreck that follows shortly thereafternot to stray too far offtopic but im heavily in favor of a concord revamp i think the current form of concord is more magic than anythingthey can appear anywhere and everywhere regardless of circumstances then they just loiter for a bit and then vanishconverting them into some kind of detectandpursuit force would add mountains of room for playerpirate creativity im all for it
once again its never free in addition to the risk of failing ure already guaranteed to take a security hit the instant u start shooting and it only gets a lot worse if u succeed and if u fail the victim will have the lulz at your expense so essentially u and your fleet r the ones who lost security for his lulz and regaining that much security lost isnt riskfree either the same risks and guaranteed penalties go for everyone else that takes part in the suicide gank and for what if its not a hauler carrying valuable loot thats the target but a hulk carrying extremely bulky ore wheres the profit in thatbottom line is from the instant we accept the concord warning were already paying in some way as is and in case u forgot theres nothing wrong with doing something just for funits still a game
i support this and if i wasnt lazy id start up 500 alts and support this as wellzero risk ganking of 150200mil ships is total bs and hulkageddon benefits from this quite a bitnot saying that this is just for hulkageddon zero risk ganking is a loophole to be surethere should be zero percent insurance payout if concord asploded said ship if youre not ganking someone and you get concorded you either got tricked or failed hard and you just paid for a lessonskanps to the poster above me annabottom line is from the instant we accept the concord warning were already paying in some way as is and in case u forgot theres nothing wrong with doing something just for funits still a gamereally i mean seriously 200mil does not equal a sec status hit plus possibly implants its not even equal or the the sameif you need it broken down further i can try going barney style and use one syllable words
that last part was funny considering it included something to the effect of im gonna pimp out my clone and hulk with the very best mods i can get and afk mine in a place where i can still be shot at and if anyone does kill me and my pod its just wrong and i assume ure gonna stand there with a wtf look on your face when ure ejected into your pod do u have any idea at all how much the sec loss is from podding no of course notthats probably why u factored that in too right if u need it broken down further i can trying going barney style and using one syllable words too that is your own fault its your own fault u loaded your clone and ship with overly expensive mods its your own fault u thought u were completely safe when its called high security and not complete security and its your own fault u didnt even attempt to save your pod
supported suicide ganking should cost the ganker something significant not just a risk of failure a security hit that can be made up easily farming some decent l4s and a few million or so for fittingsif that suicide should be to impose grief or otherwise strike a target that cannot be hit any other way as it is nearly every suiciding player risks practically nothing if they fail and stand to gain if they dont suicide an empty rookie ship or other worthless target which if that is their choice it should cost them much more with insurance they are free to suicide anyone and anything provided they can gather enough like minded players to join them at minimal costs if the target isnt economically viable barring making new penalties for suicide ganking removing insurance payouts for doing so meaning concord killed you is the way to go
only u dont gain security for every single rat u kill in just one systemthat includes missions its only the highest rat every 15 minutes give or take per system and try high sec ratting just for security and see how long it takes to get your status back from one ship kill
i love how all the people complaining about ganking having no risk conveniently forget about kill rightsany ganker can be aggressed  and have his ship destroyed for 30 days after a successful gankgankers have to spend some time in space ratting up their secstatus which means they are often vulnerable to attack in a pvefit shipmy own killrights page has nearly 40 people on it any one of them could use a tracking agent to find me and get revenge i mean they dont  i guess because they would rather spend their time whining on these forumsbut the ccp provides all miners with the tools they need to get their revengeso quit complaining miners  go find and kill those gankers quit trying to get ccp to do your work for you
its not realistic that eves police force is omniscient and omnipotentits not realistic that anyone in eve ever gets insurance for any of their ships considering how they are usedits not realistic that concord is omniscient when it comes to player pirates but happily ignores the gazillion of rats that run around in highsec missionshow about that for realism in this game
bump
i so agree with this posthybrids need some love its not even funny anymoreccp hear our cry
as always youve answered your own question without realizing it because we dont debate with trolls we allow them to make themselves look stupid and ignorant for as long as it amuses us and then we ignore themand besides we havent run out of arguments we made all the arguments we need a long time ago these arguments are correct and your counterarguments are completely delusional and without basis we won the debate several pages back like trolls everywhere you just refuse to accept it there is only one truth and its blatantly on our side but things like truth have little meaning to youoh and just to get in before your reply yes i am arrogant what of it doesnt make me any less rightok im done with you now
firstly failing to effectively counter our points defeating themsecondly going off topic defeating our counter argumentsthirdly failing to provide adequate reason for the assertion that changing the caldari damage bonus to be rainbow will compensate for actual problems with individual ships is defeating our counter arguments
sure as long as all missls get replaced with kinetic primary  therm secondary damage only with missl variants differing by range and dpsyour endurance on this proposal is quite impressive i must say
if i keep reiterating the point its because this topic has a habit of galloping off topic into a purelly balance  caldari v other races  argumentsome other proposed fixes  that go along the lines of x doesnt have enough grid and y weapon type is rofl dont address the issues raised in this threadnamely1 cmb bonuses are less valuable than other ships damage bonuses the worst damage bonuses in game atm therefore it makes balancing ships at all player levels impossible2 training time spent on ship hulls is often wasted  leading to a situation where lvl1 cmb pilots are just as powerful as lvl5 cmb pilotsfor cmbs to be competitive versus other ships without being overpowered at any particular player skill level then the value of there bonus needs to be the same as the value of the bonuses on other shipsseriossley i cant understand why people are afraid of cmbs having a 5 per level damage increase per player skill level like other races
well duh thats because balance and the means of obtaining it is exactly what this thread is about
from the opeffectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilot
neither amarr nor gallente can pick and choose their damage types therefore they are only limited to emthermal and kineticthermal respectively on the other hand caldari can pick and choose their damage types and if they stick with kinetic they get their damage bonus this is much more desirable than a fixed damage type weapon platform dont you think because personally i would rather have the option to trade 20 of my dps so my guns can do a more lethal damage type wouldnt you minmatar is the only other race that can choose its damage types but this benefit is mainly introduced to offset the low dps of its guns now heres the million dollar question would you dav support a change to missiles so they do 60 kinetic and 40 thermal em or explosive and change the caldari ship bonuses to apply to every missile this solution also solves the two problems youve listed
minmatar is the only other race that can choose its damage types but this benefit is mainly introduced to offset the low dps of its guns correct good you understandcaldari is the race that can choose its damage types but this benefit is mainly introduced to offset the low dps of its missiles now do you understand this also damage switching races have low dps and combat tactics require selection of ammo type to aim for holesmini get all damage types bonused at 5 per level as they skill up hullscaldari dont get all damage types bonused at 5 per level as the skill up hullsyes if you read the op i would support split damage types on missilesbut at 25 fixed kin and 75 choice similar to the ratios on mini ammo
dav what you have to understand here is that we honestly dont see where the problem is just because the numbers arent the same on paper it doesnt mean that balance doesnt already exist changing the kin bonus would result in caldari being overpowered in a variety of ways which would result either in the other 3 races being boosted so that ultimately the situation returns to status quo beforeboost which would mean nothing has effectively changed or there would be a resulting nerf to the caldari that would given ccps track record be a nerf of disproportionate strengththe numbers may not be balanced but the ships are or at least the ones without unrelatedpartially related problems are there are issues surrounding dps parity other than the bonuses on shiphulls that cause this parity as such this proposal couldnt possibly be implemented without causing massive problems in general and severe imbalance issues across the board
ok as you say you dont honestly see where the problem is i will try to break it down for you in a way that avoids the partisan issuesjohn and thomas are playing a computer game against each other not neccessarily an rpg  could be any type of computer game rpgfpsrts whatever the game includes player skill leveling and different types of unitsof those units some units get bonuses to the level of damage they can deal based on the players skill leveljohn is playing for the zog factionthomas is playing for the goon factionjohn has the balrog unit for doing heavy damagethomas has the iidot unit for doing heavy damagewe know nothing about the differing abilitys of the unitsboth units allthough different  with different attack patterns are largelly equivelent in there potency as the game begins  eg player level 0 johns balrog units gets a 10 per level scalar increase in the damage they do for every player skill level john hasthomass iidot units also get a percentage scalar increase in the damage they do for every player skill level thomas hasby scalar  i mean the size of the damage is increase without affecting any other paramaters the units may havewhat level of increase in damage does the iidot unit require in order to stay competitive with the balrog unit 
classifying the damage dealt into low when dealing nonbonused damage of a type that the opponent has high resists against medium when dealing bonused damage against high resist or dealing nonbonused against low resist high when dealing bonused damage against low resistthen we have a situation where the caldari always deal at least medium damage if not high where amarr and gallente can very well be dealing low this balances out nicely with them getting bonuses for a primary  secondary damage type
you assesment is incompleteyou make no mention of raw dpsleaving that aside for a minute even in your incomplete assesmentgal go from low  med  med  high as they skill upamarr go from low  med  med  high as they skill upmini go from always med  always high as they skill up  yes you are naughty forgeting mini  deliberatelly i suspect as it blows your argument out the water caldari go from med  band b   med  band a or band b  with occasional high as they skill upyou need more band structures to account for raw dps and you need to include mini
ah thanks for the response that exchange truly helped us understand each others positionit seems that you feel that missile boats are imbalanced and in need of a buff is that correct you want this feature to be implemented to offset the incompetency of missile launchers compared to other weapon platforms
funny i read several times that caldari ships would be overpowered with such a change oh wait raven already has already bonus to all missiles and it is not overpowered and no one uses caldari for serious fleets except for ecm ging why because of fitting problems that you have with shield transporters and missiles are useless in long range fights beside that you are always short on midslots with shield tanking because you still need mwd cap booster and atleast a point and sometimes you need a target painter too to be efficientin short what would this change do boost small gang and solo warfare of caldari combat ships but overpowered never but then i dont care
if you want to understand my position on the subject then you only need to read the opif you feel that this post is purelly about cmb imbalance then eithera i have not expressed the issue clearly enoughb you have not read the op or taken the time to think about what i have said
thank you for the replyi have read the op and it seems that indeed this thread is purely about the imbalance of ships with 5 kinetic missile damage bonus at least that is what i gathered from your op of course i may be completely wrong in which case i invite you to set me straight on this matter it is your thread after all
well clearly it must be a thenfrom the op and first reply posteffectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilotcaldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type switching combat tacticslooking at solo and small gang scenarioswhen an at least competent player flys a cmb he will take a selection of missiles along with himits an important aspect of cmb combat to select the correct missile for the target in exactly the same way a mini acd pilot will choose best ammo for targetcan we agree on this if yes then take a look at this scenarioyou  flying a cara skill level 5  and 2 buddies  also flying caras skill lvl 2  are out and about being naughty piratesyou come across a drake in a belt that you want to poon3 caras can poon a drake  although if your taken dps from the drake you may have to warp outin and let your buddies keep the points onother combat stuff aside for one moment what ammo do you fire lets assume the drake is the cookie cutter 2xinv 2xlsb ab pointed variantgiving it around 50 em resists on its shields and 70 kinyou can fire thunderbolt at it  doing 50 damage per hitor you can fire kinitic at it doing 30  125  kin only bonus  375 damage per hitso here we have a situation where your 2 buddies can do lets say 300dps per second on the drake by firing emyou as a level 5 pilot having spent 20 days or however long it is have no way to do more damage than themessentially you have to discard your damage bonus in order to compete with a 2 day only nub  all other skills being equalthis is what is meant by these phraseseffectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilotcaldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type switching combat tacticsif it were 3 vexors or 3 stabbers or 3 omen that your group was flying it is a cast iron fact that all other stats being equal a level 5 vexorstabberomen pilot will do 15 more dps to the target than a level 2 pilotmini  amarr  gallente get there 25 for level 5 trained hull bonus 100 of the timecmb piltos get 25 for level 5 trained hull bonus about 30 of the timeor to put it another way averaged out over many encounters a 5 per level kin bonus is roughly equal to 16 per level rof  dplnow im asking for 5 per level bonus for the ships mentioned in the opa 5 per level bonus needs to be rof or dplare cmbs underpowered and able to absorb the added benifit without become op  yes i believe sobased on looking at ships in game allready that actually have these bonuses i dont see them being used by the player base in an dispropotionate wayin fact the rainbow missile bonused ships  rave  sac  arnt that popular at all
whilst in your hypothetical here your argument is sound for the most part begging the question and making the assertion that unkown influencing factorsno influencing factors at all are things i disagree with though the former is the one that really irks me lol it is a less than optimal analogy to eve because influencingexterior factors are both known and can be anticipatedamelliorated by strategy again your comment is sound on paper but in the environment you want it to be actualised in it isnt viable without a nerf going hand in hand or a lot of rebalancing throughout all shiptypes to maintain balance basically i cannot accept that attempting to find a theoretical balance in complete isolation from external factors is a good way to ensure balance in gamei can see where your coming from a lot more clearly now thankyou i was getting confused in arguing against several posts at once in honesty but i feel my point still stands i equally feel we wont be coming to an agreement on this matter our viewpoints are essentially opposed on it so im probably going to leave it herethough id like to say that if you can throw this amount of effort behind a more sympathetic attempt to boost caldari on a ship to ship basis for example rather than this blanket boost i will certainly support it or at the least be less against it in principle 
the thing is you stopped debating the topic before telling us why our counter arguments are wrong that tells me you have no response to them nothing to say why they are wrong so they must be right correct if you say no then you have to say why you can just say because an much as i can ive said why i think your arguments are wrongit seems your response to somebody who beat your argument is troll youre a moron that doesnt make you right that makes you look like a 5 year old who cant handle the truth mom wont give me juice so its temper tantrum time your inability to stay civil and debate the topic like normal human beings will hopefully let people know that your accusation of me being a troll is trying to draw the attention away from the fact ive successfully disproved or provided a counter argument to each and every one of your points notice its you and one other person alt with more fail arguments not you dav who think im a trollthe fact that this thread is 12 pages alone can let everybody know that the truth is not blatantly on your side otherwise there wouldnt be so much controversy your arrogance has absolutely nothing to do with how correct incorrect you are all it does is make you look like an ignorant  who can only see things one sided somebody who cant realize they arent always right get the  out of your ass and grow up910 missing one point because your overuse of the troll and moron accusations gave you away
very interesting post this with lots of facts and opinions flying around some bad some goodive decided to support this topic based on the ops argument about dictating range versus dictating damage typeas per his example a caldari missile ship may fit kinetic missiles and receive a shipbased damage bonus ontop of missile characteristics an amarr laser ship may fit radio crystals and receive a range bonus as opposed to other types of crystals on top of applicable shipboni eg damage thats nice and fine and dandy now they come across each other the thoughtful amarr knew about his kinetic hole if applicable and has plugged it which the caldari pilot assumes as most players will plug substantial resist holesnow at this stage the amarr pilot with radio has two choicesattempt to outrange the missiles not likely or switch to a shortrange crystal eg multifrequency and get in range of the caldari pilot it doesnt matter which he goes with from a shipboni point of view as the bonus is to the gun not the crystalsimilarly the caldari pilot has a choice as wellhope that the amarr pilot hasnt plugged the hole well and that his kinetic missile bonus will make kinetic missiles reign above the others or switch to another type eg explosive or thermal and hope that the amarr pilots resistance will be lower there if he decides to switch missile he will lose his shipbonus in exchange for another damage type without actually knowing how itll comparehere the issue arises the amarr pilot can dictate his damage by choosing range as lower range ammo deals more damage while the caldari pilot can dictate his damage by choosing damage type as different missiles deal different damage at same range however the amarr pilot will receive a bonus to his damage no matter ammo while the caldari will lose it as soon as he moves from kinetic also in pvp one will always know how a multifrequency compares to a radio crystal shorter range higher damage while you cant tell for sure with damage typesthere are certainly other ships that have issues and other weapon systems and other types of gameplay and other fittings etc etc ad infinitum however those arguments are irrelevant to this topic as in its not relevant if armor tankers have cramped lowslots  thats another issue and linking it to this one is a logical fallacy  even if your ships are not functioning as you think they should does not mean ours should not be allowed to function
thanks for the detailed explanation now i fully understand your position and i believe that some changes may well be justified however we have to go through them on a ship to ship basis since some of the ships that youve listed do not require any additional buffs to their performance of the ships that youve listed i have only flown drakes caracals kestrels and caldari navy hookbills out of those four ships i firmly believe that the drake does not need a power boost but others i have no problem with however i would only advocate a damage bonus not a rof one as the latter would increase overall dps i cant comment on the other caldari ships because i have never flown themedit i flew the other affected frigates too but i dont really give a damn to them either way
ok one thing i dont know if it was brought up or not yet but i just took a specific lok at the bonuses on some caldari ships and it seems like the kinetic missile damage is often applied to every single missile size as in you can fit undersized weapons and still get bonused you can fit any kind of missile and get bonusednot sure if thats a big deal or not but if a thorax got a bonus to medium and light blasters itd be really really nice caldari can do that worrect or did i read the bonuses wrong
this shouldnt be a problem but i would prefer if we were toa apply the hull bonus to the weapon not the ammo on cmbsb look at the ships on a hull by hull basis and rebalance where necessaryin that ordert
not every missile type but it is quite a wide range caracals for example do get a bonus to light missiles so they can use assault launchers effectivelygood point thoughtedit here is a bit more detail as to what gets a bonus for what kinetic damage bonuskestrel  lighthawk  lightcrow  lightflycatcher  rocket lightcaracal  light heavy hamdrake  heavy hamcerberus  light heavy ham onyx  light heavy ham nighthawk  heavy
i live in lowsec and lowsec is fine if they want to boost it exploration should be the way by boosting exploration you would see the increased npc criminal activity if you need the role play background the harder plexes are hard enough but there is too many of the weaker ones lowsec combat plexes should equal l3l5 missions in my opinion the ones you can find with onboard scanner should be l3 the ones you need to scan down with probes should at least be equal to an easy l4 escalations could even be harder than l5 missionsi hear the mineral output from different ores are somewhat unbalanced this could be looked at so lowsec ore is a bit more worth than today but as ive understood this is not directly a lowsec problem more a balancing problem in generali dont like the suggestions in the opening post go to true lowsec or fake nullsec if you want players cant hold sovereignity and criminal faction have their own agents there no sentry guns will bother with what you are doing neither will concord so no global criminal countdown or security hiteve already has a player run underworld and black markets if you expose it to the daylight it will not be a underworld or black market anymoreconcord provides security against crime too not only faction navys do this and in war times borders are well guarded by navy makes no sense to have lowsec borders throughout empire if anything it should be harder to smuggle over war borderscrooked cops no reason to implement npcs to do what players already do better
1 i like where youre going with this but i think sentry gun immunity would be a bit much a more balance approach would be the pirate group that systems police are on the payroll of could be bribed from stations to end the pirates global criminal countdown early this would allow local pirates to do their thing without waiting a full 15 minutes between attacks act as an isk sink and still be somewhat balanced because the pirate would be criminald at least as long as it takes him to dock 2 hell yeah with piratey lp stores and rewards too3 a proper black market sounds like a great idea i dislike using npc orders to fuel smuggling though i think a better approach would be for the smuggling profession to be moving those black market or pirate lp items out of lowsec and into or through highsec the tricky part would be developing some kind of system whereby its hard to move these things into highsec customs agents but players living in highsec would still be able to use them 4 id be ok with this especially if more pirate items come through rewards as it is now the main way to get pirate items is by killing npc pirates and looting them which i am sure concord doesnt mind at all plus as i mentioned above making them blanket illegal to use kneecaps a player driven smuggling profession5 see 3 and 46 meh7 sounds good but i think its practical application wouldnt really helpand of course a personal 8 give people a reason to go out of their way to hunt pirates i was a lowsec resident for a long time under the anti piracy banner all we ever got was the occasional thank you to pay for fighting pvp experts all damn day security status gains standing gains bounty hunter profession implementation etc give the good guys a livingedit forgot to add 8 will increase the lowsec population by having antipirate corps come back in style more pirate opponents and non pirate non pirate hunter players wanting to exploit lowsec riches more chance at security more pirate targets its really a winwin
read and think before commenting and dont pile together 2 very different posts i have not asked to make low sec safer i pointed out that you will get even less people there making gate camping easier point for point1 you want a way to disable gate guns so you can use interceptors and lock even fas jumping shipsperfect so you make a granted thing that a large part of the haulers that today pass through low sec will avoid it tanking a smartbomb in a blockade runner is easy tanking a gatecamp long enough to get away when a inty has blocked your jump capability and webbed you is way harderend result of this idea less people will live in low sec2 criminal agentslow sec has plenty of 4 20 agents so what do you want pirate faction agents in competition with 00 so that you can lower 00 rewards more pirate faction lp  lower value for pirate faction lp new pirate factions with new toysno to both fw is exactly new low sec faction with new toys i dont want to see all the pve work ccp do for a year used for low sec or 00 damaged to favour low sec 3 meh and mostly useless but no problem with this4 no already explained why by other comments5 ok6 no7 no again you are again searching for a easy gank and btw you make a liar of yourself when you post this if you read the post it is not about pirating you rich folk of hisec
i like how the guy says thishere go the hisec emo boys if you read the post it is not about pirating you rich folk of hisec its about making lowsec a better playing environment for those who want to live there if you dont want risk dont go to lowsec it isnt as though hisec is smallof course it was said after his post where he wants hi sec made into little islands surrounded by lo sec does that sound a bit contradictory to anyone elseheres the real problem with lo sec it has nothing to do with players wanting to avoid risk nothing to do with game rewards mechanic or anything of that sortsimply put wannabe pirates camped certain chokepoints so frequently and killed anything that passed through with no regard to if it was worth killing that no one bothers to go through there anymoreatm you go to low sec for a few reasonsto camp a gate with friends so you remain 100 safeto sneak through in the smallest of ship you risk little so might as well try the shortcutyour so new you think low sec is the place to go for some pew pewyes a few ppl prolly go to mission or run probe sites the above stands true for the majority of visitors though
i spend a good deal of time in lowsec and my corp flies the antipirate banner though somewhat loosely we engage reds when we can find them but more often than not well get bored after a couple hours of system jumping and not finding anyone with a low enough sec status that well just go ahead and lock up the first yellow we see or anyone whos corp sounds piratey other than just getting in some pvp theres absolutely no incentive for most empire dewllers to go into lowsec on the flip side a lot of pvpers live almost entirely in high sec because its safer and easier to wardec in high sec so you can play station games all day and catch the occasional noob not paying attention so what weve got is a large number of industrialists that pretty much have to go into lowsec to do pos stuff and the pvpers that live almost exclusively in highsec does anyone else see the problem with thatgive me some incentive to shoot the reds and leave everyone else alone id move to lowsec permenantly if there were oportunity to make the kind of isk i make in highsec and im sure others would toowhats the saying that ccp is so fond of with great risk comes great reward i lived in 00 for a few weeks when i was a wee noob and i can say that a busy 00 is way safer than old man star on a slow day theres the great risk now wheres my great reward
lol so youre basically piratesanyways low sec has so much potential quite frankly itd be nice if they did anything at all with low sec 1 from me
i disagree those illegal itmes drugs etc should be sold somewhere to npcs for a good price real smuggling is lacking because there is no profit give people a smuggler trader profession with seeded buysell orders in lowsec and get a real underworld blackmarket going you could even produce a smuggler class t2 ship i would suggest the frigate class minertrader ships tormentorbantamnavitasburst and give them bonus to agility and a special smuggling hold thats small bonuslvl in size but almost immune to customs officials make customs in high sec better at their jobedit support but discussion also required
low sec to low sec npc to npc illegal items trade with good rewards is a bad idea it will reward people with jump freighters or even titans read the old threads about the enriched uranium trade by bob via titan jump portal and pump isk into the system via npc buy orders a low sec npc to high sec npc option with some kind of special buy order accessible with standing with the right corporation or something like the old agent offers before the lp store where they asked for drugs offering some good deal would be better some kind of black market lp store where you can trade illegal items available only in low sec for special implants or other lplike offersessentially using illegal materials available in low sec like some alternate version of the tags used in some lp store offer add some skill or ship modification to increase the chance of passing custom and you will have a new kind of tradeyou can already make more isk running mission in low sec than in high sec risk is higher but reward is higher toobut that dont seem to be what interest you if i read you correctly you want a way to make isk doing pvp rightsorry but that is not possible without breaking the gamepvp is a negative sum game as a group the participants in a fight finish it with less net worth than before starting it counting insurance payout as something already owned by the payer some player in every fight can end with more net worth if he loot the enemy wreck but he will always loot less than the value of the items lost by the other player changing that will remove every consequence from pvp fights making the game some kind of fps
pvp is not an isk making endeavor for the most part you can make isk with ransoms and through the resale of loot you want incentive to shoot only reds how about the massive increase in traffic youll see incentive enough low sec is less safe because the inhabitants there are morons shoot everything in sight then wonder why no one ever goes through thereas for the risk vs reward argument what you want a ticker every second your in low sec you get x amount of isk low sec missions pay more then hi sec missions low sec probe sites are better then hi sec probe sites what more do you want reallythe only reason low sec sucks is because the inhabitants are morons no amount of game mechanic changes will change the fact the ppl living there are idiots who will shoot a shuttle for the lulz
removed post as i completly ed up the quote thingy
how about making the seeded buy orders a cosmos spawn that are fairly small and can be fulfilled quickly basically drug dealers needed a quick supply that is outside of their normal supply this prevents the haulnaught make billions in one cyno thing no these cosmos agents could then respwn elsewhere in the regionconstelation for another deal high reward but probably high risk passing through low sec and hi sec with valuble illegal cargo hence my suggestion of a t2 frigate that is a smuggler
first off dear god of pyramid quoting please save ussecond npc items sold back to npcs as a game design sucks its something ccp should move away from not towards
wow cant believe you cant refit subsystems with an sma that seems like a really glaring oversight supported
of course
great idea
aside from allowing the tactical drone fleet commander or what have you i like this idea i think having one person control all of a fleets drones could be to over powered however there is assist so maybe ccp wouldnt think sooverall a very sound idea well written signed
pure awesomesauce
incredibly well thought out  anything to improve the current drone interface is supported by me i particularly like the idea of the fleet drone tactician  thats what i want to be when i grow up 
as a domi ishkur ishtar curse and pilgrim pilot i support this
not supportedyes and i want a queue feature on my guns also so ill select the first 5 targets they will shoot  also autotarget and autoshoot ewar usersmaybe also an iwin button that will autotarget and autoshoot whoever is in optimal range and why not to be able to asign my guns to the gun commander  a new role btw  so he can shoot instead of meirony offdrones are not perfect but nothing is but in any case what you are asking for is too much any pilot is actually in touch with their systems  you are asking basically for a fire and forget  be afk  weapon  erm its not gonna happenbtw your request puts more strain on server dronewise  and drones are already worse enemies lagwise so even for this reason alone its unsupported
woot love it
im impressed with the amount of thought you put into it but am wary what ccp will say about it
fw low sec is not that scarry ffsand arnt these story arcs optional ie no one makes you do them
they are not optional if you are grinding faction standings you know so that you can then sign up and do fw and only gallente have the pleasure of being offered them they are very badly designed for all sorts of reasonsa force you to go many jumps into low sec yep pve ship through pvp pirate spaceb are fw warfare linked so take you to systems with fw pilots waiting for you toc take people to the same few systems because of the fw storyline link so those gates are player pirate camped as they wait for the missions runners to appear to give easy targetsd are way above the agent level you are running for eg the level 2 storylines are harder than level 4 missionse give a crappy reward of an implant that is worth about 100k iskthese experimental missions were introduced as a surprise in dominion with it appears little thought or understanding of the mission runner player base by the moron eve storyline board in atlanta with no testing on singularity in the dev blog words they were really excited about these missions which shows what idiots some of the ccp developers and pve content writers have become and how little they understand or care about the pve player basebtw these storylines are going to all players so you find that you have run 16 mining or courier missions to be rewarded with one of these uber pvp combat missions as a storyline to get faction standingso think about that  you are a pve industrialistminer noncombat pilot and you get given one of these storylines and may be given another after another 16 missions so noncombat pilots grinding faction are being given these uber forced fw and pvp many jumps into lo sec missionssupremely dumbi can see pveers just grinding missions for corp standing only with one or two corps with the best lp rewards so soon all the pve playerbase will be running for caldari navy if these missions are introduced to all faction space
k sorry my bad i was thinking they were some sort of new arcbeing kos in gallente space i have not had the chance to try them out for myself yetcan i ask one questiondo the missions require the complete destruction of all npcs in the plex like most standard level 4sor are they more like fw missions where you only need to kill 1 structure  boss ship  or a few industrials if the asnwer is the second  eg they are like fw missions  then they can probably be completed with a stealth bomber in the same way most fw missions are done
not optionali was unaware there was a ccp employee standing behind you forcing you to click acceptand of course only the gallente are being offered them would you rather see them test it with the caldari instead yeahthat would soooo work to test a system to encourage people to join in fwinstead of just ranting like a maniac and saying how you hate them offer solutions to fix what you feel is wrong with them and still achieve the intended goal if you cant do that then you shouldnt be bringing up a halfased subject up that the csm cant actually do anything with when they present it to ccp other then yeah x people hate it cause of this we dunno how they want to see it fixed
thanks for the hint on completing them they do seem to be like fw missions go into fw lo sec space and destroy baseship which is surrounded by tough npcs as well as being fresh meat for fw pilots and pvpersthe problem is that they are storyline missions and have level 1 and 2 versions which means that noobs grinding faction with no idea of the game and having not yet made friends or joined a corp may get these missions as a storyline offer  in these storylines which are fw linked only a few locations are being used so these are now being camped by fw pilots and pirates to whack the first noob that pops through the gate for the noob they are very hard and give a false idea as to the purpose of storylines  hey how to keep people interested in the gamewhich seems dumb as these pilots will not have the right skills to fly the right ship or the appropriate game knowledge also if you are experienced but are grinding faction on an alt to join fw it makes it very very hard to grind up to the required faction standing for fw also minercouriertradingindustrialist pilots are also getting these fw pvp combat missions so will not have the skill for them however many sps they got usually if you run noncombat missions you get noncombat storylines to be given one of these pseudo fw nightmares dreamed up by whit ccp eve employees on pharmaceuticals is beyond belief yep hard to believe but these new storyline missions really are that badly designed rushed and untested if they had gone to caldari agents i think they would have lasted until about the next downtime but us gallente are stuck with them as hapless guinea pigsno one is doing them they are being turned down i mean even if you are in a corp if you are grinding faction and doing some mission running are you really going to ask your pve corp mates hey guys want to come and lose your ships waste time and be pvp easy meat by helping me do one of these really really stupid and poor new fw forced pvp storyline missionsor would you just run another 16 missions in the same time and hope you get offered one of the old proper tried and tested storylinesin my view the eve storyline board in atlanta should be reprimanded and or sacked whatever ways there might be to get more pveers into fw and low sec and pvp this is not one of them
aloriana some people are getting these 4 storylines in a row that is after running 64 missions the only storylines they have been offered are these complete abominations of a game mechanicsome of these players are not combat players but miners traders and industrialists who have run courier and mining missionsit makes grinding faction very difficult and frustratingmy solution is simple remove these badly designed experimental missions which were never tested on singularity first but which were rushed in at the backend of dominion with little thought or even comprehension of the pve missions runner playerbase the csm should deal with the fact thata such a poorly designed game mechanic was introduced with no testing or even player consultation you know at least with the csm via focus groupb by people who despite their title eve storyline board seem to have no idea about the role of storylines faction standing and the mind set of pve players who run missions and grind factionc if this is the best that ccp employees who represent the pve side of the game can come up with to move pveers into low sec pvp and fw then questions should be raised about ccps recruitment management and quality assurance policies if ccp have teams that are this poor at designing content then the csm should be asking questionsi have actually stopped grinding faction on this alt an alt whose sole aim was to do fw once they had the standings the opposite of what these whit designers wanted to achieve
see this is exactly what your opening post should have been instead of your current opening rant but there are some points you must secede to because they do make sense if you look at it from a whole beyond what you hate about it you cant just remove them entirely because they do serve a purpose so you need to learn to compromiseand to be honest if they had tested them on the test server it wouldnt have gotten a fraction of the testing its getting now and the galente do offer the most appropriate way of testing it theyre very low on players are losing and this helps to funnel players in it gives them the option and even just a small incentive to at least try itbut lets deal with your issuesfirst what would you suggest they do to prevent the multiple offers in a row problem should they program it to activate at a certain standing level should they give you two storyline options 1 normal 1 fw which type of agents should you be using for it to activate dont just say combat since most do include combatsecond if you think the system is entirely wrong what would you suggest they do to achieve the same results theyre trying nowthird attacking ccp employees divisions etc will not garner any points when the subject is brought forward do you believe that ccp will listen to the csm members if they present the idea and say nobody likes it cause your people suck and did it wronglastly why did you stop entirely the storyline missions have slightly more rep as a reward but thats all youre still getting rep for regular missions is the potential loss of rejecting a storyline mission every x missions really that great a potential loss
okfirst ideas only to people who are running combat missions and give them a choice one of these or an ordinary storyline mission give people a choice to be a lab rat or not like we have the choice to be on singularity or not this would allow people to continue to get faction standing as storylines are still the only way of getting faction standing on this alt i need 001 to join fw and i hit this new storyline wall of crapyour second point on ideas needed yes i should have some but i think that on various forums players better than me have given very good ideas on improving fw low sec and pvp sorry but i fail here and leave this to those with more knowledge than me i do know that what they have done is bad and is not workingyour third point my main has been in since 2003 and at times it seems that ccp and their employees seem to make huge mistakes and show very little insight at thinking consequences through the t2 bpos seeding scandal the bootini fiasco coverups of gm favouritism and then inept apologies when the coverups are unearthed the pos duping of t2 materials bug being in for several years without action then the coverup and another apology over this it just goes onthese mistakes keep happening and make ccp frankly look like amateurs the lack of testing of game concepts here is shocking the atlanta storyline team clearly got caught into some group think and thought their idea was wonderful and vomited it into dominion as a pavement pizza of an idea this shows poor quality assurance poor management and a poor understanding of the pve playerbase by people responsible for pve player content to not even concept test this with player csm reps is astounding to then force it on players so ineptly smacks of rank incompetence they say they were so excited they just had to get it in there for at least one faction they admit it was rushed and untested and yet would have given it to all factions if able we pay monthly for this game we have a commercial relationship with ccp and at times they just seem to take us for granted with a haughty there it is like it or lump it attitude in the past this would work because of the nerdiness of game players who were delighted with the challenge games in the fantasy genre such as vanguard warhammer and conan have shown that paying players no longer accept bad game mechanics and bad product and will walk awaywith no scifi competition worth a crap ccp is in a captured market position and too often they seem to exploit this dominance to their own end too often i feel like ccp just  all over me and expect me to be gratefuli like the game run two accounts keep coming back but ccp seem to keep putting barriers up and not routes to try new things
wrong on all accounts1 the dont make sense as mission for people outside of fw if you do cargo deliveries you aspect to get them to peaceful countries unless you are a contractor for the army 2 this is the stated goal essentially linking missions to news items but doing that the wrong way affecting only one faction and without any idea of some kind of falloff from themthe idea that they are there to encourage people in joining fw is a player deduction but nothing support thatthe purpose seem to be that it is cool to have a mission linked to a news item so when we will get a mission to bring ships to a alliance during a war it would be wonderful to have a mission that require you to bring ships to the stations of the it alliance or to their enemies it will mesh wonderfully with eve evolving story while i agree that testing them on the sis server would have been almost useless no pirates no attacks by other players without consent low population testing them on the gallente is the wrong idea exactly for the reasons you list they are low on fw players and this kind of mission will not encourage players to join fw being slaughtered by the enemy militia and pirates while you learn the ropes is the wrong way to incentive people to jointhey are losing and adding even more losses to people getting gallente standing will not encourage people to run for gallentefor the above reasons this kind of missions dont help funneling players to fw it teach you very early that caldari npc ships use ecm and that you have no way to counter that eccm dont work on npc that missiles hit very well in pve while guns work fairly badly so what they teach is that going against caldari npc in low sec is the worst way to go in low sec and that it is best to avoid joining the gallente militia as the npc you will meet are the worst to meet while risking pvp try doing pvp while the npc use ecm on you 
only fw agents should offer them to fw players unless i am a military contractor i dont want to get delivery contracts for military bases in the middle of afghanistanas the sated goal is to link long standing new items with missions ccp can chose less constricting new only a few target system only a race affected or macke them epic story arcs agreed yes it is a faction gain that you get every 16 missions refusing it hurts btw a comment i just got from corpchat from a caldari character with very bad gallente standing trying to correct it and my plan to work for quafe in annaro is a bust  out of 4 storyline missions i got three of them were low sec 21 jumps away half of which through gallente high sec to kill caldari ive wasted a better part of a week trying that instead of making my usual income
the reason for not allowing a pc version is simple no cannabalization of their market share mmo players are relatively stable in numbers ask most people they at some point or another have played an mmo true new players are rare therefor to get players you are required to get them from somewhere else read another game by releasing dust on the pc ccp would be forfeiting some amount of eve membership to those who are more interested in an fps style game by only putting it on a different platform consoles they minimalize their risk of thathence overall it is more profitable to ccp to seperate the markets for dust and eve and more profit means more developement and better games or at least more eye candy therefor i do not support this
thats very true dek kato but the other side of the coin is that eve has created a loyal fan base before the game is relesed so it would be purchsed by a large number of people that can not get it on consoleby and large if your reading this you have made a choice of pc over console ccp has made a choice of securing there new income stream over serviceing there customers if they decide they dont want take my money for eve and dust then my money will do the talking as it walks over and gets mass effect 2 or some other game
good discussion i post some my ideas as well in original thread
and there is room for a lot more as well good mechanics would only help entice more into it
i support this as it stands now plexing only benefits the individual through standing the npcs need to be toned down a bit in terms of ewar so they dont dismotivate  ie play a smaller role in the outcome of player vs player combat inside a plex at the very least there needs to be some sort of reward beyond standing for plexing lp isk you name it also system ocupancy should mean something beyond occupying a system for giggles and bragging rights the concept of plexes was a very nice idea it would promote combat between simillar types of ships something that caught the eye of a poornewish player such as myself
agreed although thissounds way too easy to exploit
 remove 3 of the launcher fittings add 2 turret fittings add 8 power grid change interdictors skill bonus from 5 to rocket and light missile thermal damage to 5 to small hybrid turrest
the same goes for the heretic why they went from badass guntoting destroyer to mehmissilerocket spewer is beyond mekind of makes sense for caldari but amarrgallente bubblers were shafted rather well
having the t1 caldari destroyer be a missile platform would be nice too
having a second destroyer for each race with the caldari one being a missile one would be even nicer however since that isnt going to happen ill settle for making the eris not suck

this ship needs love bad
ah  yes i hardly ever got insurance payouts i mainly remember to pay for it the odd time actually insured a ship but i stay correctedhowever and i did not read this thread so this was probably mentioned already at some place here it would be interesting to have some data about insurance premiums paid and insurance payouts handed out maybe it is not that big a fountain but i dont know nevertheless insurance need to be reworked or even better removed
minor point but insurance does have the capability of acting as a sinkin theory if someone buys a ship purchases insurance and then doesnt lose the shipisk is removed from the system as the  of insurance policies expired approaches 100 insurance is an isk sinkbut yeah in reality it generally acts as a faucet as lots of ships tend to explodeand right now its a firehose of isk people are actually purchasing insurance for the express reason of selfdestructing for profit meaning the  of policies expired is approaching 0 and the number of policies taken out is skyrocketing too bootits a big problem and sadly it seems beyond most eve forum denizens comprehension
the insurance system has been showing its age for awhile now it is overly simplistic and is not robust enough in an everchanging market simply put we need something that doesnt seem to have an infinite supply of money and resourcesedit forgot to support

yes
in the early days there used to be missions that turned slaves into scientists caretakers etc there could be a round robin loop of missions that convert one type of person into another with different results depending on the faction it might be good to make these the fw equivalent of the faction standing missionssomething along these linesminmatar slaves  freed slaves  freedom fighters amarrcaldari marines  powgallente slaves  freed slaves  marines caldariamarr marines  pow amarr freedom fightersmarinestourists  pow  slavescaldari gallenteminmatar marines  pow  forced labourthe gaps would need to be filled in to account for all the various types of people under passengersfinally you could have missions to recover your sides pow from enemy fw complexesdeliver pow to your faction navy for a reward like with tagsif this is added i think it should be done in a way that enriches fw edited i also like this mechanic variation of the same idea

whats so bad about trash it i dont think that literally means shoving in a trash collector trashing  relinquishing possession of  freed slavesif ccp is going to spend any time on this issue at all it should just be to change the words trash it to release which has a more neutral meaning across item types while still retaining implication i assume when i trash an ibis that someone picks it up or something im not actually shoving an ibis into a compactor

can you elucidate by providing a sample scenario in which a pc infected with malware can provide the attacker with the appropriate information with which to steal that accountmaking an authenticator mandatory as blizzard is proposing for world of warcraft means that the people who arent paranoid enough to use strong passwords and common sense will also be protectedthe user is the weakest link in the security chain an authenticator removes that link leaving a strong chainunless the user also registers the nigerian princes authenticator on their account theres nothing the nigerian prince can do with the informationan authenticator does not add that much effort just type in the number the authenticator is separate to your pc so it is immune to malware attacks against the pc it is immune to spyware you inadvertently load on your pc with your sony music products or microsoft technology demonstrators for example
another thing to note is that the npc seeded items have another effect on the economy they force 00 alliances to be dependent upon logistical lines tofrom empire currently 00 alliances need to go back to empire in order to get pos fuel and pos modstowers if you were to remove this npc seeding and made bpos for these items available then it would be possible for a 00 alliance to be 100 selfsufficient in 00 space never needing any resources from empire which could be a bad or a good thingnot supporting though because of the isk sink
this is a really simplistic way to put it but you cannot arbitrarily remove isk sinks as there is no government controlling the amount of isk in circulation and in eve there cant ever be theres no way to collect on defaulted loans so theres no way to introduce more money into the system except for isk faucets unless we want to see a completely runaway economy your proposal as is at least wont work you have to come up with a way to make the money leave the system again as theres no government to throw it in an incinerator
supported at least for bpcs this game excels and is built around the players there is no more reason fundemental equipment like this should be npc produced anymore then bss should be npc produced other isk sinks will have to be found could just remove insurance v0v thatd be a big help but that shouldnt be something keeping an out of place implementation where it doesnt belongput them in exploration sites in low sec or below missioning really doesnt need anymore boosts then it already has
dear ccp obvious fix to problem is to load grid before spawning the players ship on grid

why because a single right click is too straining there are other far more important issues that need to be dealt with
i think the only real reason anyone wants this is because they hate the fact that they go into a system and right away their target warps to a safe spot or docks up now they lose their killmail personally in respect to the lore of the game the jumpgates you use to get to a system keeps a record of the pilot and sends the information accordingly just because pilots have gotten smarter and its harder for you to go after your target you want to overhaul a system first aspect they have to be paying attention to local then this is where you suggest that everyone pay attention to local or that its stupid not to well those stupid people pay the price after losing their ships if not using local then how about a system that links up the pilot with a stargate letting them see the last people who used it to enter and leave and uploads it to local in all actuality ive never been a fan of if you use the gates then you dont appear in local the whole talking is useless since no one really says anything in local except people who need their epeen tickled local will be what it is in wh dead no one ever talks in local unless they want to die i am a fan of if you use your jump bridge then you should not appear in local since you used an alternative motive to enter the system that is not recorded by the jumpgate systemhowever what you suggesting is to make it easier for pirates to kill people and to set up traps since everyone has gotten pretty smart about travel in low sec and 00if you take out the local system then you have to give everyone an alternative motive that works just as well and letting everyone know who just entered the system since this goes against what your actualy motive of staying completely hidden to get the drop its not going to work im really sleepy i hope all that i said made sense dont know why i post when im about to go to sleep thats my 2 cents
i like the idea of delayed local or a local that can be turned off i posted in this idea a while ago it was fun and tbh something i would love to see happen i would be intrested in seeing what the op thinks about it or anyone else in heremean while i support this idea provided a tool for gathering intel is put in place maybe a local scanner that always displays how many people are in system or switching local for constellation chat tbh i would rather see the idea in this link happen but overall local being removed as an intel tool would be a good thingedit tbh its not always about the next kill mail sure some want it for that others want it so there is more to warfare then seeing 80 in local and knowing you need to bring at least 90 of your own to win
the game mechanics r already heavily in favor of the attacker removing local would only make it worse cause the attackers will simply assume that there r targets in every system and once they scan u down ure dead because u wont know theyre there but they know ure there as a result this will only backfire when no one without an entire army watching their back will go into low sec or 00 then all the gankers will be left with r other gankers to gank avoiding the last scenario is probably the only reason removing local was suggested but once again it wont workas for the 90 to kill 80 issue locals not the problem the game mechanics r set up to heavily favor strength in numbersthats why ppl blob and outblob other blobs if they have the numbers for it
you obviously arent in 00 85 of the systems are empty of the 15 that arent 10 of those have 14 people afk at a pos 4 are in station systems docked and afk1 are actually out doing somethingi can take your scenario and say this attacker goes system to system finding nothing after 2 hours they finally spot you and your friends however you see them coming in on your scanner and warp offeither way if you are wise you live
only ure not taking a tour of every single 00 system in the universe so whos gonna say the system ure going to isnt infested by pirates ure sure as hell not gonna find out til its too late sure u can see them coming in on your scannerif theyre 14 au or closer while their scan probes scout the entire system and u mash that scan button every single second and by the time u spot an interceptor hit hit warp to 0 once while u spam scan scan scan over 9000 times u have what up to 35 seconds to escape before u get tackled now how im not describing 00 why dont u try running that scenario first its a lot more common
i do in wspace all the time had a couple drakes get away from our small gang just the other nightsee you are one of those that uses local for intel and a warning when to run away you give the impression that you want to hide from reds not actually counter themthat will remain the difference youre prey you will fight anything that scares you or enhances the unknown you fear uncertanty
i can agree that we need a better way to see enemys coming in boost the dscanner range or something else that allow sov holders to know how many people are in system but not who is in system this could be a new reason to reintroduce the system scanner arrays for poss what ideas would you have to improve the idea of removing local or setting it in a delayed mode do you think the idea as a whole is bad or just the lack of intel for the defending side have you considered that the enemys will be risking just as much if there happens to be a fleet waiting for them do you think the enemy not knowing if you are there can be an effective defense for ratters and miners
1 even with no local u couldnt catch them thats your fault then2 how exactly does countering reds work when ure in a pve ship3 must be real scary and uncertain for u to scan down the whole system and know exactly who and how many is in the system4 sounds like u just want easier kills like the others cause u couldnt even catch 1 of those 2 battlecruisers with no local assisting them
1 the idea of a delayed local is all the time they need to bubble the gates by the time u notice them or at least jump in quick scan jump out2 have u considered that the enemy is pvp fit and will be a lot more prepared to fightrun from enemy fleets than a ratter in a pve fit not much risk when theres covert ops scouts scanning for all the intel thats needed and interceptor tacklers able to gauge the situation firsthand and retreat if its not favorable3 the enemy will still know via scan probes local is not the only way a pirate will know a targets present do u ever mention that
i might not get this thing rightare you referring tolagas in latencyor to lag as inlow frames per secondlag is an old term that illiterate and ignorant kids have started misusing in place of jitter for exampleagain lag equals latency in the well established network jargon of computer sciencewhich one are you referring to pharon
considering that from a server standpoint activating a module is probably something likegigar activated group of 8x 425mm railgun is on targetcompressedgigar activated 8g 425mm railgun i targetim not network engineer but im pretty sure that theres not really anything you can do in this part
and then ofcourse sending all that information to everyone on the grid witch could be skipped imo fact is if you have 2 players on the field every event that would generate an effect would be sent to eachother so server will have to send 2 packets if you have 100 players there will be 100x100 packets as every move that generates a graph update will be sent to all of the players fact is that things grow exponentially  not linear ofc what iv done is maybe the simpliest possible model but it should give an ideea might worth investigating
you are correct in the conclusion that the algorithmic complexity scales exponentially with player count nxn yet your proposal is assuming that sending the data to all involved parties on a grid is a main bottleneck while that process takes some computational resources the main computational load and the one responsible for lag is simply running the simulation for all objectsentities in a system even if you stop sending the data to the clients the server still has to compute the whole simulation so little is gainedand finally the way the simulation engine works makes your proposal impossiblethe server runs the simulation for the whole system while the client only simulates the subset also known as the grid the engine is deterministic and assumes that both server and client will result in the exact same simulation remember the devblog explaining desync desync is what happens when server and client reach different results in the simulation because of a bug for instance now if you stop sending vital simulation info to the client it cannot even get the same result which contradicts the simulation engine conceptand like pointed out turning off effects only reduces the stress on the client ofcalso you might be interested in reading my little analysis on the lag problem discussion on fighting lag
first of all some data are essential  as where are the ships headed if they enter warp state or not or if they get destroyed  when they enter the grid and from what direction your level of hp ill just call it hp current targets or ppl in watchlist level of hp as far as lets say all the participants level of hp im shure they update dinamically when requested ie when you actually target someone the information determining an effect of pew pew between third party and third party on my client does not seem to be vital in regarding to maintaining sync as all the information will readibly available when actually necesaryi do not make the asumption that comunication betwen server and client regarding effects is a main bottleneck but it shure does hav an impact on performance i do however make the asumption that most pilots engaged in large scale combat turn off mos of their effect for fps  uaually called client side lag but technically its fps so if thats true if if cutting it off from the server helps even in a few percent improvement why not having it cut off from server beeing what it is an nxn function  computational resources will easily dry out no matter of given hardware as in a year maybe from now well have probably 1000 to 1000 fights reducing complexity by cutting off some of the less vital functions is one way to deal wit itparalelising operations comes in mind as you outlined but that opens a whole new pandora box regarding desync bugs and exploits as it happens with all current modernday os kernelsps im now in process of reading all developer blogs that could be related and help me understand more of the internals still its a tedious task if anyone can point into the one that adresses those issues id appreciate
the difference in computational load for sending a message meaning you lost 100hp to sending one meaning player b hit you for 100hp is minimal and that message is enough for the client to trigger a visual effect missls and drones are different but you get the pointand who decides when a fleet is big and the measures should be applied what if the effects are crucial for determining the best course of action in a fleet battle correctno if the function wasnt vital it wouldnt have been introduced in the first place divide and conquer to manage complexitythreading isnt generally the cause of exploits but sure the increased performance threading can bring comes at a cost code complexity qa etc if you can guarantee that the result of your multithreaded code is deterministic no new desync issues are introducedthis one is quite interesting on desyncand a general collection of links to different technology blogs updates
true but i wasnt refering to that as it is now you are geeting a message that player c is shooting at player d with is generating an effect of lazorz from player c to player d you are not targeting either of them and neither of them are in watch list so what do we care server load after a certain threshold it should go that way im shure that in fights with 1  2 minutes module lag tactical decisions are much more less if not at all taken upon effects having them all enabled on any but the top line computers is already making the game mostly unplayable trying to figure witch of the 300 enemy dots is shooting what or for that matter repearing or having a sensor booster activated  and taking decisions based on that dosent seem reasonable to me whats true for small scale isnt for large scale and vice versa if lag wouldnt be a problem and wed all use alienware computers effects might be more tan just eyecandy in large scale but as it is now lag is the worst problem btw i have yet to come across an alliance that would instruct their members to have effects  turrets  missile effects on during large fleets if any of those exists id like to know but as currently is fleet standatd setup is to shut them off no  its never bad programing is source of bugs and bugs are source of exploits still introducing the complexity paralelising would mean we are to be expected to have alot of bugs im shure ccp have excelent programmers but as with all the software industry they do have timelines deadlines and not enough or not upto scale testing thanx for the links 
the thing is probably you client need to know who fired on you anyway because you hp has to decrease yes sure get rid of sensor boosters and stuff if it does not effect the battle itself under conitions when a node is strained
i too support ramblings that may or may not have any grain of truth in them because i am computer god and know everything about every system in the worldwhy hasnt anyone told ccp about lag yet im sure it can be fixed by three button pushes why wont they push the three buttons to fix itserious thought dont you think ccp is aware of lag they have some top end hardware its not like the jury rigged a bunch of old apple 2s together maybe the problem is that eve is an evolving piece of code one of the most ambitious projects marketed hmmm maybe

i am sorry to inform you that i dont like your ideas has nothing to do with you
i dont tolerate stupidity and imbecility and your proposal has no value for those of us smart enough never needing to warp out and back into a mission pocket i can only see the need in case you are one of those losers who have to frequently run like a chicken because you didnt plan well before going into the heat of battleor if you have frequent disconnects which i never have so there must be something wrong with your pc or internet service provider and in both cases youre stupid for not taking care of the problem yourselfa third possibility could be that you are horrible at planning your time and end up having to leave a mission before it is completed again a case of your own lack of abilityin fact think of the long slow traveling time you must endure crossing an empty deadspace pocket you have already cleared as the punishment you must receive due to your intellectual deficiencies we dont reward idiotic behavior around here no sir

as we all know the problem is the abuse blacklisted corporations alliances or pilots would not help with it because within a few minutes everyone can create an alt put in wherever he wants and do the deedmy proposal to have a hefty skill requirement to be able to accept bounty contracts might make that a bit more difficult though because with this it is not done with just a few days of training but every serious pirate would then have a trained bounty hunter to collect the bounties on him within an npc corporationthe mechanic that the acceptance of a contract by a bounty hunter needs to be confirmed by the contract issuer would not eliminate that risk but would limit it once known a rogue bounty hunter would not be able to get another contract and weeks of training would be wasted on a then mostly useless character
would not change the present system as soon as a bounty is issued fly to a slow highsec system and get killed by the own alt or a friend

currently if you have a skill in training you can queue up unrelated skills no problemhowever if you have a skill in training that is a prereq for another skill the followon skill can not be added to the queue because it cant even be injected i propose changing the inject skill routine by removing the check to see if you are eligible to train the skilljust do not let a person actually train the skill til the prereq is met allow the followon skill to be added to the queue after the last prereqas it stands now whenever i have a skill that has a prereq i have to wait til the entire skill queue is drained then add the followon
sounds good and cant hurt anyone either
upported but depending on how eve is coded this might not be realizable
ive requested this on a number of occasions and it did make it past csms little gauntlet but no word on whether it passed or not
ill support thisif the system is looking at our attributes and such to calculate training time which i can only assume it as as opening the training window andor editing the queue seems to always take some time why cant there be a check for prerequisites being in queue when adding a skill or removing one the skills that require a prerequisite already in queue could be highlighted somehow to emphasize them
supported again
hopefully this is as simple as it sounds within the codingsupported
i laugh just a little bit harder when a killmail has expensive books destroyed on itso not supported
i am against this idea solely on the grounds that your proposed idea would completely remove the need for a person to go and spend time planning their queue when theyll buy books etcwith your suggestion i would be able to buy every skillbook there is inject every single one of them and then train them once i qualifyeven if you limit it to inject skills with prereqs being trained i could easily buy 5 books requiring one skill and then inject them all then say screw it and change my queue to something else entirely and this doesnt even consider if the prereq skill in queue would be required to be the level or the skill alonewe have a 24h queue can we not just be happy we have it or would you rather go back to no injecting at all and 0 queue at all
do people ever think before they postor is that read
did youmy previous concerns and stance on the subject is based on the exact proposal and look beyond what it does immediately but also how itll impact other things
okthen itll check to see if the skill still requires a prerequisite and if part of the queue gets cancelled everything that wont be valid afterwards will be gone like if someone tried to delete weapon upgrades lvl 5 before the injection of advanced weapon upgrades minor tweak and its good no big dealwhy do ppl want to nerf the queue so badly
because their are underlying issues lets take your suggested solution you just cancelled an entire queue included prerequisites and an inject skill using the original idea what happens to the injected skill you no longer qualify foris it removed completely destroyed and youve now lost the isk for the bookis it removed a book created for the skill appearing in your inventory ship or stationwhat if your inventory is full when this happens is the book never created at allhow would you prevent this from being used by people who can now transport books across the galaxy without fear of loosing themand if you say no you just keep it either based on the fact you were previously training a prerequisite then stopped or because of the suggested change youve still gotpeople loading a prereq skill inject 5 books then cancel and keep skillpeople buying all skills they can afford inject them and never worry about having to fetch books transporting them until they can learn them etcand if you say then you cant delete prereq skills and injected from the queue you end up withpeople who may make a mistake and cannot change their queueits not nerfing the queue nerfing implies making it worst you are talking about buffing it talking about not buffing it is not the same as nerfing now if i said just take away injecting thats a nerf cutting it down to 12 hours thats a nerf arguing for not buffing something is not a cry for nerfingso im sorry but as it stands i still cannot support the idea for buffing something which doesnt need a buff compare what we have now with what we had before and tell me if it still needs more buffing and no its more convenient is not a good enough reason or wed have had the training queue years ago
definitely would like this to happen there have been quite a few time where i would have made use of it instead of being forced to cue up another less pressing skill and leave it till i got backit ads functionality to the design and takes nothing away
the actual injection will not occur until the queue reaches the point where its supposed to be injected which means if its cancelled it will never reach the point of injection when it does reach the point of injection it will check to see if u have the book in one of your ships cargo hold or station hangar if not it will not inject and the queue will pause no exploit no being stuck on a queuing mistake were not trying to do this as an exploit were trying to do this as a convenience its exactly like injecting them manually when when the time comes only u dont have to log on when ure not able to at the time to do so thats talking about nerfing might wanna replay that explanation to yourselfso what other reason do u have to not buff queuing does it hurt u in any way
supportedif you inject a skillbook and then dont train the prereqs then just make it so that the injected skill wont train until they are met
support it especially when i see what damage those raventorpedoes dobut why need hardwiring implants need fixed slots why cant they be neutral an implant at the wrong place doesnt bring any use

i support this idea its much needed
only if yellow wrecks can be tractored and only for 15 minutes
what happened to the op once all those ccp gms and devs were quoted regarding salvage rights he stopped respondingobviously gms and devs are wrong and the op is right so where is he
if you can steal the wrecks without concord interference you should just be able to steal the cans too its a completely artificial definition on the part of ccp the loot in the cans is stuff you managed to salvage from the destroyed ship its amusing to me that concord would consider you a criminal for taking 100 ammo that was sitting in a broken rail gun but be completely okay with your snatching the broken rail gun itself to sell not supported but my point stands
ty for all the responses everyone has been giving me to my post ive seen several good ideaspoint yet ive also seen several bad onesfirst off all drones are governed by the drone skill et why would anyone think that a salvager drone wouldnt be governed by the same skill setfor example the drones skill would naturally govern how many salvager drones would b able to be implimented the same for any other kind of dronethe drone interfacing skill could have a patch on it increasing the percentage of sucessfully salvaging since it has the percentages for mining and damage increase or make a drone salvaging skill to specifically govern the chance to sucessfully salvage as has been done for mining drones with the mining drone operation skillthe scout drone operation skill governs the range of that particular class of drone a similar skill can be created to govern the range of a salvager dronethe point is throwing an idea out on how to make a salvager drone work isnt going to solve anything there has to be some semblence of checkandbalance to the whole thing
somebody wrote a lot of technical stuff about entitys and children in the backseat further up what if salvager drones instead of having their own cargohold just jetison everything immediately then you can use tractor beam to get it into your cargo would the salvager drone still go are we there yet
im not sure if im remembering this rightbut i recall a dev saying that they didnt want us to have salvage drones because salvaging should be something that you have to consciously think about doing and chose to do and they didnt want salvaging to be an automated task
as a ninja salvager i support the idea of a nano vexorishkur with full rack of salvager 2s and a flight of salvage drones
supported i also like the idea of tractor drones

yeah im all for the autostack not so much the auto repeat
nice job on the csm being read up on game mechanics this was fixed in a previous patch the launcher will now load from multiple stacks
it would still be nice to have them auto stack
the problem with fw is that people dont live in the space they control and their is no leadership the plexing mechanic doesnt support fleets or commitment and most importantly the money making mechanic is both unsafe and isnt tied to the territory holding mechanic1 there needs to be a way to create an offical coalition between corporation ie an alliance to create a large community with a clear leadership strucute to with the mindset of controlling territory2 taking dungeons can often be done with few people allowing one person or a small group to take an entire system an inty for example can often fly much faster than the weapons of the npcs can hit them meaning one person can fly around the beacon forever with little danger instead the beacons should probably be changed so that its health has to be taken to zero and with a reinforce timer and possible all beacons have to be captured in x amount of time 3 the top issue with fw is that conquering territory has little to do with who lives in the territory and how those who live there make their money in 00 alliances are often fighting for resources such as belts moons rats etc and have to live in those areas to make sure they have quick access to it in fw conquering a territory doesnt provide them resources or control the militia cant prevent enemy milita from using the stations and controlling the moons doesnt mean much and the rats and belts are all that great either therefore a militia needs access to new valuable resources by conquering territory so that they ahve both reason to defend conquer and populate their systems
clearly this is a nuanced and enlightened view that you have come to after great amounts of effort there is a lot of interest in fw from those within as well as from those without who open up threads every week asking how fw is the sheer amounts of threads on the subject of flawed fw mechanics is enough to belie your trite and pointless statementanyways threads dealing with fw here linky and here and here
if you feel like you are wasting time then why do it offensive plexes can be rather lucrative isk wise loads of tags especially from larger mediums and majors plus the mod drops  several million per plex easyuse the probes to scan out exploration sites while babysitting timer bookmark them and run them afterwards huge money to be made from the right sitesthis man pretty much hit the nail bang on there are so many bugs and flawed mechanics that any salvage operation is doomed to fail miserablyevery bug they have squashed so far has introduced multiple new ones and almost every change they make to eve not related to fw introduces bugs  the mashup of code they used to create the thing ties into so many aspects of eve that you cant fix itshut it down and redo the whole damn thing and then start up againnot supported

obviously this is mainly for those fleet fights going over 1000 pilots in one place right now by what i understand from what i read is that they can migrate resources so one system can get its own node to help fight off the lag while other nodes might have 610 system in them since they arent as active since fleet fights are getting so bad that one node for a single system isnt enough why not change the node structure completely you could make it so one spot at system would have its own node since fleet battles are usually all over the system it should make fleet fights more bearable with less lag spikes or complete disconnectiontldr make nodes for spaces inside the system instead of one for the whole systemedited2 me made an erroragain
they dont even have multi threaded node code nor dynamic redistribution of nodes reinforcing is done at downtime and you expect something advanced like that to workanyway grids are instanced dynamically all over the place its not like they are spawned statically so you cant have one server per grid lets assume they are spawned upfront and shared among multiple servers the amount of needed hardware would be not feasible
the grid is a per client concept the node always computes the simulation for a whole system the computational model isnt anywhere near the granularity you are suggestingalso you might be interested in reading my little analysis on the lag problem discussion on fighting lag
officially not supporting this year old piece of failure eve allows you to have multiple characters on your account and unlike other mmos it isnt to experience part of the game one of them cannot due to their raceclass etc as any character can train any skill in eve that makes people run around in alts doing all the things they dont want associated with their real charactercorp changing names would make that worse

i dont mind the war decs though just one more problem with the standing system as it currently exists
since we have the ability allow alliance members the ability to anchor unanchor online and offline any type of module on our towers is it really that hard to add the ability to allow alliance members to man starbase guns seriously how was this glossed over and still has not been attended to by the devs just a simple checkbox under the defense tab or a rolebased list similar to other structure actions would solve this nightmarish problem
upon switching to page 2 i found this
so there i wasi come up to the sobaseki in my bantam halffull of salvagei warp in and see a yellow wreck with a full hold i open it up and see combat accessories i go to loot them and bam im poddi limp into the station and wonder what happened after a few moments of calming down i gather all the materiel needed to manufacture a new bantam and throw it all into my kestreli undock and no sooner am i out of the stationbam bam poddso i limp to another station and get an ibis the defaulted rookie ship for caldari and get the salvager i that i had bought while gathering the materiel to reconstruct my now lost bantami come back to the station with the salvager on the ibis and theres a bs lurking outside the station destroying concord and taking potshots at pcs i ask for my stuff back and the bs says here catch and tosses me a yellow cargo container with my original salvager i and the 3 expanded cargohold iis that were on my original bantami start to loot this cargo container thinking this nice guy isnt going to kill me if i loot it cuz of him handing it too me and bam there goes the ibisthe point of this isi propose that the aggression counter cease after the first podding and not run a whole 15 minutes and the offended pc be allowed to pod people the whole 15 minutes per offense
umright soim going to assume this is a troll for the following reasons1 you dont tank or destroy concord no one does their entire purpose is to wtfbbqpwn you and they are very good at it2 people in a 08 system do not take pot shots at other people unless said other people have done something stupid  like you did when you looted a yellow wreck and took from a cargo container that wasnt yoursseriously the aggression counter is working as intended you just need to learn how what that means
i myself have really always hated killmails they arent really accurate and people can mess with it a lot so in turn it just becomes something for another person to gain without any real substance to the game people should have proof of a kill though in times when japan was in great war to get paid soldiers were told to bring the heads of the people they killed to get paid it was exploited by people coming in and taking off the heads of the ones who were left however this cant really happen here all too much since people really want that head pirates want a juicy kill mail the fact that there is someone wanting a way to seal the deal on it is proof enough as it is i for one would suggest making podding easier without the huge risk to sp loss factor this way your proof is the closet full of dead bodies you have piled up in your room again killmails can be false and messed with to either make someone looks stronger or weaker then they really are however having the corpse of a known pirate who is really good at what they do says something doesnt it i dont know just my idea really this way you get rid of the killmail junkies since if they kill someone who really doesnt have a name then no one really cares and its not just a number anymore its not how many kills but essentially who you kill my 2 cents anywaysedit but then comes in the problem on how to become famous since the whole bounty system is ed up oh wellagain 2 cents
reread what i said as a suggestionwe do not need a new shipwe have a perfectly balanced and mighty fine platform to use that being the mining bargesexhumerswhat we need is a strip miner for gas mining much like ice harvestersand because gas is so light make it only usable on the procuror or the skiff or somethingto make a new ship brings in a can of worms people have there own take on things and balancing is a nightmareso am i antigas no im all for it but not when it makes things ridiculously easyuse what we got dont reinvent the wheeland i meant no offense but seriously its way to much work and effort keep it simple

yo eternalim not into fw or missions but it seems clear that that one example is rather odd and unsuitable for new players i would however ask of you that you formulate your proposal more clearly than you have currently
actually there are reasons with packingunpacking from a player side is has to do with space packaged things usually take up less space than unpackaged ones unpackaged ones can also be affected by damage and in theory at least other effects from a serverside by having the two seperated it save s a bit of database space as for all those that are packaged you dont need to know anything about it other than its reference item and how many of them there arethere isnt though a good reason that i can see that it doesnt autopackage undamagedunmodified equipment when loaded into cargohangers
im voting yesits only fair and normal if you hit other players in what is a relativley safe area of the game to have a downside what is out of normal is to do that and proffit from it triple one in having fun griefing two in the loot from the poor bastard and third in the form of inshurancefact is that you dont care so much about the min prices as noone really cares im happy with them being low  more bses for me you care only to be helped to keep grief people and maximise your proffit in that with no actual loss well its time for a change 
now that i see all the ships i dont think this is a problem except on the caracal none of the other ships that can fit undersized weapons ever do unless im mistaken
i think the bonus on light for cara for example is so that assult missile launchers get bonusedassaults are cruiser weapons just as medium electronsionsneuts are cruiser weaponsbecause the ammo gets bonused on cal ships instead of the guns it does mean that a cara fitting standard launchers would get bonused on bloodclaws from them launchersi dont think many cara pilots would fit standards instead of assaults as assault are allready very easy fittingslooking at the fix i have proposed  the cara would get its rof  dpl bonus to assaultsheavysheavy assaults all cruiser based weaponsso any lol standard launcher fitted caras would of course have to fight without a bonus
haha you have this completely the wrong way round it is a benefit  it means that the pilot does not need to invest a few weeks training to gain the damage that the ship is balanced around instead he gets the damage output that the ship is balanced around as soon as he can fly it yet you want to punish the pilot by making him have to train weeks of skills to achieve the combat effectiveness ordained by ship balance considerations for shame

bad quote sorry
as you continue to not understand what i am talking about i will try to explain many inhabitants of lowsec and i mean the people who really live there spend more time fighting in large battles against rivals than in little smaller gangs of pirates yes there are people who gatecamp and quite frankly ive never understood the attraction to it it is boring but each to their ownyes we ar ecriminals but we fight the other criminals and antipirates that is how lowsec really aught to be not a place where carebears yes there are craebears in lowsec but tghey should be in organisations that can defend themall i ever see is small minded people moaning that lowsec isnt safe for carebears no it isnt it isnt supposed to beim not interested in making lowsec more attractive to cxarebears so they can be ganked what i am suggesting is that lowsec should be a place where criminals fight their rivals where antipirates and bounty hunters go to hunt their quarry where smugglers make their fortune it isnt like hisec it isnt like 00 even npc 00 it is where the criminals and outlaws of empire livei bet if i made a post saying lowsec should have concord and much better rewards for carebears and some ore that makes twice what hisec gets you emo guys would be like hell yeah well you have those places hisec and get some nice safe 00 and go mine there leave lowsec to the people who actually want it to be dangerous and darkso to reacp none of this post is to encourage more carebears for gankingand i agree with the gate guns thing yeah it would be unbalanced to not have them shoot however i wasnt thinking about interceptors since we can boost a hic up to a scan res of well over a thousand to do that job and with an infinite point so no again i wasnt thinking about ganking carebears
i agree that low sec needs some love as a pve carebear i need some good reasons to give it a go apart from being an easy kill mail for an ebil piwatethere was a black market skill but ccp took it out and never put it back in it was one of reasons under the old character creation system to make an intaki commercial pilot with high charisma as they were supposed to get this from the start blackmarket and smuggling skills combined with cloak and transports could give a very lucrative profession of smuggler taking these dodgy goods from low to hi secsomeone on the fringe between criminal and empire perhaps add a npc bribe skill giving you a chance of docking where you normally could notthe problem i think is that low sec has become synonymous with lawless whereas it should have been more about free market enterprise brave new frontier and no big government on your back somewhere for the little guy to make his mark instead it is all about sov and alliances bullying the little guy worse than the empire bureaucrats and tax collectorsno wonder many people dont want to go there
anything to set lowsec apart from highsec is fine by me we need more people to live theresome of the ideas you have do not however take into account that it is still empire just not patrolled as diligently as highsec1 sentries are concord and thus not avoidable would be a bit much as well  better to give huge discounts on pos fuel consumption station services costs perhaps an increase in sec gain from rats in systems and a dividend skimmed off market transaction fees2 no grind lp for fancy now godly faction boats in relative safety compared to 00 agents34 the amount of contraband in game doesnt warrant it a nightmare having been captured and recommissioned to do good instead of evil why would the empires object  it is the ultimate slap in the pirate factions faces 5 smuggling has never really existed its a nice idea not really lowsec but rather highsec related since that is where the enforcement isperhaps tie it into 1 allowing free passage of goods into the highsec system bordering a haven move npc buy orders around to make several juicy possible routes6 wouldnt special encounter sites be better maybe even a spinoff of the pirate magnet system upgrade thingie you need to figure out how system dominance is obtained and held first though you ideally want a mechanic where different corporations fight over control of the most valuable systems similar to 00
ccp mentioned pirate factions getting involved in faction war i suspect that this would be linked to their other ideas of viceroys maybe ultimately allowing piratealigned capsuleers to take control of losec systemsccp destroyed the real black market and smuggling occupation when it allowed placement of illegal items such as slaves and boosters onto the regular marketso for some of your proposal push forward with pirate faction warfare remove the ability to put illegal items onto the regular market in hisec space put a couple of pirate agents into space in lolosec systems maybe 01 or 02 sec
please fix rockets to actually be capable of applying dps to things of their class so they can become a respectable weapon instead of a cheap supplemental weapon for the turret shipsthe vengeance for example needs to do some dps and it would be a very nice ship amarr need one good af

im a simple guyi dont know about adding most of this proposal though there is no doubt at all that changes are needed check out this thread for a long standing list of proposals most of which are better than thissay hello to my little friends
this sounds like a great way of sidestepping jammersdamps lock time etcdo you need target locks on your targets before you can assign the order to kill them if no then your idea is way overpoweredif yes what happens when you get jammeddamped out of range  do you lose all the assignment numbers engaging targets of choice should only be possible if you have a target locksome of the other stuff like  closestfirst  furtherst first seems reasonablebut attack ecm boats first is most definateely not okyou have just givin drone boats the ability to kill ewar boats even if those ewar boats get effictive jamsdamps on you
as a fw pilot whos run his fair share of fw missions let the carebears be carebears and run lowsec missions if and when they so choose
for a shipping firm thats usually delivers package in a tranquil town have to obligatorially do a delivery in rebel controlled iraq by route from somali coast or lose weeks of work its not fun at all
many solutions to these egregious storyline missions have been offered here
thanks for answering my questionsit sounds very brokenfix it
these new storyline missions are a waste of time ccp how many peeps are rejecting this mission how many are succeeding  just saying these do stand out like a pile of sht at the dinner table
ccp decided to make dust 514 for consoles stop whining and start dealing with itplease ccp close this thread its getting us nowhereend of message
hellooooo dust merc clansseriously the amount of butthurt in this thread is just sickening wah wah ccp made a game specifically designed to attract people who dont play eve but its not perfect for people who do play eve and i love playing eve so very very much that i will quit playing eve because i cant play another game everything ccp do should be for me me me me me me me me me me meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
the op pointed out cod4id like to point out the fact there is no online fps that does not or has not had some form of aiming assist hacks or the ability to do other things that dont constitute normal gameplayif youre found using the keyboardmouse kit for the 360 your live account gets bannedbecause of this all players are essentially left playing with the exact same controls which levels at least one playing field control interfacethe hardware is exactly the same across the board giving everyone exactly the same visual effects some of which have tacticalgameplay related uses such as flashbangs causing a hazy view after the initial blinding effect  an effect commonly possible to disable whether through the games options or through modification of the gameconsole commands on pc versions because the graphics and performance are the same for everyone this levels another playing field hardwaremy own 360 is broken and my pc is ancient  i cannot afford to replace either but i for one would rather this game stay on the 360 alone because this would give the most stable balanced playing field for all those playing it while on the ps3 where it was pointed out to me mousekeyboard is possible for some games or on the pc control devices the potential for hackingcheating and for gameplay disparity between those with high performance vs low performance machines could cause issuesi cant support the ops suggestion
this finally has a proper response out of ccp
pretty good idea never thought of that supported
itd be nice if this were implementedbut its hardly a pressing matter
supported
supported ice caps would be nice on some of the planets too
tbh i agree with mails going to pos gunners but i disagree with alliance level pos control so im supporting this proposal
supported
back to the top because this needs fixed for dominion 11 please
tbh it isnt the eris it is all roden shipyard ships that need a goal they are supposed to be missile ships yet in reality they get some horrible split weapon system isnt necesarily bad but with the resulting ships it usually is
in my experience the macroers never left ive got petitions from last summer against obvious bot miners and guess what  every time i see one of those characters and ive seen pretty much all of them in the last 2 months months later theyre still bot mining away unholy rage was about rmt traders  any macro users it got rid of appear to have been removed only in that they were connected with rmt types as far as the mineral pricing trends for the last year other than pyro mineral prices now are pretty close to what they were a year ago  the runup was most likely due to a major demand increase after the major war goodswarm and others were involved in last spring that saw thousands of ships dying the pyro runup from what i see as the head of a miner corp is apparently due to a scarcity of scordite in the belts moreorless with dominion  my roomies that specifically work scordite are constantly running out of rocks before anyone else is despite our deliberate decidion to have an equal number and close to equally skilled set of miners working each rock type except pyro value on that has dropped to much to make it worthwhile unless we run out of everything else
damn too many topics for the same thingi wrote here my view
thats outside of the scope of this thread and in any case i strongly oppose it losing a ship should be sufficient punishment its not up to ccp to add extra penalties to stop people who play in ways you dont like your proposal would make suicide ganking completely pointless please remember that eve is founded on the principle of nonconsensual pvp if you want to effectively remove suicide ganking you need to match that proposal with some other method and make your own proposal this one is about how insurance is calculated not under what conditions it is paid nor is it about nerfing suicide gankingin any case no realistic insurance company would ever insure a pod pilots ship there can never be anything remotely realistic about ship insurance in eve as real insurance companies take more in premiums than they pay out in compensations this is why it is also foolish to expect any kind of playerrun insurance to be widely applicablerealism is a poor reason to do something compared to game balance at the moment the insurance system is both unrealistic and unbalanced my proposal is that it should be unrealistic and balanced
qftinsurance is not the problem the problem is supply  demand in the mineral market driving prices down to the insurance floor the mineral supply has been buffed again  again over the years exhumers t2 strips drone regions whs better  better gear to steam roll lv4s buffed hisec belts  now buffed 00 belts nothing has been done to increase demandedit the addition of caps  super caps is an increase to demand as mineral prices show its not enough to keep up with supplyfix the mineral supplydemand ratio and insurance will be no more problem than it was years ago
supported hell even 56kb would be better the quality improvement is astounding ive chosen to switch from one of my old sigs back to a more simple one because of the limit
this would be pretty much at the bottom of any imaginary list i would make prioritizing the proposals on this boardnot supported they are just signatures
yup
not supported its a forum the images are not needed now nor do they need to be larger the steam forums dont allow sigs and there just fine
drake draconisthe risk needs to stay in the game not get nerfed out of itid say the risk is still there actually think of it more ppl doing ap more risk  you can see em 15 k out and take them on i did not say i was afk i said autodock on ap while i do ap i am close by just not actively jumpinganyway 6 supports out of 14 is okay for my suggestion i sayagain you can do infomorph jump but you cant make you ship dock at first station seriously  why notthanks for you input bagehi but how are you going to drag 900 k m3 with you in that jumpas it is i have naturally stopped doing this kind of transporting as it kills my enjoyment for the game
not supportedyour lazy ass can stay at the gate till downtime if youre that dumb
your missing the pointstop thinking about yourself and start thinking of otherspeople will not use the ap system the way you think it will be used surely youve thought of that
drake draconisyour missing the pointstop thinking about yourself and start thinking of otherspeople will not use the ap system the way you think it will be used surely youve thought of thatsure i been here long enough to know that if anything can be abused misused or f up  it will be no doubt about it thats the fun part i can come up with lots of reason to use it and why not possibly but here i am throwing it up and hopes that something reasonable will be returned instead of just negative bs not directed at you offcourse i appriciate all constructive input also those that tell me why not to use it if thought through so far only the reason i can not use it as it might prevent ganking also initially i can see that it was propposed for freighters but will be misued by all other ship types
there is currently a gap in ccp policy covering reimbursement for losses cause by account expiration whilst in game whilst the game time remaining is displayed on the character selection screen it is small print and most pilots will simply click through that screen quickly drawn straight away to the pilot selection portraits on the left whilst those purchasing shorter game time blocks may be more aware of how much time they have left those on the longer blocks can easily miss it and thus the potential exists not just for them to lose ships in a manner not within the spirit of the game but also those flying with them and depending on themmy proposal involves two simple elements that can prevent such instances from occurring to the benefit of both the eve pilot community and the gms who have to receive such petitions firstly a mechanism already exists in eve to notify pilots of the count down to down time i am certain that this mechanism can be easily copied and adapted to count down the last 24 hours of a pilots account time in the same manner perhaps with in game reasoning being a concord advisory broadcast that the pilot license is about to expire this would give visible pop up warnings at the following timings that no pilot could missless than 24 hoursless than 12 hoursless than 6 hoursless than 3 hoursless than 1 hoursless than 30 min less than 15 minless than 5 minslast 60 seconds counted downsecondly as a visual prompt on the login screen to draw attention to the low account time remaining i propose a flashing red backlight glow to the main character portrait on the character selection screen should the account time remaining be less than 24 hours or alternatively the actual account time remaining flash red as well as preventing accidental losses these steps will also enable those not on recurring subscriptions to make sure their accounts topped up just before they run out ensuring continuityorhan
i happen to like this idea it would be nice to be reminded when my times about to completly expire as so not to loss anything also its just nice to be reminded to pay my bill when i need to
i support the idea orhan i will bring it upz0d

1 the same goes for defense once someone gets killed which would happen regardless because lets face it people are slow then you know the fleet is there there is no longer the question if a hostile fleet is there2 have you ever considered that maybe ratters have it to easy and should be fitting for pvp and staying in the same systems with each other and showing teamwork an enemy seeing a fleet of ships in a system are less likely to attack in the first place if they think the odds are bad3 there is no reason a pve ship cant fit a scan probe launcher and still be an effective pve ship your able to scan the whole system every 10 sec you should already be aligned and ready to warp when you see someone show up on your scanner so getting out shouldnt be an issue its going to take more then 10 sec no matter were they warp in from to warp to you they could be on grid and it will take more then 10 sec before they can lock you 4 do you think it should be easy to afk rat and mine in 00 all the time and provided a way for sov holders to see the number of pilots in system but not the pilots would you support that instead of just a delayed local
1 if its a lone ratter its not gonna matter when hes the someone getting killed2 ratters have it too easy against warp bubbles heavy interdictors interceptors covert ops frigates and whatever else a 00 blob can bring that pvp fittings sure gonna counter that warp jam ewar webify enemy logistics neutralize oh u still died but hey u survived a few seconds longerits a new record theres no teamwork in soloing nor is there fleeting oh wait ure forcing ppl to fleet up to even play the game now its not enough that theyre at a number disadvantage so theyre forced to take the most logical course of action to retreat when faced with a fleet of gankers specifically out to hunt them down and spamming the scan button every single second is so much better than scouting the area and click warp to 0 once right3 only u cant scan down a covert ops ship thats scanning u down and neither can u scan down a force recon that can also be used to tackle u instead til the blob comes along hell even a stealth bomber fitted just to tank and tackle would work theyll be on grid alright u just wont know about it til ure tackled4 i never once suggested to make ratting easier because the current local is fine as is and sovereign defenders can still see the pilots in local to boot
only supported if i get a new automated way to tell if people enter a system and who they are chatless and minor delay is okay with me 510seconds for my sensors to detect a ship and identify the pilotwhy well i have this spaceship see and it has these scanners it should have an automated way to tell if there are other spaceships around without me spamming my system scanner the whole time even if my detection system only works in the system scanners max range i could live with that if there is still a local chat then typing anything in it automatically makes you show up on my detection system regardless of being in range or not any use of chat corp private convo would tell my detection system that another ship was in system but wouldnt tell me the pilots name as they are on secure comms until they entered the scanners range
i think this is a very good idea so it might make lowsec and 00space a bit more challengeing for everyone and black ops would become a bigger part in fleet operations on the other hand side gameplay would become a little more realistic be honest a allround intel tool like the local channel is not very realistic gathering intel in real life is quite a bit of work and so it should be made like its proposedsupported
you get an interesting definition of realistic one where an alliance controlling quite some solar systems many planets and countless moons where artificial wormholes all kind of cool weapon and defense systems are available cant put an automated cloaked drone on a gate to keep track who comes in only when they cover cyno in it should then be a bit more complicatedso all in all what you are saying is you think that local should also show ship types
its your issue that your playing solo in an mmo and if you are in 00 its vary rare that you are not in an alliance if you arent in an alliance then you get whats coming to you if you are in an alliance then you will be the warning for the others to safe up or fleet up this is your space there shouldnt be any bubbles in your alliances space if you run into one and die then you are the warning for the alliance if you dont then you have nothing to worry about as this space is your space it shouldnt be that hard to get some help to deal with a cov ops frig and if your fitting a pvp fit to start with a stealth bomber isnt going to kill you before help shows upbolded the important part there is your issue you cant solo rat being in an alliancecorp is about more then you and any teamwork be it ratting mining fleet combat is a good thing and should be encouragedthis is an mmo if you want to play solo stay in highsec that simple if your alliance cant deal with kicking a few roaming gangs out of there space thats there issue you have the same advantages killing them that delayed local provides for themno but you can see scan probes on the dscanner and very few pilots are good at finding you in short order without keeping the probes out and again sure you will die but you will be the warning for your alliance its not like you dont have insurance for that raven of yours or what have you ship you rat in whats that you fly t2 to rat maybe thats not the best idea since you cant insure itthe current system is to easy to get away with it someone in intel channel screams 30 jumps away that reds are heading your way you keep ratting 10 jumps away its still safe you keep ratting 5 jumps you align to a warp out but keep ratting 1 jumps still going reds in system you warp and cloak or safe up as long as you can see your enemys in local and are paying attention to local no ratter will ever be caught provided they watch local and intel channels stay aligned and warped out at the first sign of redjust because you play your mmo solo doesnt mean thats they way it should be if you solo in 00 and get caught with your pants down you deserve whats coming to you
lol this redicules topic makes me laugh wts competent dictor pilot and scouts serious what should happen is that all high sec local should be on the delayed mode 00 with delayed mode is going to be a roaming heaven in the time the scout warns for an incomming gang and types it in intell channels the station is already bubbled theres plenty of people to kill if u search them in the right systems on the right places with the right ships not supported
still on the fencewith no alternatives the absence of local tips the balance of power greatly towards the gankers favor especially the cloaky ones also having to constantly press the directional scanner is annoying and tedious when youre on the defensive ratter minerso ill support this if cloakers cannot use their directional scanner while cloaked cloakers cannot recloak for 30 seconds  1 minute covert or otherwise directional scanner is automated to ping every 510 seconds with a useful display at the corner of the map kinda like the xwing vs tie fighter displays
all against i can see are of some random carebears that are afraid of being ganked and want to be 100 safethe main reason to do it is to make 00 alliance wars and pvp more interesting  which is one of the main reasons to go to 00 in the first place  not to be a carebear 
noits your issue with me that im soloing in an mmo point out where in mmo it says its a requirement to fleet up with others at all times to even play cause i dont recall being put in a fleet the instant i log on no ones a oneman army that can do anything to a blob so idk what ure so upset about when it comes to soloing 1 do u see an alliance tag on my char2 when did i mention anything about claiming my own space2 read againstealth bomber thats fitted to tackle and tank never said anything about dps3 i never said i had help to begin with did icant solo rat who r u to tell someone else how to play u just want to eliminate soloing altogether by removing local thats not encouraging fleetingits an ultimatum to either fleet and outblob your enemy or quit u just cant deal with the fact that soloers wont be sitting ducks and let u ez your way up the killboards at their expenseagain with u dictating how other ppl should play ill say it once and ill say it againtheres no alliance im inonly if theyre 14 au or closer they dont have to bring the probes in to zero in on your exact location if ure present in the system theyll just send the stealth bomberforce recon forward and once they find u ure as good as dead again with alliance im in a corp a pretty dead one too not an allianceto be continued
u say the system seems easy for us because u only want to deal with mindless players that r as dumb as rats and this is just like what i said before when u come across someone with an actual brain u want to catch us with our pants down by removing the only tool we have to defend ourselves with simply because we wont let u catch us cry me a riverjust because u play your mmo one way doesnt mean other ppl should play the way u want them to whether its stop soloing or just letting your fleet get free killmails at their expense r u paying for my subscription or anyone else ure hunting for no u want easy kills make use of your own subscription make a throwaway alt to farm kills with your main on
except that the intel channels are now severely nerfed due to lack of local and the hostiles are only seen are if they accidently bumped into them at the gate or got ganked by them how do you know if that onyx is friendly sure ask in the intel chat and now you have a bunch of people cluttering up intel with whos that onyx on scan whos that drake by the time thats sorted the gankers got the raven the next system over also it should not be necessary for someone to be a victim before the intel can be given that just screams that you just want easy targetspeople put bubbles up in their own space since its one of the few means of catching cloaky ships most people arent worried about the covert ops but they dont like that theres someone in the system now giving intel and theres not a damn thing they can do about it also covert cloaky ships like the proteustengu are extremely deadly in packs sounds like you dont make your main income ratting otherwise youd know that your iskhour drops like a stone the second someones ratting with you to the point that you may as well just mission in empire most people in 00 want to limit their pve ratting time as much as possible so they can go out and pew pewits an mmo yes its also a sandbox so if someone wants to fly solo so be it local is a tool that gives both sides an equal advantage the directional scanner does not give an equal advantage it favors the gankerwhy does someone dying have to be flag that lets people know theres hostiles in system rattersminers shouldnt be free targets for the roaming gang if they wanna rat with a t2 ship let them if they dont warp outor get prepared to fight fast enough when they see reds on local then sux to be them when they get caughtalso who uses probes to find people in belts whats to stop people from using their onboard scanner to find people in anomolies or just warping cloaked to a belt even covopssbs make decent tacklers when tanked if they safe up probe them out if theyre cloaked then they should be rewarded by keeping their ship for following the rules of survival in 00 once you remove local how exactly does one protect themselves no one wants to be the first victim to alert the intel channelok based on your post you want people to always stay grouped up and earn pathetic iskhour intel channels to be chaotic full of people trying to sort out whos on their scanner and people posting that they just got ganked unless they happened to see the group jump the gate and i dont know about you but youd be hard pressed to find someone to sacrifice accounts to be gate watchers easy ganks for the cloaky roaming ganggive the people a tool that can give the prey a chance to survive before removing local the directional scanner and probes already give attackers good tools to use otherwise people will just make their isk in empire and the situation goes back to what it used to be and people only go out to 00 to pvp
im sorry but your op was just too much rephrased it sounds likedurr i dont know why its there but i assume if we had less lag it would end the lag and if we end lag the lag will be gone
failpost again you know  some ppl got it proof for your low capabilities im not going to draw you a scheme thanx for the bump anyway  pls come back with an argument mkay 
what a charming opin this thread a proposal made by a person that doesnt quite understand how clientserver interactions work or what is causing the lag they are talking about and that wants to have irrelevant changes made to try and counter issues that are completely unrelatededit removed the rude bit that was meant for a different thread where the ops being a donkey
you being polite i will answer polite its true that only having complete source code and also by testing one can asses the impact that those changes would have however you dont need the source code to know that those features im takling about do put aditional stress on the node question to the comunity is actually how much do they really count towards gameplay and if getting rid of them in situations where they would help lag is acceptable nothing more nothing less a dev might indeed shed light if it would have if any and how much impact on the performance you should understand this discution as a brainstorming or forcus group or whatever you want to contribute to it please explain why you think those have nothing to do with lag or why you think effects are vital in high lag conditions saying that i dont understand clientserver means that you doand in that case please let us know how it works 
theres two types of lag server lag and client lag your talking as if they were the same other then that your suggestion boils down to optimizing serverclient interaction which if it could be done im sure it would be a suggestion this vague is a lot like suggesting we end world hunger by feeding the hungry the problem is no one but ccp could possibly know the details of their source code theyre not likely to release such things for our armchair quarterbacking
againmissions after and only after you clear a room of all enemies you become able to bookmark that space to come back later without running all preceeding gates scanning and gating mechanics remain otherwise unchanged alternatively allow micro warp drivesgraphics add 2d graphics like sparks shells shield armor and hull impacts these would be client side and toggleableinappropriate comments removedsteviesgwhat a miserable attempt at a flame well not that id expect differentlydont you have a family or a wifedont you have friends that come visit youdont you have a jobim not surprised that of all the possible reasons you chose the most idioticand againand stop whining like a child about the fact that i dont tolerate stupidity and imbecility you know that at least the graphical proposal is worth of approval and if you people had the courage youd approve it even despite the fact that you dont like the original poster
greetings everybodyi think the actual content is something worthy of addressing generic as it may be though therefore i think its a shame to see it burst into flameslet me introduce a few concepts agm or active game mechanic something that requires active input from a player and can also be defined by the sheer absence of it ie a forced wait and pgm or passive game mechanic the opposite of active and third bad game designwhat do i mean by bad game designi am aggregating what is said here mission running is a very profitable profession which needs to be balanced out that is probably what it is just speculation and irrelevant can you mission your way to whatever is perceived as a top answer that for yourself lets just assume that was fact for now howeverhere specifically achieving the balance concept by not enabling mission runners too much virtual currency can be done with pgm  lower mission rewards or agm  make people wait at gates every time they fill up their cargo to come to reloot or come back with a tractorsalvage destroyer no mwd to make the ordeal slower and lower the income ratethe important stuff only begins hereachieving the same goal with agm takes away from players fun because as in this case specifically they spend time doing nothing the gate wait reactivation of the whole series remember gametime is extremely precious it is only that some types of players find it easier to accept that as unique quality of the game or even part of the game experience would you say that the hardcore players with less rl obligations find that lessirritating than people whose life is on a 4hour timer dictated by say baby feeding requirementshowever in both cases it is disrespectful does not value the to players gametime value and therefore bad game designin the end a word to the op it looks to me like hes trying to make a game fit the kind of gamers it doesnt his rl friends and to rub it all in the current population is happy it doesnt fit and in the very endif eve was a game which completely catered to the casual gamer people with lots of rl obligations who cant afford to spend 3 consecutive hours ingame it wouldnt be the eve that it is today that is the game experience would probably be slightly different although it is every mmorpg developers wetdream to have it so forked out that theres something for everyone in it imagine how many subscribers that can attract missions in eve are probably the major mechanic that caters to casuals who dont want to get involved with the social things and just want to do something and do it aloneit is however weak and lame to use the game experience clichUFFFD as only that a justification and an excuse not to admit and fix improve instances of bad game design regardless with good design experience can be not only preserved but even enhancedthank you for your attention have a good onecheers
i sincerely thank you for your thoughts but i honestly dont understand where you stand in respect to the modifications needed to avoid using your terms the bad game design behind current acceleration gate mechanicsi hope we all agree that any game can become the perfect game as long as theres space to develop things for some players that dont break the other players game soquite frankly allowing bookmarks thus reducing or better balancing isk rewards or using any other appropriate counterbalance when actually needed or alternatives like mwds is not game breaking at all and obviously and clearly rather opens different ways of playing for example that pvp window i mentioned earliernot to talk about the graphical additions 2d is cheap and can add immense quality to any battleedittypoz
maybe you should play a game that has a pause button if you are interrupted that much ofcourse the other option is to get a ship that can permatank the missions so you can go afk for 5h if needed wihtout having the ship go boom
yeah yeah what everdont kill your cat just because the world hates you
apologies if i was uncleari count some of the things going on in this topic forcing players to reactivate all gates every warpoutin as bad game design and dont accept any excuse for that therefore i support the change to get rid of that because it is nothing but tediousness the issues raised about what kind of securityrisk that poses well that can be solved a different way pgm over agm againthe claims as to how that would unbalance things are too vague and used nothing but weasel arguments the missions are the only mechanic that keeps a certain kind of players interested making it possible for that type to become semiprosperous is well intendedthinking about it more can get us to this assbackward reasoning if missions are attractive instead of introducing tediousness to them to curb the profits they can generate the real solution would be making other types of activities more alluring  profitableentice players to diversify not punish them for picking the thing made most enticing in the 1st place and by designthank you for your attention
i would just like to mention again that gates are the only thing that keeps you alive if you mission in lowsec
 and whats the deal dont you realize that nothing changes in favor of those misterious enemies that youre so afraid of if anything its all the contrary you the victim of the ambush ninja loot earn a tool to quickly refit and get back into your deadspace pocket to face your looters if you so desire
so would they oh but you forgot thatmost ninjagankin peeps run in packs your ignorance is hilariousthe whole point of them showing up is they want you to shoot them
i feel the game needs this and im also up for medium and large tractors
sounds awesome
suportedwhat i would like to see1 add a tractor ii2 take small from name  just tractor i tractor ii and capital3 make it so a tractor beam cannot be outflown  does it really make sense that something that is pulling something towards you certain rate can have the beam stretched by going faster then 500ms surely the 500ms should be constant no matter ship speednote  saying using an orca or marauder class is stupid due to the high sp investment plus those ships apply a bonus that means that fitting the proposed tractor ii to them would then apply the bonus so if ii has a range of 25km they become 50km
supported tractorbeams are way underdevelopedthat would make no sense if you are heading towards the object that you are tractoring at more than 500ms the tractor beam would actually push the object further away from you in relation to its starting point
this would likely cause some serious drop in salvage prices since youd then be able to fit 7x salvagers and a tractor on a cane salvager op supported id prefer longer range heavily to faster speed but wither would be nice it would have to require science v or adding a new tractor beam skill though so im not sure if i would ever use them unless i go back to missioning
tractor beam is not a stick its a gravitationalmagnetic other type of field that applies force to an object it will always pull it towards you
thats why it makes no sense
i just would like to bring it to the front again
im not here to argue so ill just tick the box and get on with my life
unfortunately i do not belong to the elite that has endless timeinsert smart argument heresupported
i just experienced this little annoyance myself good idea there have been some smart arguments made against it too perhaps it should be limited to just one skill at at time meaning can only inject one pending skill that a prereq is currently being trained suported
supportin dis yobrofist
the skillqueue does not need a buff be happy the queue is there and stop trying to make eve into a themeparkway to take things out of contextnot supported
edit to support my own idea  ok if i was not in a good mood i might say something bad but since i am in a great mood i will not stoop to troll levelinstead i bring you all an improvementin the beginning there was no queue and all the eve peeps were sadthen came the queuethe queue was a great idea no more getting up at 3 am to swap out skills yeai can set the queue up to train a skill i ii iii and sometimes iv automaticly wonderful problem of getting up at 3 am solvednow time for me to get interceptors buy the book checktrain the em prereq to v ok on itlast skill is going to be done at 3 am not a problem night before ill line up interceptor i and ii thatll carry til i get up and ill set iii before workummmthats where i run into the problemuntil em is complete i cant add int to the queue at 3 amand i am back to the problem of getting up at 3 am so if the orig programmaticly simplesolution is problematical because people could inject lots of skills this is bad why never mind ill take your word for itthen perhaps a refinement is in orderif you are in a station and have a book in storage you can add to the queue inject on completion make a pretty graphic for the queue followed by i ii and iii 24 hr space permittingthen when em is done the queue sees and autoinjects the interceptor skill and trains it i ii iii when i am up i add iv all is goodif the queue gets to the inject step and horrors you movedfoldedspindledmutilated the book no problem the queue simply discards the action and dependant actions no messpossibly sends you an email to whine at you for the actionbetter
and another one offers no reason what does a themepark have to do with thisactually we were talking about the queue the whole time so context was not an issue what is the issue is that anyone who opposes this never ever offers a good reason to not support it and instead talks about going back to how things were before such as
you do realize if everyone is of your hyperconservative mindset and be happy of what is there then thered be no skill queues no updates no patches no developers no assembly hall forum no features and ideas forum no innovation and ccp wouldve probably gone bankrupt a long time ago gtfo
i totally agree with this comment just because its better than it used to be doesnt mean it cant become more better this person must simply believe options are evil if people have options then they might make choices and be happyunhappy with their choices if someone makes a different choice and is happy with it then i might have made a wrong choice if i made a wrong choice the maybe i cant blame my unhappiness on someone else its much easier just to assume everyone else is wrong because they disagree with me regardless of whether the decisions actually involve mealternatively heshe may just lack the ability to communicate that its simply not a priority for them and dev time could better be spent elsewhere op i support this product andor service it seems like a relatively minor code change and anything that makes the skill training system less hassle to work with is a good thing imo its not exceptionally high on my list of features i want but it wouldnt be bad
my experience continues after logging in to mine and ask some questions about mining becouse i actually i did mine just a litte bit in my eve lifei have encounter that there is some players that have so much money they just go to high security and attack miners just waiting for them to blow up even if concord attack themi cant open for some reason the links you put in your post it says error somethingi want pve action please specially if it shouws 10 bs agains me it was fun until i got blow up i feel forced to pvp i feel like i need to learn some skills that dosnt give me no money at all i find it a waste of time the pvp becouse you attack and loose your ship or they loose theyrs i think that is why the miner got the best deal becouse that way they just provide the material for them to blow up each other hehehesorry for my broken english
youve experienced what is known as hulkageddon or suicide ganking which is rampantfor some damn reason they think the cause of inflation laughs is due to high mineral prices never mind the main issue isare prices are crashing these days ie tritthe solution to mining is you dont mine in and around main hubs go find a system 5 to 10 jumps out some quiet dead end system where mission runners are few and between and gankers cant be arsed into coming out to find you unless you really upset theman alternative is to move to whs or 00 where the odds are balanced out and you have an alliance or good sized corp to back you upwhich is where i mine now 
can someone repost this on somewhere like pastebin in a format that wont make my head explode when i try to read it from the bits i could get read out of it1 op got stolen from2 op shot at the person that stole from him3 person shot back killed ops 1bil ship4 op decided there was something wrong with this and that person shouldnt have been allowed to shoot back5 op came to walloftextattack the assembly hall forums with what im guessing is a proposal to have it that if someone gets shot at after they steal from you concord comes to tackle and perjamneut them for you so you can pick away at them at your leisuredoes this sum it upedit wow ops original post completely broke me for a moment there
i would like to see the ability to queue up skills on any character on any account regardless if another character on the same account is currently trainingi am not suggesting that all characters could train simultaneously however i would like to see characters switch training to another character when the skill queue empties
an account skill queue would be extremely convenient
thissupported
that would makes things much more better
supported
as long as they keep to the 24 hour setup and nonsimultaneous training time heck ya
give them an inch and they take a milethis feature would be so under used it is not worth the programming there is a fast amount of stuff that is a lot more important than this i would prefer they focus on those things instead of thisnot supported
if youve visited the help channel any time recently whether seeking help or wanting to provide ityoull see that its virtually unreadable a frustrating nonhelping experience for everyone i propose that the help chats be divided into a startercorp specific help channel that is public so that regular players who want to help can joinfor example state war acadamy help channel
not supported there exists an official help channel where everyone is free to join to help or ask questions making different help channels will only reduce the number of people in each channel that can help also if you intention is to make an extra channel for each npc starter corporation that is for help only you reduce the people willing to help even more as each race has 3 iirc starter corporations they might be placed in meaning 12 new help channels if you are calling the npc corp chats help and want them to become open to other players i think the purpose is to keep people from messing with them on a large scale ie recruiting or attempting to scam them because they are in a npc corp if you have issues with the help channel there are several other player run channels you can seek help but most likely if you simply ask your question again wait to see if someone answers you if not ask again you will be answered it is very rare that the official help channel is overrun with chitchat or arguments that make helping people impossible since it is gm and isd monitored
have you been in the help channel recently its as bad as jita local during prime time describing the giving or receiving of help there now as difficult would be charitable no it would increase the amount of help because those seeking help could actually have their questions seen by the people willing to give it i never suggested that the npc corp channel be the help channel i suggested that the global help channel be broken down and linked to the starter corps the channel would be public and seperate from the standard corp channel and how many week old noobs have any idea where to look for other player run channelsyouve clearly not been in the help channel any time recently
problem a isk spammer petitions take too long to be processed and isk spammers are getting free reignsolution a add a right click isk spammer report buttonoutcome a spammer petitions are easierproblem b complaints from customers about the prevalence of isk spammers are chewing gm resources and generating negative feedbacksolution b add a right click isk spammer report buttonoutcome b complaints are much reduced as subscribers no longer notice just how many isk spammers go on spamming without being gaggedbannedproblem c isk spammers are bad for evesolution c add a right click isk spammer report buttonoutcome c not really much change as we dont have any kind of autogag system and still have to look at everything manually1 the isk spammer button does nothing except hide the problem2 isk spammers are now spamming for longer then they were under the old system3 the problem is hidden complaints reduced and percieved necessity for action by ccp reducedthe feature is a failure it works for usability but ccp actually has to act on the reports for them to be of any value at alla auto temp x min local gag after y reports from different alliancecorp would be beneficialthis should only be a gag on local channel to avoid it being used to silence fcs in combatif the goal of this feature was to hide the problem to reduce the complaints level then it was a successif the goal was to make isk spamming harder then its failed
get out of jita then
it hasnt failed at all
not a failure as previously to get a gms attention you had to file a petition wasting your time and a petition slot as you can only have a limited number of active petitions and there are always many isk spammers the old way you blocked them and moved on ccp rarely knew about them until someone wasted a petition on one of them except when they did it in a moderated channel then they get kicked or muted to all also you got to have a huge list of crappy player characters occupying your block list making unblocking real players or just managing real blocked players a real painthe new way ccp can bandeal with these accounts and they are not generating more crap on the players side in blocks or petitions and ccp doesnt have to deal with isk spammer petitions for spammers that may have switched accounts already
if im not mistaken the current report function removes what someone has said from local for everyone not only the person that reported them correctif so then how would enacting a temporary localonly mute be any different from what is already being donecurrent solution removes any text from reported player from local and denies them the ability to post anything new in local until the report is reviewedproposed solution removes any text from reported player from local and denies them the ability to post anything new in local until the report is reviewedi see absolutely no difference
there is a reason i offically refer to the op as dr whinesmithbecause thats all he does anymore seriously search his postsand on the subject at hand not supporting this whine threadseriously guy sounds like its time for you to take a vacation from eve
no it doesnt it removes the text only for youoh how very creative go ahead search my threads just ignore the good onesas the replies here indicate the feature has worked as intended by hiding the problemwith the old petition system gms were quicker to move as if they didnt complaints grewunder the new system isk spammer reports are taking longer to process as the pressure to gag them has been removedsimply pointing out that the new system results in isk spammers being able to spam for longer without interruptionit might not appear that way but its simply the reality of the features impacti dont care massively just thought it was worth bringing to peoples attention as you can see most wrongly believe the feature is actually working

a corp mate contacted me to inform me that his account got banned temporarily due to a hacker having gained access to his account upon my notification i not only immediatly removed all access to that character but i also ended up booting the character out of the corp as a full day after i removed his rights and access he still managed to access my corp wallet and the pos funds i had set up and drained them all the day after i removed his rights i also suspect that he was in the precess of snatching the corp loot as div 1 corp hanger is completly drained of modules i recently discovered the missing loot todayafter i saw that the corp wallet was drained after i had removed his rights and access i became as bout as mad as a swarm of killer hornets total loss to the corp was 300 million isk after the true owner of that account was able to prove t me he was the original owner i was told that all his property and the corps isk went to a player named umami who is in a corp ran by 6 players i fully suspect these people in that corp to be behind this rl criminal activity and would like them investigated and prosecutedwhat is being done to put a stop to this rl criminal activity with regaurds to the game and how can i get reimburst for my corps loss due to a non game related criminal act the petition has no category for this kind of activitythanks for your time and help
tell your stupid corp mates not to click on phishing links and not to buy isk
1 stop making durrogatory accusations to something you know nothing about2 put an end to your insultsif you cant follow the above then kindly stfu and move on i have zero interest in bull  hacking is very serious and should be treated as such it could just as easily be your accounts financial informationsince there is no option available in the petitions tab that handles this kind of activity i am asking the counsel i want to know is1 what is being done to safe guard against this rl criminal activity2 since this activity included in game items it can also just as easily deal with actual fiancial accounts how is ccp protecting them from hacking3 had my corps property been taken theough legit ingame actions i wouldnt care yeah i would be mad as hell but thats the game since this activity involved a rl out of game criminal activity called hacking how can i get my stuff reimburst 4 is ccp permabanning the characters that recieved my corps property which was immedately sold after they took the itemsplease note that the items in question went missing a full day after i revoked all rights by not banning those characters the in my eyes hacking is an acceptable means to get ahead in the game i would be more than happy to talk about this through the petition channel but again there is no category involving rl criminal activity which is why i am discussing it here
i got many questions are you sure it was he who took them could it have been another corpmate who actually had the rights at that time did your corpmate file a petition to ccp are you sure your corpmate really got hacked and wasnt using this as an excuse to steal corp assets how did the hacker gain access to the account to actually steal stuff if the account was bannedhow did the true owner of the account log in if the account was banned
as james tritanius questions show your tale dont sum up1 if you had removed all roles how was possible for the character to access the corp wallet2 if it was really done by that account and you correctly removed the roles start a petition under rules  policies  exploit as accessing a corp wallet without roles is clearly an exploit3 for account stealing use the rules  policies  eula violations section of the petitions as accessing an account that is not yours is a eula violation4 ccp can patrol the forum and the game but the security of a player pc is primarily a responsibility of the player if my computer get infected by a keylogger because i have an outdated antivirus or click on every link i see it is my problem idem if i give away my username and password to a few friends and someone use it to rob me and my corpmates ccp can try to reduce the consequences of my error but they cant stop me from doing stupid things that put me at risk
tell us more about how the csm should be responsible for reallife law enforcement
i see no proposal opreallife hacking is not ccps responsibility to stop if someone means to get onto your pc intercept your data or crack your usernamepassword for anything chances are good they are going to succeed if the user has not taken the required steps to prevent such a thing from happeningas for what happened  there are tools and functions in place in game to check and make sure of exactly who has been taking things from your corp  audit log containers  wallet journalstransaction histories  simplynotgivingeveryoneaccesstohangarsallwillynillylikei doubt that this removed player was responsible for taking things from your hangar because well if he was banned temporarily then during his ban he could not have possibly logged on to take anything from your corp at all after his unbanning he will not have been able to see let alone access any corp hangars to take things and will not have been able to make any corp wallet transactions at allso i guess what im trying to say is  pics or it didnt happenalso nothing to support in the op
take your own advice kiddo this is not the place to talk about thisobviously your the victim of corp theft a clever one at that liekly more than onei had a member who had an account hacked i managed to trace what he did wrongused the same username as his micro account msnmsg being that it was windows he likely get hit with a keylogger or some suchthis game is famous for metagaming i suggest you take a step back and do a little researchyour going to find out that 9 times out of 10 ccp cant do a damn thing but investigate and research to find out who lost whatso yeah very weak case here not going to win points
if you check the minutes from csm4 meeting 3 you will see ive been tasked with submitting an amended proposal for account securitythe idea isnt to stop metagaming etc but to hopefully make it harder for people to transfer your characters should they hack your accountusual rules apply  dont give out your username and password if asked dont download random applications dont visit dodgy websites with insecure browsers or at all 
right now system of bookmarks is the total attrocity you have to physically move those vouchers it takes ages to load a can with bookmarks its incredibly bulky its very difficult to organize them every now and then folders dissapear and all those tons of bookmarks get thrown into root folder there are more and more people living in wormholes including myself bookmarks is bread and butter for us one of the key problems which i see with current system is that its very difficult to dissemenate bookmarks among corp members if 1 member of corporation scanned down a chain of wormholes then its a very tedious task to move those bookmarks to other corp members please do something about it
if eve is to get more players system needs to be better
there are plenty of threads about bookmarks already and in fact the issue has been brought to the csmwe are working on it please use the existing thread to add comments
bubble spam looks ridiculous why not have them combine together when they are within the vicinity of each other or overlapping
what
not approvedthat would only make it easier to sling bubble a gate to cover all avenues of approach not even sure if its an intended mechanic since it doesnt display on its info
i think he means the visuals i think he wants it so when bubbles overlap it doesnt look like two bubbles crossed with each other but two connected bubbles
waste of timemerging or nonmerging will not alleviate the problem nor make it easierthe actual issue is not the number of bubbles or how messy it looks but the overlapping animations that overwhelm systems with very nasty fps rates
hell yeah pew pew and stuff
interesting concept id say its more along the lines of being a problem if too many people are not hostile to each other for some time there have been around 6 massive power blocks in nullsec controlling the vast majority of space so efficiently that relatively few new groups ever manage to move into nullsec without becoming a member of a nearby nap powerblockif everyone in eve somehow managed to just get along then wed have nothing but essentially empire space and itd be just as boring running your 5000th worlds collide in npc 00 as it was in motsuim not sure if this is the way to stop the alliance blobbing nothing will stop fleet blobbing but alliance blobbing is reducing the ability for new groups to get starterd in the more dangerous areas because theyre so much more dangerous for those new people than the already napd giants
1 eris needed in more love 
would that be right up there with them wanting mining to not be an automated task aka macromining
i dont see the problem with having salvaging drones you have to target the wreck and sick them on it or several and send each on a wreck letting them loose to salvage everything in your control range is silly mining drones dont work like that why should salvaging drones
if it simply jetted it into a container then thered be no need for the drone to use its own cargobay no since thatd literally be the same to the server as creating a jetcan when you salvage a wreck for the loot to go into if theres anything left in the wreck thus creating a new container as far as im aware anywayas for the child in the backseat behaviour this would only occur if the drone had to be an entity with its own cargohold since the cargohold is essentially what the drone needs to exist as an entity for  no box of popcorn for the kid and it just goes to sleep out of boredomif the drone had to be bringing the salvage back to the ship thatd still require the loadunload ai routines and ai shutdown routine before scooping as it is the ai would need to loadshut down when launchingscooping the drones anyway but all drones do that already with mining drones and fighters being the only ones with extra levels of complexity to their aii still see this as a fluffaddition rather than a needed feature  there are so many otherbetter things that would be more valuable to have added to the game that could end up using the same server resources required for this and the same programming timeeffort required for this
despite how problematic it might be to implementi would be very nice to have

ok these new experimental storyline missions are very badly designed for all sorts of reasonsa force you to go many jumps into low sec yep pve ship through pvp pirate spaceb are fw warfare linked so take you to systems with fw pilots waiting for you as well as the piratesc take people to the same few systems because of the fw storyline link so those gates are player pirate camped as they wait for the missions runners to appear to give easy targetsd are way above the agent level you are running for eg the level 2 storylines are harder than level 4 missionse give a crappy reward of an implant that is worth about 100k iskthese experimental missions were introduced as a surprise in dominion with it appears little thought or understanding of the mission runner player base by the eve storyline board in atlanta with no testing on singularity in the dev blog words they were really excited about these missions which shows what idiots some of the ccp developers and pve content writers have become and how little they understand or care about the pve player basebtw these storylines are going to all players so you find that you have run 16 mining or courier missions to be rewarded with one of these uber pvp combat missions as a storyline to get faction standing so think about that  you are a pve industrialistminer noncombat pilot and you get given one of these storylines and may be given another after another 16 missions so noncombat pilots grinding faction are being given these uber forced fw and pvp many jumps into lo sec missionsmy proposal has three parts1 remove these experimental storyline missions they were an untested very bad idea or at least give people the choice of one of these or an ordinary storyline mission give us the paying customer the choice of being a lab rat or not2 investigate why ccp thought it was such a good idea to put this rushed content through as an add on to dominion why was the impact on pve players not properly thought through and the csm should raise questions about the competence of those ccp developers tasked with pve content if this is the best they can come up with the paucity of the design of this game content raises serious questions about all involved and ccps commitment to the pve player3 ccp should properly test all content and especially pve content beforehand csm zastrow has written in another thread about how ccp seem reluctant to use the csm as a focus group to concept test content at its very early stages thanks to the interwebs this form of idea testing is not difficult use internet meeting tools and survey tools  many of these are free then once implemented experimental stuff should not just be forced down peoples throats we should have a choice whether to take part in this experiment hence the offer two storyline missions idea at the moment gallente missions runners especially those grinding for faction feel like victims of poor game designi am all for more content and experimentation with customer feedback but the way that this has been done smacks of rank amateurism by people with no understanding of the pve playerbase
this thread is not the correct place to post proposals you can post a link to the proposal in the assembly forum which i see you already have and well look at ithowever what you posted above is different to what you proposed please either edit the original thread or confirm the linked proposal is what you want the csm to look at it helps us if all the discussion is in one place
i have updated by proposal in the assembly hall the first post in that thread if you could go with that please thank you
allowing ships to be renamed if in your hanger even if not active  yes this makes sense and would make logistics a bit nicerrepacking modules automatically when trying to sell or stack  is this really a big problem select all items right click repackage i suppose a popup if you try to sell an assembled item could be addedin either case this needs to be raised as a proposal in the assembly forum this forum can be used for discussing potential proposals but the csm cannot and will not take ideas from here to the meetings
thumbs up
yep 4th bonus pls
you are either and idiot or a troll or bothdrone ships can no only apply theirs bonus across all damage types they also can apply them to light medium heavy and sentry droneswould you support a change to drone ships that means their bonus only applies to their racial drones this would mean dominix only gets a bonus to gallente droneswould you also support a change that means drone ships have a limit to the size of drone that is bonused frigs only bonus light drones cruisers only bonus medium drones and battleships only bonus heavy and sentry dronesseems balanced right braniac
if you want to jump into the way back machine when drones were originally overhauled 15 deployed max to 5 the dominixvexorect all had their drone bonus changed to thermal drones only it never made tq because of screaming protesting
drake is already a good ship some may say its already overpowered
i was on a trip so sorry for the late replyraw dps alone is mostly meaningless and a poor excuse because all turret based guns have tracking and only one and much shorter optimal while missle have their complete long range as optimal sure a pulse harbi can outdps a drake but it has a fraction of the range still has issues like tracking and cap usage and no choice of damage type when switching to long range t1 ammo a drake outdpses the pulse harbi at 3 times the range with t2 long range ammo the harbi has barely higher dps but still a third of the range this is outside drone range so not counting at close range the picture reverses but what did you expect with beams the comparison becomes even more patheticfinally you can easily fit multiple damage mods on the shield tankers without sacrificing tank unlike the armor tankersactually your assessment is incomplete and biased you are cherry picking the aspects that favor your proposali dont see why it does blow my argument out the water mini has the choice of damage type and blanket bonus but still has downsides like the turret issues and split weapon systems like the other races mini also cant match both range and dps of caldari an arti cane matches the drakes dps with t2 lr ammo but with 23rd of the range for the turrets and thats not using the kinetic bonus for the drake with t1 lr ammo and still not using the kinetic bonus the drake outdpses the cane at almost double the range the problem with missls is you cant trade range for dps by switching ammo but that is a different subject and imo that is already well balanced out by other factors
let me ask you this aineko macxdo you consider a rofdpl bonus to be better than a 5 kin only bonus 
i do and im pretty sure he does as welledit hell who am i kidding everyone thinks a rofdpl bonus is better than a 5 kin only bonus or we wouldnt have this debate and you wouldnt have suggested the change in the first place whats your point
so conversly is it also fair to say that you thinka 5 kin only bonuses is worse than a 5 rofdpl bonus 
yesi know where you are going with this and i will say that your conclusion is flawed
since youve stated that this thread isnt about ship balance issues are we to assume that you think that a 5 rofdpl bonus is not superior to the kinetic bonus in which case why are you proposing this idea since it wouldnt benefit the ships in questionif on the other hand you do feel that the 5 rofdamage bonus is superior to kinetic bonus please explain your comments to the contrary demonstrate that the ships affected require boosting and that this is the appropriate boost to apply you should discuss identify current weaknesses compare and contrast alternative changes produce comparisons between the affected ships and their racial counterparts you have three hours
you really dont  as actually i want your supportyou have basically agreed with the op that kin bonuses are poor compared to 5 rof bonuseswhat would you suggest as a fix caldari missile boat pilots should enjoy just as much benefit from there training as other races pilots
thats where the flaw comes in as gypsio said above the fact that rof and omni damage bonuses are more powerful than kinonly damage bonuses means that it will buff the affected ships if the change is made you cant just say the racial bonuses of one race is inferior than another and therefore it must be changed you have to identify the shortcomings on a ship to ship basis or it will imbalance the game as an example would you say repair amount and repair efficiency bonuses are worse than resistance bonuses if so do you support changing gallente and minmatar ships to 5 resistancelevel
ah so this is not about balancing ships its about making the numerical benefit of skilling up equal for all races just for the sake of equalizing it your argument has been the kinetic only bonus is worse than a blanket bonus which is correct but is no proof that something is imbalanced and needs to be fixedyou understand that by asking for the bonus to be buffed something else will have to be nerfed to keep the balance so what would you give up for this change and why would it be better as in more balanced than the current situation
i didnt say the bonus is inferior  you didi asked you what you would suggest to fix it you havnt answered my questionor are you of the opinion that caldari mb pilots should suffer poor bonuses for the sake of game balance which btw doesnt exist  even gypsio is of the opinion that many although not all cmbs are in need of helpalthough he favours individual fixes per ship which do nothing to correct the imbalance of bonuseson your last point id have to say 1 fix at a time pleasei have my hands full with this one atmif you wanna start a thread i will give it my considered opinionif i have select 5 kin to pursue its because of all the bonuses its definettely the worstfixing it would in my opinion  give us 4 pvp capable races to play  instead of only 35
of course its proof of something its proof that caldari mb hull training is less benificial than traing on other ship hullssomething would only have to be nerfed if something became opyou assume balance where there is noneit is impossible for a ship to be balanced if it recieves far smaller bonuses than its peersit is possible for it to be balanced at any partivcular player level  but it cant be balanced at all player levelsmost evidence in game seems to point to the fact that cmbs perform poorly in pvp compared to there peerscovered in many previous post  please read up and dont ask me to reiterate it all
so youre saying that the kinetic only bonus is the reason caldari are only half capable at pvp that statement reveals quite a lack of knowledge even just saying caldari suck at pvp is highly debatable im all for balancing ships if they are shown to be underperforming or overpowered compared to their counterparts you havent done that if you want to start looking at general balancing stuff why dont we start by addressing the lack of a skill reducing signature resolution for turrets missls got guided missile precisioneditso why are some caldari ships like the drake so much more efficient than its counterparts for low sp charsthe burden of proof lies upon you because you are saying that years of balancing by ccp is wrong
it does not need to be fixed because it is not broken just like repairer effectiveness  efficiency does not need to become resistance bonuses just because they are inferior to resistance bonuses so you dont think the kinonly bonus is inferior
assuming balance exists then it is accurate to sayship x is balanced against ship y after taking into consideration all aspects of eve combat at player skill level 1ship x receives 105 scalar increase in damage output per player skill levelin order for there to be balanceship y must receive 105 scalar increase in damage output per player skill levelany variance in the level of increase in damage output means it is mathematically impossible for ships to be balanced at all skill levelsthere is your proof that there is no balance
assuming balance proves there is no balance what kind of math is thatbut seriously nowthere is your error the quote above is not what you are basing your argument on you are basing it on the statement assuming all racial ships and weapon systems have identical stats and mechanics if that was true id agree with you
let me rephrase and expand as i seem to be going to quick for youin order for balance to exist the following 5 statements must be trueship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 1ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 2ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 3ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 4ship x must be balanced against ship y at player skill level 5any deviation from the above shows that there is imbalance in the gamedo you concur 
no its well known that the game is balanced around max skills and occasionally taking snakes etc into account as well
i do notyou cant judge a ship by the influence a single skill has on it you need to verify the effectiveness of the ship in actual combat in combination with a group of skillscertain amount of player sp this has to be analyzed statistically to get meaningful resultsfinally you cannot compare skill bonus solely on numerical value for instance an x range bonus has far greater impact on an already long range weapon system then on a short range
allready done  go back to post 152 and download the results on the analysis for yourselfstatistics show a strong favourtism accross all ship types towards minimatar and gallentecmbs with the exception of the drake  cerb score very poorlyif you are a pvpr it wont tell you anything you dont know allreadycmbs are poor pvp ships ie they are not balancedthere is your statistical proof to go with the mathmatical proof and if you are a cross trained pvpr it would also go with your proof from experiance that cmbs are week and have room for improvementthis fix would help lift cmbs and improve overall game balancemore importantly at the same time it would remove the frustration felt by some cmb pvpr at having to fight without any benefit from there hull training in many situationsit equalizes the benifits of hull training across all racesit offers more options for cross trained pvpr who want to do solov small gang pvp than are currently viableit ensures that as caldari pilots train up they do not get left behindif there is any current balance in cmbs id have to say its at low skill levelswhich is why most experianced cross trained pvpr tend to favour gunscmbs just dont keep pace with other races ships as you skill up
just wanted to add one more thing before i sign off for teh weekendon the subject of burden of proofit is not a requirement on these forums to show absolute proof that something is wrongother topics generally get by on an agreedisagree natureif the csm ever raise this topic to ccp it will be the devs job to look at the points raised and determine if there is an issuethey will do the maths and the statistical analysis for themselvesits not my job or responsibility to get 100 undeniable proofif that were the case then no issues would ever get raised players do not have that kind of access to the required stats and you know it
better but that sheet can lead to wrong conclusionsi ship that poses a greater danger is more probable to be primaried so the kd ratio is not a good indicator of ship balancednessalso where did you get those numbers from 32 times more huginns than rooks reallyalso your sample size isnt big enough to produce statistically meaningful results for the lesser used ship classesyour mathematical proof was shiznits and your statistics point to multiple things they fail to isolate the single factor you are building your argument upon the only real issue i see with cmbs is in large fleet fights and in that case damage bonus is the least of its problems weve been over that multiple times i sort of agree for some ships but the kinetic only bonus is not the issuerainbow bonus is not the solution
goddam it why wud it be such an imbalance i mean just take a look at pvp for eg solosolo takes place close range just bcoz u need to get a point on ur enemy so he does not warp out not talkin bout neutsnosesnow look at the caracal just fit a point on it  u destroy a tank that is hardly present anyways so if u want to add a few close range launchers hams u simply end up having a hard time fitting it not even thinking of dmg mods here to have the slightest of a chance in a solo 1v1 u wud need more dps to be able to survive at all saying addin a rof or dps to all missile bonus wudnt make this ship any more dangerous at least not much more than it is now and the carrie might be only the worst example of caldari designs imho cald ships lack gridcpu and im not even thinkin of mwd here try to fit that on a caracal which u wud need if u were going for hams the ship is almost dead in the water and not very useful if u dont have support to back it up all the other races can fit good solo platforms and perform pretty well on their own even the mimi shield tankers have another bonus which is weird if u think of caldari beein the missile and shield race mimi bcs get a boost to shield rep per level and to get that kind of benefit on a cald ship u either have to fly an assault frig or a golembut well ok this is not bout shields it is bout missilescald ships are broken and should be thought over so we get 4 pvp able races and not only 35 and the low sp effective drake is no argument as there are other races ships that are peformin as well as the drake does on low sp funny how everyone mentions the drake 1st and most of the time the drake only imho u should be able to see that ur all reducing caldari to a few ships only and the drake takes the lead supported
caldari is still the king of pveit just lacks options at solo pvp i say thats an acceptable tradeoff
spoken like someone who hasnt spent a lot of time in a pirates shoes or err pod its extremely difficult to get into a fight with someone that doesnt want to be caughtdont believe me ill take my nub ship to any low sec system of your choosing i wont dock up ill give you 4 hours to hunt me down and kill me 4 full hours of glorified huntthegriffin you wont be able to catch mealso im not sure how many missions you have run in lowsec but the rewards are not significantly larger it is barely noticeable especially when compared to the rat bounties  salvage  etc and yes i have run l3s and l4s in lowsec and l1s in nullsec woothe op isnt looking to make pirating easier he is looking to add flavor and reward to lowsec right now most people are in highsec very low risk decent reward or nullsec high risk but high rewards lowsec has no reward that you cant find in high or null sec it has no real reason to exist either nothing that makes it special or interestingpersonally i find the idea of a black market to be particularly interesting perhaps this is a place where pirate ships and modules could be put up on the market instead of the annoying contract system i also find it contradictory that boosters are illegal in highsec yet you can put them on the market what givesnpc pirate factions deserve stations and agents in lowsec it is supposed to be where the criminal elements are yet they have zero presence other than being rats in belts what givesallow corporations to make deals with the npc pirates in local systems the effects can be as simple as the belt rats leaving you alone unless you fire first giving you a possible edge in belt combat and perhaps allowing you to aggress under gates and stations without sentry firefix the lowsec ore so that it is valuable there is no reason to mine in lowsec right nowi bring out this oldiebutgoodie once in a while bring back pirate ship logs these add flavor to the game ccp why did you remove them instead of pointing to the systems with static farmable static complexes allow them to be used to add an expedition to your journal that takes you into a nearby lowsec system also allow them to be turned into the appropriate pirate faction for lp rewards a reward for recovery of sensitive information you can do one or the other get the lps or get an expeditioni also propose that there be a split in invention concord sanctioned invention where things continue as they are now in highsec illegal invention where you have the chance of inventing higherlevel meta items or completely unique items this can tie into the black market idea and exploration sites that exist only in lowsec this is scientific invention that is deemed too dangerous or unethical so cannot be carried out in highsecthis would be awesome
im 100 in favour of 7 i want there to be no possible way to go from minmatar space to amarr space without traversing lowsec etcthis could create multiple trade route pipes the shortest ones would most likely be near permanently camped creating a lucrative smuggling business as daring pilots in covops fast frigates or cov ops haulers get hired to break through these camps to trade interregionally smuggling should not be versus npcs it should be versus other playersyou could basically chose to goa through that one low sec jump from region to region that is most certainly camped orb you can choose to take a more round about route that would lead through 45 or more low sec jumps increasing your exposure but reducing the risk per jump there is too much high sec in the game although i do agree that beyond what ive said above low sec needs a real reason to attract the criminals of eve i really hope that a low sec revamp is included with the incarna expansion whenever it comes i hate the idea of wis for the sake of wis but if it could be coupled with nefarious deeds that could only be accomplished in low sec stations i feel the two could be good bedpartners for an awesome expansion
i would like there to be an option that would allow pirates to gather bribery passes so that you can smuggle drugs into highsec without having to deal with customs agents scanning you down and fining you the dialog box that comes up telling you to pay a fine or die would now have a 3rd option to bribealso transfer of killrights people can sell their killrights on the market that would make for an awesome black market i can see it now right click on kill rights generate kill right certificate and poof a new item comes up in your inventory that you can put for salecontract like a plex with the expiration date in the name like john doe  101010 101010  1 isk
i support the idea of giving lowsec a reason to go there this is the central issue with lowsecs lack of population and heres the thing  all these people talk about remove high sec limit high sec routes to place in order to force people into lowsec forcing people to do things they dont want to do generally fails  you have to make them want to do it which means incentivizing low sec not nerfing high security spacelets face it lowsec has all the disadvantages of nullsec and none of the advantages you cant claim the systems so the sov holding alliances have no real reason to maintain a presence the difference in reward is minimal when compared to the suddenly increased risk versus high security spacewhen you get right down to it wormholes are what low sec should have been in the first place it needs to have something unique in order to draw people there or you get exactly what we have now  a vast swath of space that people rarely visit because theres no reason for them to do so
such as bribing the police to allow an outlaw to operate in highsec for a limited time without being fired uponedit what about missions that send flashy red people into highsec we need someone to take care of a problem in a very discreet manner you will be able to access this system for the duration of the mission dont worry ive made certain that the local law enforcement will turn a blind eye to your presence for now
removing half of the quote change completely the meaningfor your dare if you can do something meaningful in those 4 hours beside jumping from safespot to safespot you are very good and using a ship with a extremely low signatureonly partially true how much sp you have in social skills how well you have chosen you corporation based on value of the lp gallente lp store is the worse in my eyesthe largest gain and difference between high sec rewards and low sec missions come from lp and to capitalize it to the max you need high levels of sp in the special connection skills and use a corporation with a good lp store when you get 3000 extra sp each mission and convert them at 2500 isklp you can gain an extra 15 millionhour if you can run the missions the problem is that it easy to find you and disrupt what you are doingso making it even easier to disrupt low sec activities will not help populating it and i doubt it will increase the fun of those living there
get on with it

totaly correct this is a defniate nessicaty to all wormhole dwellers everywhere
zero risk all reward no reason to get datacores and not even be subbedalso no reason to get datacores and not even be forced to run a mission once in a whileedit to expound on the above everything else in the game requires you to put in continual effort to get any kind of reward aside from skill points if you want to make money you need to do something kill rats play the market blow people up and take their still scam steal produce mine etcdatacores are totally different once you hook up with an agent you just start to accumulate this giant pile of stuff why this is a complete free ride for people with research agents even aside from the issue of accumulating research points while not even subscribedin order to get rps from an agent the character should be required to do or provide something once in a while even if it is something as simple as run a mission for this agent once a week that would at least make sure that the player is actually doing something in exchange for the resulting data cores
i support this thouroughly as it would be a good inprovement to the game
love it
i know this feature has been flooded with support but this is what i see heredominix pilot warps into mission gains all aggro sets trigger to ignore sets drone target priority then goes and watches tv while his drones complete the wave more efficiently than afk mission running has ever been sorry im all for the betterment of the drone interface although tbh ive never had any major problems with it except maybe the ability to controlclick target a drone from the drone ui but there is no reason that drones should have any more ai functions than simply shoot what i tell them to one target at a timei honestly cannot see why anyone should need more than the following three commands which already exist engage selected target return and orbit return to drone baynot supported
i would strongly advise anyone contemplating accepting one of these missions to reconsider the number of gate campers en route is increasing everyday and really who can blame them pve fitted ships piloted by miners and haulers and manufacturers stumbling through several lowsec systems make for easy prey
i support the original post as it was last edited on january 14 2010 152805
that also but it would propably take quite sophisticated atmospheric model to pull that one off would be very awesome i sure hope than when the dust arrives eventuaqlly there will be enviroments available that are similar to the iceplanet hoth from star wars ice and snow enviroments should not be that hard to pull off unless you are trying to create some very spectacular icicles ofc  plus added dangers of slippery surfaces
this would seem obvious to me itd be nice if ccp actually took care of stuff like this first
well im down with it
as a ceo id very much like to see a more reasonable rational interface please

this i stopped reporting the macroers because i only saw one get banned or maybe he forgot to buy plex for a month then was back at it again reported him again hes still in the same system mining what appears to be 237 ccp only seems to care about rmtisk sellbuy if you arent doing rmt they cant be bothered with you at least that is what i feel
supportedi took part in hulkaggedon and quickly learned that insurance payout was more in the end than the cost of the destroyer and its modest fittings combined while at the same time the main target of the event the hulk insurance payout doesnt even cover a fraction of the cost of a hulk on the market without fittingsi agree platinum insurance payout should be equal to market costbut i also believe that there should be zero insurance payout if said ship is lost to concord

sir your post makes a very flawed assumption that the user can prevent themselves from being hackedinfected this is not a completely true the only method to insure one does not get hackedinfected is to disconnect the computer from the network but then it would make playing eve nigh impossible and all of this a moot point a user can get infectedhacked by going to reputable websites such websites can and frequently do display ads which may be from vendors that are not as reputable this is a means to hackinfect other computers or the reputable sites security practices and security updates have lapsed in this case the site can be hacked and be made a relay to propagate malicious software the user has no way of knowing if a site reputable or not is using best practices and is uptodate and even then there are exploits that may not even be known to those at microsoft or in the linux community responsible for rolling out security fixes after all many exploits only get fixed after theyve been used and then discoveredi used to work in it for just over a decade and i can tell you that even though im firewalled keep my system and software up to date have good antivirus antispyware antimalware softwares dont click on every link i see dont click on links in emails or respond to supposedly official requests for information via email from companies with which i do business do not engage in questionable behaviors such as software piracy etc etc etc etc i am still not 100 positive unlike you that i can completely protect myselfone thing i do know is that the useridpassword scheme is 50 years old outdated and outmoded there are many other security schemes which provide much more robust account security for the customer many are very affordable and well worth the extra costs so please before you tell the good citizens of eve that its their fault they get hacked you should educate yourself enough to know what youre talking about
i work with shoshinge and i agree with him on making it an optional feature i would be willing to pay for an eve authenticator as long as the reasonable system to recover the account was in place in case i lose my authenticator
additional account security is never a bad thing imo i didnt see the difference between logging in with and without the blizzard authenticator so theres probably no difference on the usability for the laymanand on that point could those of us without advanced computer knowledge get an explanation as to what an authenticator does and what the potential drawbacks might be
an authenticator is a small device that gives your account extra security you push a button and it generates a number that the server knows to be valid for your accountif you use an authenticator your account will require three passwords to log in the first one is your user name which most people dont count as a password but please remember if someone knows your password but doesnt know your user name they cant log in the second password is your normal password that you are used to typing inthe third password will be the number generated by the authenticator each number generated by the authenticator can only be used to access your computer once ideally this number would be generated from a onetime pad  essentially a list of truly random numbers that only the server and the authenticator share this method is one of the only methods which have been proven virtually impossible to crack if used correctly anyways you push a button on the authenticator to generate the number which you use as your third password and send it to the server the server checks to make sure that the number is valid if the number is ok then the server makes it so that number can never be used again if you are infected by a keylogger the keylogger wont be able to get your password because the password changes each time you log inthe downsides are that if you lose the authenticator you wont be able to log in anymore without help from ccp ccp could remove the authenticator or send you a new one but you would have to prove to ccp that you are who you say you are so that a hacker couldnt just call up ccp and get them to disable the authenticator
id give this one some support whether or not im a geekanything that is optional for the player that enables them to make their account more secure should be made available to them within the means of ccp a simple usb dongle is stupid cheap so 7 should be more than affordable for eve customers and profitable for ccp after all people buy useless key fobs for 20 anyway alreadyso long as its all optional go for it ill probably use some features and not others as long as i get to choose what i want to establish a certain level of account safety currently that being hideously complex passwords i just about have to write down to remember and twist my hands into origami to typesupported
so that means ccp mails us a little hardware widget probably a thumb drive with a onetime pad on it and uses that for an extra passwordand thank you tom clancy for explaining onetime pads  theyre basically a collection of truly random digits on some recording medium with one copy with the user and one copy with the client since theres no pattern you cant predict what will be next on the pad based on previous passwords and thus it is uncrackable unless you can access the pad itself no other system can match the uncrackability of a onetime pad but obviously you can only use a onetime pad once and itd be a very bad idea to lose the padif youre confused about the one time use the pad as a whole would only have one use but you could have a very long pad and just use a small chunk of it each use assuming the authenticator would be on a 256 mb flash drive with 16 unicode characters per password thats still 8388608 uses even if you logged on six times a day 365 days a year itd take 3800 years to use up that single pad so i dont think we have to worry about that authenticator running outam i correct
im not as keen on geographic limitations on an account as that could make playing the game via laptop on the go difficult if not impossiblei do like the authenticator idea i bought one for my wow account when it was released and i was playing wow and though i know you can never be 100 secure i was much more confident in the security of my account once i did for 10 it was added reassurancein the end ill support any optional additional security capabilities added to eve
after a mission i dock and refit the same ship but for salvaging and looting meaning i have to unfit guns and fit salvagers and tractor beams this means its a little pointless to group weapons since once i unfit them the group mode is losti propose that when you save your fit it also saves what weapons are grouped that way when i recall that fit it will automatically group the slots accordingly
a simple and logical request i cant see it hurting anyone or exploitable in any waysupported
support this is a great idea

agreed this is definitely a good function to havei always want to know when my bank is going to be debited again ended up bouncing a couple of checks a few months back because i got hit for 3 6mo renewals within a two week period50 overdraft fees wouldve paid for the fourth account  eh i dont shave it so thin anymore on the money market acct after that little blunder
if your earning pathetic iskhr then someone isnt doing there part i never said you have to fleet up with others i just said it would be a good ideabesides that lets take for example running grusitas haven anomaly because its one of the ones i run more often then not if you do it solo in wave 3 or 4 you end up with a bunch of cruisers that love to use ecm now correct me if im wrong here but 2 ships are a lot less likely to both be jamed then just one ship running itin addition to that 2 ships is 2x the dps or more depending how your ships are setup sure you get 12 the isk but in the end it should balance out because your able to run them twice as fast i mean i might be wrong about this but the idea seems to work pretty well for me and my corp mateswhy would they be chaotic can you not setup the overview to show who is red and who isnt i mean sure local works for telling reds from blues now but without local you wont even know they are there till they hit you or you see them on scan it might mean you have to do a scan of your system to start with to see what ships are in space and look for new ones stay out of the way if your not sure once they get ganked its very easy to tell who then gang was you get this nice thing called a kill mail tells you who did it what they were flying also keep in mind im all for showing the number of people in local so if that number spikes get out or safe upyou mean no more brainless trolls who can see local and warp dont get me wrong i do the same thing you guys do im not some mean pirate who only roams and takes your stuff even though its fun i make my isk ratting too there are other ways besides local to find out if someone is in your system and cloak is kinda ment to make it hard to find you or see if your therei am all for a new intel tool and a new way to see whats in system comming up i said that already all you really need is a number count of how many are in the system and you can get that from the map tbh but lets keep it on the local channel and just not show who is in system just how many ps thanks for considering the big picture and not just how it effects you 
who is upset getting a bit personal are we im having a nice discussion with people who have a different opinion and more power to you its good not everyone in this game is a follower opinions are important in subjects like this and who said it was a requirement i said it was a good idea its what you should do you can sand box it all you want but the best idea without local as intel is to fleet up rat in packs if someone isnt pulling there fair share of work in the pack kick them you dont want them wasting your time but keep in mind risk vs reward the risk its a lot more scary if a blob shows up to kill you if your solo then if your in a gang on the other hand the reward is you dont have anyone else mucking up your isk making1 would be silly to expect you to post with a main on the forums most people in 00 dont so regardless of whats on your tag its safe to assume most people in 00 are in an alliance past that im not just talking about you im talking in general 2 if you rat use the space and do not have a claim to it either by force or by sov then you should expect to be removed if it hasnt happened yet then your lucky or in providence doesnt matter in the end3 the remark on tanking requires you to be in an alliance or at very least a corp with people willing to help you you tank the dps till help can arrive while it doesnt apply to you it does to most in 004 this isnt about you its about 00 and lowsec local and your not the only one in iti didnt tell anyone how to spend their time sure i might have said that its how they should rat if local were to be removed but i didnt say you have to or quite the game now also if i am telling people they should fleet up how am i supporting sitting ducksand you need to figure out its not about you and no one is dictating anything its my opinion that people who dont want team work need to stay where its safe to not be in a gangi already said adding range to the dscanner is a good idea if this happens and if your in a scan site they have to scan you down sure belts is easier to find you they are in the right click menu once again you seem to think the idea is about you your game play style and its not its about the game in general stop making it so personal and take a look at the big picture
1 only we still have localthats why solo ratting is viable if not then no ones gonna move to 00 because whoever ambushes with the biggest blob will dominate the systems plain and simple2 yeah im sure ull ignore the enemy fleet thats 3 times the size of your own closing in on u1 for someone who just want gankings to be easier u sure r uneasy about making yourself a target is your gang not enough to protect u2 or maybe we have a brain and will actually hide fight or flight when u get blown up r u gonna stand there and get podded as well same concept3 most  all4 conversely not every system is sovereigntyclaimed by someone either and im pretty sure i cant take down a pos by myself if for some odd reason i wanted to1 again locals still here and even if its gone there will be no easy targets left or any mediocre targets either gang or no gang2 ure supporting sitting ducks by removing local no eyes  flying blind making easier for ambushes to occur and the smaller gang will die better hope thats not uand its not about u either because once again ull have no one else left to gank but bigger blobs who will roflstomp u if u had your way and no amount of teammates or teamwork is gonna make u feel any safer if ure still outnumbered and hunted downto be continued
1 covert ops cant be scanned downagain2 i already gave u the big picture a million times only the biggest alliance blobs will dominate the systems and any smaller alliances will die from repeated ambushes that they could not see coming til it was too late and i dont have to mention soloers this time cause this change alone wouldve done enough damage already unless ure in one of those big alliances in which case ure only trying to make the game suit only your liking so stop pretending to care about the game itself when u know what the consequences will be
tbh i think your just afraid that you might have to do more then watch local it will be no different then it is now people will learn adapt and move on with there lives in game the huge blob is still gonna get you at one time or another despite your run and hide tactics the number in system counter is all you need to stay safe you dont need to know who is in system just that the number has went up now its time to cloak up find out and hide if its something your unsure aboutyou do realize that no local opens up the possibility of greifing the huge alliances your so afraid of right that now where a cloaked stealth bomber was a minor threat to them its a big deal this doesnt remove the little guys power it gives him more power through guerrilla warfare small team runs in kills a few people runs off and doesnt get caught because the enemy fleet doesnt know where they are its hard to hide a blob even an cloaking blob its very easy to hide 2 or 3 shipsyou just dont want to have to stop carebearing every time someone comes into your system and take the time to find out who it was so far you have been looking at it from the isk making side will it suck more for you sure will it be then end of 00 hardly
nopejust trying to preserve the game for the playerbase and not everyone has the protection of a big alliance not that ud understandthe same goes for u gang or not yet u still dont realize that and whats the difference between this number in system counter and local besides player names did u even mention this once before u suggested so many tweaks that dont even work at all i lost trackyes because a hit and run is the only thing thats needed to finally take down an alliance yeah u can easily one shot that pos or anything thats actually valuable with a stealth bomber oh wait only some cheap ships sitting out of the middle of nowhere is open cause obviously theyre gonna guard everything valuable since they cant see the system yeah u showed them by blowing up that rifter in the meantime theyll blob your own pos and anything else big that u cant run with and theres nothing u can do about it i dont mind when i have to stop carebearing nor do i care who the hells coming through because unlike u im smart enough to not find out the hard wayi never said anything about ratting to make isk did i no i didnt its for security status yeah it would suck for me but its nothing compared to your failed hit and runs because u wont have any open targets of decent value and while your small gang is distracted with that your own pos is being shot to hell because they can defend and attack at the same time
then why change anythingif you make it useless to go to 00 to make isk but instead you should just run high sec missions what then happens to 00 you dont get your easy ganks on mission runners anymore and 00 becomes a pvp area then just add arenas
05 and up as is concorrod is running the show04  01 space delayed concorrod dont like sending techs down there so the equipment is down graded 00 no local like wh space basic services to the people  there isnt even gate guns i like that idea
absolutely support this idea maybe not in lowsec but definitely in 00
not supportedeverybody knows about jf hotdroping now it is difficult with this new local every second jf will die
there are so many overelaborations in here im about to be sick1 lowsec and 00 is not infested with roaming pirate gangs all over the place if you rat in r3 hedgp or sv5 then yeah youre going to run into hostiles quite a bit but if youre in some backwater system in branch you might might see a red or two a night and most of the time that red is just passing through or not even looking to gankstation systems are also popular for roaming gangs most dont even bother with belts except in those extremely populated systems its not worth it when you enter a system because you know 99 of the time the ratter saw you in local and instantly warped to safe and cloakedfor anyone with half a brain local is an instant i win defense unless youre doing something stupid and afk ratting or mining its hard to get ganked in a belt these daysso you swap local out put up a 360 degree pinging scanner that scans to say 1520 au it shows blips based on standings blue white orange red etcnow with this yeah the pirate can see you in a sense heshe knows the general direction to begin scanning while you have an instant red in system reactionthis means that in the minimum of 10 seconds that it takes just to even start warping to you youve already seen hisher presense and have warped away and cloaked unless youre an idiotoh but covert ops what about them well this is tough since you want to keep balance although it sounds fun having recons and bombers having a field day isnt balancing so with those when someone is cloaked the scanner should make a note that there is a possible cloaked signature in system perhaps an omnidirectional ping return letting you know a cloaked ship is within a 20au radius but the location is unknownoh and one more thing ccp add probes as a clickable type so we dont not have to shuffle through 1000 things when scanning for probes so from the point fo view of a hostile you enter system and see a blip or two in a general direction from there you need to scan down the target and warp quickly because the prey likely saw you come in also and is either leaving or ready for youthis keeps the balance removes local and adds flavor to the game throw in environmental effects into kspace from that other thread and things get really funedit make it possible to disable that scanner also because for fleet fights it would be a complete mess
i agree in principlebut as written here mate is not possible make a change only local because jf would be uselessa good idea is with uplgrade system where it would be possible under certain circumstances see localfurthermore in the event that the local would not do that it would not be seen cyno and therefore could jump on the safe spoti think it would be good to do also a module which would in the distances could find a cloaked ship or to give some ships as a property
very well put and you are absolutely right why dont i want to stop every time someone enters local easy because thats about every 10 seconds around where i livefreighter movement too will be severely impeded no way in hell im willing to risk my 650 million defenseless slowashell ship because some pirates that fail at or dont want to properly pvp want easier ganks and dominion or not there are still lots of towers to fuel
ccp wants to change that there come more people in 00 this would achieve exactly the opposite 00 might be sometimes a bit profitable but only when there are 3 people pveing per region and defending a change that will make 00 even more a deserted waste land with the argument that it already is deserted also doesnt make that much sense
that is how 00 is currently not what its supposed to be reread it again if you still cant understand that ill make it easier to understandfirst to the guy running a freighter wtf are you doing running an unarmed ship laden with cargo unescorted get a scout to throw out a combat probe every system ahead of you oh god thats so much workfurb there is nothing but your own personal opinion to the effect it would have on the population of 00 and your opinion based upon your views and style of play so i will have to throw in my own arguments as to why it would become more populated the replacement system i suggested favors an active defender the system is more accurate as it distinguishes not only who is within 20au but also if the single red is afk cloaking or not a bane of all 00 bears it opens the possibility of having a local channel as a sov upgrade it encourages new roles including roles that low sp noobs can fillhow people use 00 and mechanics is not the fault of ccp the players need to work as a group to accomplish goals it is an mmo after all
there is a hude difference between freighter and jumpfreighter for jumpfreighter you have to use cynocynoalt when is cyno up everyone has this cyno in overview for jf is cloaked arazu deadly
only u have to run through the 00 entry points which r usually infested with those roaming pirate gangs to reach those backwater systems and even then u still cant risk exposing yourself when someone patrols through backwater system or not cause the further u r from empire the more time and effort u risk wasting because every system u pass through is a potential camp so if u get killed thats how much more time and effort uve wasted anywaythat wont stop most of them from trying actually it wont stop any of them at allnowinning would be destroying their shipshiding is to ensure u dont get killed in a fight that u cant win in the first place theres a big difference and its not like u can continue ratting while pirates spend hours trying to find u and im not exaggerating either because ive had that happen firsthandthis might actually workit still gives the ratter a good chance of saving himself as long as hes 100 alert and stays aligned at all times because the added scan range will help against interceptors zipping in although it would have to be 25 au since they can cross the added 5 au in a split second but the real reason this could work is that the covert ops tackler tactic wont be 100 foolproof with covert ops detectionof course this is assuming the ppl who want to nerf local r not just aiming for easy kills because now its gonna hinge on whether or not anyone would want covert ops detection even if it wont give away their location if that doesnt go through then the pirates will just go back to covert ops tackling and its back to the drawing board
yes i know i ask again solo sorry how does local help you avoid jumping into a gate camp again how does it prevent you from landing into a sling bubble your paragraph has nothing to do with the subject at handwhy do you want them to stop trying this is a game an mmo at that see thats a huge issue a mentality that nobody should be hostile to youagain what does this have to do with changingremoving local nothing this has to do with your personal opinion that you deserve or should be able to go into 00 without any sort of hostility from other players youre in the wrong gameat least we agree somewhere i have 2 chars one is pvp and a pirate and the other is a carebear i see both sides of thisits not about easy kills its about not having an instant intel tool that hinders the efforts of bothdefenders do not like afk cloakers using local as a harassment tool nor having roaming gangs able to breeze through regions using local to find systems with targetsattackers do not like having an instant warning to everyone when theyre in system that requires no effort at all placing afk alts as permascouts up a pipe for exampleattackers do not like having covops show in local defeating the purpose of them in the first place
without local you have no chance to check if is system clear  cloaked arazuand fyi 1 carrier as escort is not enough
wtf are you talking abouthave corpmates escort your shipnot a carrier but a battleshiphac escort have them there at the cynomy god man wtf protect your crap dont expect local to hold your hand if youre too scared to go to a system then dont goread the thread youll know if theres a cloaked ship within 2025au have someone scan with combat probes also have an escort
spaceholding alliances more often than not use cyno generators at a pos not alts in cynoships
do you know how jump drive worksthere are more jump spots on the way the way can have for example 3 spotscynos or cyno generators between system a and system b let say you have to do this trip 3xab in this case is not possible make escort fleet in ships without jump drivebshac and repeat this every weekthis thread with cloaked arazu without local is same with cynogenerators
do you understand how a jump freighter gank at a cynogen is typically carried out and what shiptypes are involved the fact that youre talking about a bs and hac escort suggests not
constellation locali think delayed local is too severe it would negatively affect both the predator and the prey although i do think with the new changes to upgrading systems making anomalies the more common place to rat rather than asteroid belts now is the time to change the way local functions
hello so what is most funny thing about 00 warfare from my perception war for territory fighting while having an actual goal to achieve participating in large fleets how is local nerf going to help with that i suggest ccp to focus on solving lags that would help people in 00 much morei am afraid that local nerf would also nerf a teamplay the only people who would appreciate that would be soloing cloak gankers who just want to have many easy kills on kb but what do you want on your killboard many battleships as part of a fleet or badgers and hulks solokilled on belts i dont think the second part is something that makes 00 what it is the local nerf would make 00 look like highsec wardecs and lowsec piracyand people who suggest making intelligence service to watch gates  how do you deal with guys who enter system in offpeak time logoff and logon later i dont think that guarding gates would help you against thesethere was also a word about jf hotdropping and possibility to protect it with help of corpmates if 2 dreadnougths jump in and start firing at the jf do you really think its feasible to have jf protection fleet at every jumppoint that would be strong enough to kill dreadnought before it kills jf and what if enemy uses titan can you imagine you are a part of smaller alliance jumping in a few capitals to fight a titan only to receive a response of large alliance that would kill not only the jf but also the capital fleet guarding it small alliances would just be removed from space 00 would be inhabitated only by a few large alliances and bunch of harrassing solokillersand about freighter and other logistics  well you can use scout to find out if there is not noncloaky gang on the way first thing that comes on my mind lowsec pirates enter 00 and place a scout scout can see buzzard coming through gate  command hold after buzzard few combat ships with a freighter are coming scout of pirates says get ready they have less ships than us decloak and kill them when they come through gate dont let the buzzard pilot see you freighter with escort has no chance to detect a possible threat scouting is totally uselesswell afk isk farmers are annoying and local nerf would help against them but it would have to be accompanied with changes that would make possible for spaceholders to defend against solo gankerssuggestions that could help living with local nerf1 possibility to detect a threat somehow but making some effort for it detection of cloaked ships with onboard scanner is good even better would be having covert combat probes that would be capable to detect and locate a cloaked ship scanning could take like 10 minutes why it wouldnt help against active pilots but it would help against recon pilots who enter system cloak on safespot and go afk until defence loses attention afk miners are annoying but afk cloak gankers even more2 jumpfreighters should be able to lock on covert cynos then hotdroppers couldnt just go 100 au away in large system and do nothing but watch if there is a cyno in the overview far from scanning range3 combat probes should be able to display pilots name as well or detect if scanned ship is blue or netralred now scanning an active pilot is almost impossible if he changes safespots this could at least help to find out if detected ship is worth locating
alliances holding more than one or two systems would end up with a nonstop barrage of is xyz system clear and how many blues are there in xyz system we see 5 in local and want to kill in comms without some form of fof system
add this local as a number and this thing and you have a winning combination
it helps before the jump where u have to warp to the next gate nothing can counter a sling bubble if all angles r covered but if there r ppl around that u cant scan down its a safe bet that theyll be waiting at that sling bubble and this was in response to what u said that most backwater 00 systems being empty however u have to go through the entry systems first and no matter how safe a backwater system is all it takes is one enemy u cant see coming to send u back to your clone bay removing local will only make the trip near impossible when ure flying blind while the gangs r not1 its not the fact that they wont stop tryingits the fact that the mechanics favor the attacker to such a degree that removingdelaying local without adding anything else to compensate would only make the gank even more effortless than watching local2 u commented on local being an i win button when all were doing is hiding hiding  winning by removing local u remove the only defense we have left if u want kills that easily ure the one playing the wrong game u can shoot the crap out of anyone u want i really do not care but if ure gonna kill someone with an actual brain dont be surprised when u have to work for your kills especially if ure gonna render them even more defenseless with all the advantages the predator has now i dont think its that hard to understand idk about your carebear but any other one would rather have both sides spot each other at the same time rather than the attacker preemptively scanning whole systems staying out of sight and finding the prey firstneither does the prey like being ezd with absolutely no warning or a chance to survive and afk alts will only cover 1 entrance per accountanyone guarding the gates would see u flicker into view a splitsecond before u hit cloak so your covers already blown anyway when he alerts everyone else
why are you flying solo through the most dengerous space  00  and expect to be safehow is it you are flying blind and gangs r not  they have the same envoirment  they cant kill you unless they actually find you or you make a mistake not only local is the ultimate defense with no effort requiredsomehow even poeple in wormholes manage to escape ganks and now adding few more itel gathering tools to the equasion makes perfect sense what if i come out of wormhole  why should i be visible in local 
is there anything other than ships and containers that needs to be removed from this proposal

thats a pretty bad response are you trying to be a gm or something because thats a typical gm response to just about everythingthis question deserves to be brought up to ccp since todays fleet problems are no different then they where 4 years ago
confirming the above is true i sent this petition a while back and just got this responsehiya ccp could you give me your thoughts on just about everything thanks fmthen i got this responsei dont think this is feasible as a csm proposal first of all we dont know the code second we dont know what efforts ccp has made and is making under the surface to improve the gamegm noahz
hes representing his position as a member of the csm stating quite clearly i might add that they are not entitled to the information as to the inner workings of the client code and server operations and thus cannot decide on their end whether or not this is something they can feasibly bring up with the devsccp the best they can do in their current situation seems to be one ofpeople are complaining about lag they want it fixed but have made no proposals as to how  could you shed some light on how things work so we may present the information to them so that we and the community may be able to agree on things that could be changed to potentially better the situationanyway to the opas mentioned before theres a high likelyhood that all information is created and sent in the same batches per grid if youre on the grid you receive the info whether youre doing anything or notnow what that info would consist of is determined by what the server has to process below is a list of what i imagine it takes into account with parts sent to all clients on grid being marked with a shipid  player weaponid  sent once when you or a new ship land on grid or someone on grid changes weapons  onlines themammoid  sent once unless a client sends an ammoid change request to the server server sends new information in next batchposition  interpolated datarof  interpolated data sent once when ship becomes active on grid or weapon stats are modifiedtracking  falloff  optimal calculations based on skills ship bonusesmodules and other variables etc etc etcdrone positions  interpolated dataitemid  nos neuts sensor boosters etc etcshipdrone hp information  interpolated data with exceptionthere are probably a few other things that are processed and sent or not sent here but these i think cover the more important partsnow in technical terms when information hits your client it decides what to do with any given portion examplesdamage notifications are discarded unless specifically relevant to you an exception here in the form that data for other peoples ships is interpolated whereas yours is not necessarilyweaponid ammoid and itemid can all be discared for the rendering step on the client side if none are being used as per effects being turned off and your not using lookat on any given ship on gridrof only needs to be sent once beyond this the server sends you no status updates for any given ship beyond on or off for that ships weapons if the ship is shooting at you you will receive active batches of noninterpolated data if the ship is shooting at something else your client will process a combination of weaponidammoidrof to determine what the effect should look like  you will receive no active information from the server beyond on or offinterpolated data means that where your client will actively receive batches of information stating playerx used weapony on you doing damagez the hit type is based around a modifier included with the damage amount id guess when you see another player shooting at someone else your client is simply told player1 is shooting player2 and your client references the previously received data for player1s weaponsammorof and smooths the data based on onoff statesin order for you to not receive this info at all the server would have to create a second batch packet for people that dont want them tbc
why this becomes an issue is because of the followingyour client has to still receive that initial batch packet containing the ship weapon ammo and item ids because it cannot afford to have to send you a special packet telling you what module someone has begun using on you when they finally shoot at you that would require extra server resourcesthe server has to send out the same information to everyone on the grid when possible because sending personx one kind of packet and person1 another kind of packet doubles server resources as it not only has to decide what information to include and what to exclude from the packet it also has to figure out who gets what instead of just giving everyone the same thingsomething to keep in mind is that your client is not locally responsible for any calculationswhen you activate your guns your client sends a message to the server saying activating guns the server sends a message back saying guns active and until such a time as your client sends a message saying deactivate guns the server will be running calculations for your guns until a portion of the calculation no longer exists example target lock is lost guns reload or guns are destroyed from overheatingits because of this that you can log off with modules active and they will remain active until you run out of cap your ship disappears from space or their required target is lost  your client wasnt responsible for the server doing things and thus wasnt a necessary component beyond asking the server to start or stop somethingnow for the portion of data where your ship actively becomes the target of effects or you are attacking someone else im not sure how processing is handled my guess is that in addition to the initial packet you received stating weaponid ammoid and rof you will now be receiving a stream of active information regarding whats being done to you  this would i imagine still be sent by the server in batches batches consisting of all the information of all the ships that had to be calculated for a given cycle periodwhether this information would still be interpolated server side or not i couldnt say but i would imagine that it currently is in order to save on server resources  itd be crazy for it not to beso ultimately what i think your client ends up receiving is along the lines of these sets of informationbig chunk of initial grid information updated with smaller batches for new ships enteringleaving grid microbatches for ammoweaponitemid changes on a shipship basisconstant updates of positional data and targetlock references between ships  positional probably interpolated targetlock probably immediately updatedonoff state updates sent to all clients on grid in a chunk of data for effects representationinterpolated hp data sent to all clients on grid using percentage data vs absolute hp data referenced only when you lock a ship ever notice how if you lock someone their hp takes a second to update to what it really is discarded clientside otherwisestreambatches of constant or interpolated data to represent anything being done to or by your ship for visual representation on your client this includes absolute damage data as well as status updates from the server for things such as target lock capacitorhp amounts etcnow as with anyone else in this thread i dont know if this is how things are done this is simply how i think it might be done based on what makes the most sense to me i have no programming or software development knowledge nor degree so i should hope that taking this into consideration the guys that are responsible for eve have a far better idea of how to do things than i do and thus have a far more efficient methodkeeping this in mind can you find any portion of the above information that you think could be reduced or even removed to save server resources because i cant
not supported mwdsince it seems that no one in this thread is old enough to remember ccp removed the use of mwds in dead space missions around 4 years ago back when they added lvl 4 missions which by the way you couldnt solo so yea they removed them for a reason that i cant remember and odds of them letting you use them again slim to nonedamage effects on ships great idea id love to see that added in because the current effects date back to late 04 at least when i started playing
i sincerely dont understand if you reply this way on purposeyou are writing about a completely different subject than the original dude get your act together alreadythe whole point is if youre gangbanged and if you can escape the warp scramble you warp outnow youll have the additional grief of warping back gating all the way into the mission were talking l2 l3 l4 that are common to have more than one gatei propose that you start your mission gate clear of all enemies bookmark get assaulted warp out wait refit go shopping go to china on business warp back into the same pocket you last played intowithout passing all of the gates you already traveled throughnowreadslowlypirates wouldstill need to scan you downand gatethrough the last acceleration gateat least supposing that you didnt move on by thenas a matter of factyoud have all the liberty of warping outknowing that you wouldnt have to travel all the boring and annoying way backsurely the pirates would be able themselves to come back laterbut thats a risk you face if you mission in low secregardless of gates and bookmarkscheck the local channel before undocking again and check the map pvp stats if you want to avoid unnecessary risksso end this clowning already
so let me get this straight your throwing a fit over the fact you got jumped in a mission area went and got your pvp ship then came back and didnt like the fact you went from gate to gate to gate and still got your  kickedwhat difference does it makeso your lazythis changes nothing and forcing the said pirate to not have the same benefets would make this a one sided mechanicso you die faster big fat whoopyour problem is you fail to understand aggression mechanics and you refuse to research itif you bother to pay attention to what we are all getting at youd realize just how foolish your proposal isif ccp and i mean if ccp would grant such a thing everyone would have it whether it be there mission or not due to the great and mighty ninja salvagers opinion in saying we have the right to invade atwillso your going to make it much much worseeven then you fleet up with someone they ditch you now they can invade without going through gatesthis is a precursor to instanced mission runninglike hell thats going to fly
if mwd are allowed in deadspace pockets ceptors who would then be able to tackle a mission runner almost instantly will greet mission runners these ceptors wont be killable by a pvefit ship they would be able to hold a runner in place until the gang comes to kill the runner op likely doesnt want thatif you could warp to a room in a deadspace pocket the same thing would happen except it would be a cloaked ship tackling the missionplex runner the gang would then jump into the system and warp to the cloaked ship right after it tackles the runner as it is now missionplex runners are protected from this as the entire gang has to go through each room in turn giving their prey time to notice they are coming or killescape the ship that tackled them op likely doesnt want this eitherboth features not only slow runners down but protect them
it makes absolute sense to have t2 tractors like we now have t2 salvagers
proposal is consistent w current game mechanics as they relate to associated skills  equipmentsupportedadditional refinements to ops position also reasonable and consistent w game mechanicssupported
supported thered have to be some mechanism to make sure that you cant get away with inject the skill and cancel the prereqs but the op has a good ideathere are two methods i see a to lock the prereqs you can cancel any other skills trained but you cannot cancel the prerequisites of the injected skill b to not immediately inject the skill but rather check the hangar when it comes time and if it isnt there cancel the injection both of these will also prevent people from injecting more than 24h in advance as youd have to have room at the end of the queueas for buffing the queue it is not a combat weapon it is a convenience it does not need to be balanced it is simply a way of improving the player experience
no
i support the ideathe one real reason not to support it is that books have value if i was able to inject books without needing to have the prereqs for them then i can effectively transport books without fear of losing themand people love to see others lose items in a nice fat killmailnow  as others have suggestedautoinjectqueue up a skill which you have not trained for before and then when that skill reaches the top of the queue if you have the book in your station items or in the cargo of a ship you are in not in a container not in corp hanger then it is automatically injected and you continue training if you do not have the book on hand that skill and any others that require it are dropped from the training queueif thats the case  i support it it gives you an advantage to train easily but also means that you may have to carry a skill book in your ship just so that its on hand when you need it the kill mail hunters should like that twist

the current star map is very poor  unusable and needs massive improvement at the least the ability to zoom in and out with ctrl  double clicking region constellation solar system should select and zoom automatically you should be able to set navjump points with mouse by selecting planetsmoonsstructurecomplexes etc
agreed i use external maps like dotlan maps due to the in game one sucks
id just love the old map back the one that doesnt suck
allowing it to be narrowed not only to a system view but a region view would help quite a bit
i support the general idea of improving the star map and ask everyone to take a look at this older thread
whatever id use it
yay
not supportedget another account
for people who can afford multiple accounts this might not sound like a good idea however for people like me who have only one account i support it and know that it would lead to easier skill training
reading with understanding lvl 1
i think what the op wants is that if a queue finishes on one character under the 24 hour period and theres a queue saved on another character on the same account that it automatically starts that other queue instead of the owner having to log on to go apply the new queuein terms of expendable alt generation this would be an invaluable function and i can personally say that i have had situations where it would have been of use to mepersonally i cant support this because it removes a crucial choice i feel should exist in multiplecharacter ownership will you log on to the character you want to start a queue on or will you leave it until youre done with whatever youre doing on another character on the account
supported but only if it doesnt take too long for ccp to code itd be nice but if it requires a major overhaul of the skill training system and server id rather ccp focused on bug fixes and other content
i think the better way to handle this would simply be having one single skill queue shared by all three characters on the same account likely what the op was proposing in the first place it would still span only 24 hours and otherwise work as the skill queue does now the sole difference would be that each of the three characters could add skills to the queue so they would need to denote which character the skill in queue belongs toi would suggest that while logged into any character all skills in queue can be moved within the queue itself as well as removed from the queue however to add a new skill to the queue you would need to be logged into that particular character
funny how pervs seem to be the only ones who dont want this fixedsays it all dont itsupported
im not sure people realize the actual magnitude of this problemwe recently finished a fourweek campaign in fw despite all the bugs and annoying design problems a mostly enjoyable experience  a lot of good fights both won and lost but pretty much the whole campaign was dictated by this game mechaniconce some systems in any area are occupied there is no way to avoid this mechanic in the beginning when about half of metropolis was occupied it was no problem for either side of the conflict to run enough plexes so that by roughly 1800 the plexes were pretty much gone  inaccessible in the systems of different occupation our us and aus timezone players regularly complained about no plexes being there about having absolutely no way to influence the conflict only after dt suddenly there are a ton of plexes again to be had six hours of dedicated plexing later and most if not all of them are gone  until dti didnt think this game mechanic would have such a huge effect even when there are a lot of systems to respawn in but it doesof course the fewer systems there are the more obvious it gets fighting for siseide and lantorn was just plain silly dt starts everyone get on vent twiddle thumbs or browse the web wait for tq to come back up tq up log in log in log in 7 wt in local 2 meds 2 major switch to med sized ships meet at  go go gousually by 1300 it was all over the 12 systems were confirmed plexfree the only time they would spawn plexes again was tomorrow during dt fleet can stand down everyone can ignore the systems until theni had some of the most awesomest engagements i have had in eve so far here its sad that it only happens at that time of the day a time i might add when im usually in the middle of my work daythis mechanic is silly beyond belief
does anyone else here think petitions are taking far too long to be resolved has anyone who has been  is involved with the csm seen the processes behind what the gms have to dowhy do other mmos seem to have gms that can resolve issues alot quicker and with alot less fuss
theres the help channel theres the rookie help channel and the last few times ive had npc alts theres been no problem asking questions in the npc corps chati fail to see the problem
all answers ive asked in the help channel have normally been responded upon within 1 minutei really really dont see the problem since i just open rookie chat ask a question wait for answer then close the chat when i get it maybe throw in a thanksnot supported  why is it people need this 
i dont quite see a problem here eitherif the flows too quick you can ask in the npc corp chat  if its full of spammers or other trouble makers you report themsegregating the help channel into startercorp specific channels just seems daft to me as any given channel might need more help than another one this would create extra work as well as many more channels for those wanting to help players out in that they would need to actively monitor several channels instead of just one to see where help is requiredit could also very easily result in one common question being asked at the same time by a different person in every one of these various channels where a single person could have answered it in a single channel and helped 12 people at once  with your proposal the same question would have to be asked and answered twelve times at once only to be asked again a few minutes later by another new character in every single one of those channelsi cant support this
i went into the help channel last night for a look and agree there is a problem no mods or isd at all to much chitchat a big prevalence of fast short and very poor answers to questions resulting in the same question being asked repeatedly answers that left you wondering what question they applied tonot convinced multiple channels is the solution but there is definitely a problem support for further considerationdiscussion
go back and read the posts againobviously your just throwing a fit to throw a fitdo you even know what happens do you know how it works do you work for ccp what authority do you have to make these claimsor are you just making assumptions and conclusions based on what you see like you usually dostop whining seriously ccp did a good thing with this current system if you cant be arsed into clicking report isk seller then dont come crying to usyou may think nothing is being done but honestly i like what it does it reports it and purges the entire chat log of said offender pretty damn nicefor crying out loud man
yes they did a good thing now the feature needs improving to include autogagging with some rulesyou are mistaken that it purges the chat this effect is only for the user submitting the report and does not effect any other userim well aware of how long petitions used to take and how long they take now spammers are spamming for longer without being removed under the current systemshout down this issue all you like it doesnt make you anymore intelligent or any more importantplease continue to bump this thread with your moronic personal attacks
ok so lets step back for a moment and look at the was and is thenit used to be that if some guy was spamming in local you had to open your petitions screen get to the relevant category copypaste at least one line of the guys spam take note of the location date and time of the offense and the specific name of the person you were reporting then you had to confirm it was the right person and click submit petitionat this point your computer could lock up for anything from seconds to minutes for whatever unknown reasonthe player would be able to continue spamming in local until such a time as action was taken against them in order for their text to not flood your chat buffer you had to then right click them and click blockin order for your block list to not fill up to its 80 character limit youd have to potentially carefully sift through it to remove all the isk spammers while retaining people you want to keep blockedall of these various processes could take you several minutes to complete for any one of them but ultimately resulted in the offending character being removednow if someone is spamming isk selling sites you right click  report isk spammer  confirm the name in the box and click yesthe character is instantly reported with no locking up of your client at all they are instantly essentially added to an invisible block list for at least you their previous spam is removed from all text windows for at least you you dont need to go manage your block list especially for that character at allnow thing is as with the previous isk spammers if enough people report the same spammer they will quickly get banned  reason for this being that as with the old petition method the reports for any given character goes into a single file based on the character name  get enough reports in one file and it gets knocked way up there in the queue of tobecheckedout namesthus removing it becomes far quickerthus ultimately the character not only gets removed far quicker than it used to but you are able to nearinstantly remove all offending text from your chat windows report the offending character and essentially block them without the block list nearly instantlythese result in the followinghappier players since they waste less of their precious time and effort to report spammershappier gms since they get reports of spammers quicker than before as well as far more substantial evidence i imagine that all text spammed by any given character is automatically included in the report  you know all that text that gets removed from your chat windowsless frequent spammer attacks since they get swatted quicker than before and have to try and come on at peak times when they can get the most exposure now vs doing it nonstop all over the place and players can report them easily and quickly even if theyve already changed several systems since the character was spammingso yeah unless youre sitting there in the offices with the gms responsible for banning isk spammers and can see them doing less since theres less pressure now i dont think you can at all make such a claim if anything as they are receiving a multitude more fleshy reports now than before i think the pressure has only increased with themif spammers get blocked the way you say ie their text doesnt get removed for everyone just you  then the gms still have to step in to take that character out of the game before more people are exposed to its spam that havent yet reported it the same way they had to do before the report function
i suggest you dont report one and youll notice that theyre getting up to 70 or even 90 messages outpreviously they were lucky to get past 15 messagesim simply bringing this to attention here as given the way the feature works no one will ever complain the feature will remain unimproved forever at least with this small amount of discussion someone may think to further automate or improve the processin its current state no improvement will be made as its a hidden problem with no complaintsa feature can be improved even if no one cares about it or notices there is an issue at all
actually i havent had much of an opportunity to report isk spammers latelyi used to have almost one per day to report with them passing through lustrevik or even piping up in rens  these days besides the fact im hardly ever in either anymore an isk spammer is such a rarity in either system that everyone talking in local or even watching it is surprised to see onejita is has and always will be one of the prime targets for isk spammers because its where a massive percentage of all the isk in eve goes there is little to no way to automate the detection muting and subsequent banning of isk spammers that doesnt threaten to have an impact on general gameplay for legitimate playersif a filter is created the guys running the bots will find a way around it if limitations on the ability to talk in local are imposed the bots will begin joining lists of player channels instead if limitations on where trial accounts can join or talk are imposed then therell be a massively detrimental effect on the overall newplayer community more so than the current isk spammer issuethe issue is not hidden by any means the report isk spammer tool is merely a way for players to better maintain their side of the game to improve things for themselvesif you have any kind of magical function ccp could implement that couldntwouldnt have a negative impact on the playerbase as a whole that would remove isk spamming as a possibility entirely then by all means suggest it
why the hell would we want to not report an isk sellerspammerseriously what is your line of thinking thats like saying theres a problem with gun controlso instead of locking the gun we should go ahead and shoot ourselvesfor crying out loud its just a little bit obvious that your chat screen would get flooded by isk spammers thats the whole reason the reporting feature was added to get rid of it and bring it to the attention of ccpyou have a serious problem with your logic that or your drinkingseriously are you really that hard up to click your mouse just to turn the problem offim starting to think you need a vacationand if its really that big of a deal to you spend less time whining about it and more time coming up with a rational solution
i have an alt in jita as do most people i rarely see isk spam anymore rarely adding a rightclick will just allow people to falsely report someone else as an isk spammer and pull out the i was drunk and i meant to hit whatever right click option would be above or below it as it is now when someone reports another player as a spammer it is pretty clear they meant to
makes sense to me trade grid for cpu adds options based on having to make fitting decisions
that is indeed the best course of actionwe have a specific procedure in place for any complaints regarding isd members and i can assure you all such issues are investigated fullythe gm team and the isd star team work closely together and have a liaison to discuss any such issues with the respective teams currently this is me however the liaison position is not fixed and may change to another gm at a future point in timeif you encounter any such problems please file a petition under the game masters and isd category and we will be able to look in to it
im totally down with this
opposed this is asinine suggestion the stuff is created by the the salvager is doing the salvage work a legitimate miniprofession a miner putting a mining beam on roid first doesnt make a second mining the same roid a thief if you want to salvage fit the gear to your pve ship and salvage as you go
agreed with a twist i agree that its a legit mini profession but if a straight up flag were put in place it would stop those from trying to work as salvagers so how about this  first two hours the wrecks are marked just like loot cans color the wrecks accordingly so folks know that its hands off unless you want an aggression flag thrown up after that period the wrecks are free game and the color is switched to let folks know theyre free game wrecks after that two hour window are considered abandoned basically oh and to boost the profession a bit more allow salvagers to scan down wrecks yeah

theres discussion on the topic of account security over in the assembly hall thread provide services to improve account securityi for one do not like the idea of limiting access by ip address or range since that prevents me playing eve from friends places or from the caravan down the coast when im on 3g wireless and interferes with my game play when the isp changes the block of ip addresses that i might be connecting fromi would certainly like to see a last connected notice on the character selection screen eg last connected 1045 gmt from 123123123123

i support no insurance payouts on concord kills
lol and you believe thisother races are as good in missions as the caldari or even betteranyway im sure you think raven  its tiers concidered best for pve  oh and it doesnt have the ty kinetic only bonus what a coincidence
i dont really understand the argument against removing the kinetic only bonus and replacing it with a rate of fire or all missile damage for caldari missile shipsi mean a raven can do any damage type does a lot of dps with torpedoes granted cruise missiles blow right now and is not considered to be overpoweredsomehow a caracalkestrelect with a rate of fire bonus or damage to all bonuses would bewhere is the logic in thatthe whole racial damage thing is stupid projectiles do a myriad of damage minmatar do not get a bonus to damage types nor does any other race they get a bonus to their weapons not the freaking ammo yes t2 resists are supposed to boost the ships defenses against their racial enemy and thats fine but still its silly to say caldari should be the missile race and most of their ships only get a bonus to 1 out of 4 of missile typesso yes caldari should have depending on the ship a bonus to rate of fire missile damage or both honestly for most ships id be in favor of missile damage as it conserves missiles gallente drone ships do not get a bonus to only thermal drones yes they are generally the most favorable drone but they still are fully capable of fielding any type of drone and getting full bonusesminmatar ships do not get a bonus to only fusion ammo mostly explosive by the same argument as people are using against missiles you could easily say that minmatar should only receive their bonus when using explosive ammo or a gallente ship when using a thermal drone but this is not the case so why are caldari stuck with using 1 type of missile why do we lose our ship bonus when we switch damage types to gain tactical advantage missiles already have enough going against them in pvp can we at least have our bonuses no matter which missile we useoh well thats my two cents
i actually avoid ravens at all costs cause i know how good they arekinda like vagabonds ships you know that if flown correctly will whip your asscaracal and its assault launchers would be a beast with rainbow damage against frigates it already is i really wish my thorax got bonused to a gun that shot light ammo like the caracal doesdrone aregument kinda fails note there are like 4 drone boats and 1 myrmidon is slightly broken so i fail to see how 3 ships really break the balanceminmatar get less damage and fight in falloff plenty of reason to give them sorta rainbow damage imo
because they are not arguing but trolling
yes youre right because you fail to prove to me why this change should be implemented and i keep providing counterpoints i must be trolling if you dont win nobody wins nice third grade attitude right there
i do believe it and general consensus backs me up drakes and the three raven based ships are extremely popular in the pve arena the fact that raven does not have a kinonly bonus is a complete unrelated point since i was responding to a claim that caldari is underpowered as a wholeyour point that raven a ship with omni missile bonuses is not imbalanced and thus every other ship will not be imbalanced with omni missile bonuses is blatantly fallacioususe the report button on the right and see what the moderators decide
i like this idea but could be abused to allow criminals into hisec by acceptinga a mission then using the time to wreak havok in hisec there would need to be some safeguard to stop this like for instance if you warp anywhere except to the mission point concord will still get youand will the people arguing here stop it this is not about making life harder for carebears it isnt a hisec versus lowsec argument it is for the sake and enjoyment of lowsec making it a better playing environment for anyone who wants to live there i dont care if hisec folks come to lowsec or not i am interested in making lowsec enjoyable by itself

totally agree this is a much needed improvement you can build t3s from sleeper salvage and gas polymers but you cant fit and change the subsystems within the whs im sure it was just an oversight on ccps part that this has occurred but it needs correcting sooner rather than lateri also think a more substantial review of all things wormhole would be useful with the opportunity for those of us that have spent any length of time in whs to contribute these and other ideas

id say this combined with a variation of the original idea have merit i agree that target priorities for drones would be nice i understand the viewpoint of the poster who made the sarcastic remarks about something similar for guns however guns dont work like drones for starters theres no rigs to boost nonsentry damage and theres no drone related implants1 skill gives 2 targets per level max of 10 at l5 sounds good2 can prioritize based on hullnumber good 3 i disagree with the ewar setting personally thats getting just a little too finedetailed on the settings at that point youre almost programming your drones with an ai subroutine no4 tactical drone reconfiguration module fleet drone tacticion module this and the prerequisite skills could be the key to giving motherships their own unique role carriers can launch and assign fighters but motherships can control the drones of the fleet would make them unique simply adjust the drone control link which allows an extra drone per level to instead let the mothership control up to 5 drones assigned to it 5 of these and the tactical module functions similar to triage however it gives bonuses to drones such as speed hitpoints etc possibly damage a bit iffy there and the mom can now control 25 drones from the fleet and assign target priorities and a few subbehaviors for groups4 is a combination of the op and the quote and my thoughts on how to help balance this idea while giving a unique role to the mothership instead of it being just a carrier mark 2 obviously leadership advanced drone control and possibly a new skill would be required for 4 but thats not a big stretchi support the premise of the ideas but there definitely needs to be more discussion on the exact details and numbers as well as how the proposal would effect game balance
i did one of these the other day with a friend he is only doing l1s and got this im l4 for 6 monthsit took bloody ages in his crappy ship approaching an hour hes not too good either i didnt fight just kept an eye on localafter 45 minutes in comes a group attempting to tackle luckily my agony experience meant we were off grid before any consequence but they just sat there knowing they were griefing the missionthen you come to the mission rewards including travel time it took over two hours so theoretically between the two of us one mission runner one monitoring local etc your going to need to earn about 150 mil plus at level 4 or if solo youd have to factor in losing a ship a fair few times again at level 4 with a caldari fit youd probably need close to 300 mil make your own call on level one average earningsall we got was an implant work about 30k and some pathetic bounty not even some faction lootmissions are all about the iskhour this is totally uselessi think i might of seen this concept before oh yes level 5 missions any takers anyonemore of the increasing threat to force pve players into pvpwhy do people play pve well because some really like it and play eve to do just that it aint broke stop trying to fix it there are two worlds the pve and the pvp there is already enough overlap there called salvaging theiving

as a long term director in a corp this has my fullest support
omg yes
lacking a better term for the title this proposal has to do with the character transfer mechanics specifically what happens when you log into the web based account management page this does not have to do with the sale or method of sale of characters it is only dealing with what happens after you have provided a credit card number to ccp for transferring a character to another accountthis proposal is to address two issues 1 helping to simplify and identify characters who have been transferred from one account to another2 help with some cleanup on the character datapart 1im proposing that when you transfer a character legally via the ccp approved method via their website ccp does not place the character immediately into the new account instead ccp transfers the character to a ccp corp concord pilot relocation services or some other such roleplayable corp name after spending 10 seconds in this ccp corp it is then transferred to the proper account specified in the transfer section of the web transfer services pageby spending 10 seconds in concord pilot relocation services indicates that the character was sold and has a timedate stamp in their ingame employment history to prove such part 2regarding the character data cleanup i think it would be helpful if while in the concord pilot relocation services the character got a clean slate i propose that at that time during the character transfer process should the original owner choose to the following things happenedall bookmarks deletedall buddies deletedall block lists deletedall personal standings towards anyone zerod out or nulldall kill rights tofor nullifiedall evemails are deleted except agentall evemail notifications are deleted except agentall combat logs deletedpretty much a general clearing out of the people and places section of hte characteragents and other nonplayer data can stay putnote wallet history and contracts are not part of the cleaningregarding the should the original owner choose to i would imagine a checkbox on ccps character transfer page allowing the original owner the choice of clearing out this data or not  clean out people and places during character transfer  do not clean out people and places leave data alone if i missed anything else you can think of for deletion please feel free to suggest iti think these two things would help the remaining players know when a character sale has happened in someones past and provide a cleanslate to the new owner of the characteri dont see any sideeffects from this as once a character is transferred its no longer in your control were making that publicly transparent and removing any liability of that from youhopefully other people see this as a good thing and vote it uprespectfullycyrus ageisedit typos2nd edit spoke with a csm rep regarding this proposal had to modify it a bit turns out that ccp doesnt allow a char transfer via its web page without the char in question being in an npc corp anyways removed the part about dropping roles also clarified the people and places cleanup portion with an option on the transfer page to clearnot clear the data on transfer making this an optional step

as a network technician for an isp irl i would love to hear you elaborate on thisi could use a good laugh
yes pleaseplease give us the option of using a hardware based authenticator
after playing for 4 years i dont want anybody non ccp to be able to get acess to my accountand if where on iti want my avatar to be flagged unsaleable and locked to this account
this proposal is about several things1st making it easier to understand what the hell is going on for noobs2nd making it look cooler and more cinematic for someone who is just watching a fight but has never played eve 3rd making it more eyecandy and epealing for everybody4th making it easy to understand what the hell is going on withought looking on the overview and reading notifications those where my goals if i have not quite achieved them please point out the holes and lets work on improving the proposal together because i think they are worthy so first of all somehing that bothered me for really long time if someone shot my interceptor with an ammar dread and missed can i actually have him miss instead of having a beam 5 times the size of my ceptor burning my ship for 10 seconds and my ship staying absolutely intact yes this means if the shot did not do any damage and missed then the shot goes away somewhere next to the ship into deepness of space in my personal opinion that would grately improve visuals for those flying smaller ships in bigger battles as no longer wil an assault frigate speed tanking a bunch of npcs become invisible under the sheer amount of missiles and plasma that all hit the same spot on a tiny ship if i fire as a ship and miss my shot goes into darknes of space if i shoot with a weapon group and barely scratch dealing 14 normal damage then only 2 out of 8 guns hit the rest will miss this required no adjustment server side as your client already knows who missed and who hit you all we need is an animation not that much of an animation anyway should be rather easy to do i am not a game developer so i might be wrong on this but the second thing when i shoot a titan with barrage of 8 missiles all missiles do not just go and all hit the same window i know that we are trying to make a hole in the ship but when a 100 bs launch 8 missiles each and all 800 missiles start hitting the same window it looks wired another request would be to add a tick to remove self effects what this means is i wil not see armor hardeners sensor boosters or any other nonremote effect modules activated on any ship except mine yet i will see everything else this si more of a lag improvement but in a large fight i really dont care if someone is sensor boosting and will remove alot of strain from my pc without damaging the overall look of the game much missile hardpoint and missile launchers get us missiles coming from different sides of the ship instead of all coming outta same spot in my personal opinion warp scrambling effect needs to be much more vivid maybe we could have an option for this afterburners and microwarpdrives can we please have animations and different animations for a microwarpdrive and an afterburner this is both for the sake of eyecandiness and for the sake of clarity i want to know what my enemy is using currently i cannot see anything well last thing is drones can we please have the drones shoot a ship while the guns are facing it yes i would like the drones to orbit a ship with them facing the ship and the thruster looking the opposite direction looks stupid when guns fire sideways might not be important but should be rather easy to do how are they gonna turn vectored thrusting also maybe we could have both drone guns fire simultaneously so it looks a bit better that is all for now if you have more ideas or you have found some holes please tell me i will adjust the suggestion according to whant discussion comes tosuggested by burseg sardaukar
missiles visual effects are boring id love to see it overhauled and yeah from multiple points of the ship would be nice its lame the way it is
i am all for more realism in the visuals supportedits not like the eve client is a very demanding client and i feel that ccp is slipping away from the former glory of the best loooking mmo
support useful function never did like the way it just boots you without warning
1 because not everyone has the schedule to wait for other ppls schedules to match perfectly to gather a large enough gang and outblob any possible gate camps on the way neither do they want to split the rewards among the large gang either unlike a pirates killmail which everyone gets2 gangs have scan probes3 refer to 2 they can still find u local or not thats due to the incompetence of the gankers which is why this proposal was madeu just dont understand that other players r not rats they dont log on for u to shoot fish in a barrel with but if they were hunting u down as well u wouldnt have to track them down and complain about it would u or r u only aiming for targets u can ez with no effort required because u can still ambush someone in the destination system without any warning otherwise it wont do much to alliance assets like everyone else seems to suggest but as usual it looks like ure only after easy kills anyway
keep one looking over their shoulder
just go in wormholes  they are there for you waitingfull of excitement  treasures and the gank you want end of storry
where did you hear me say the word unescorted freightering through 00 is interesting enough as it is no need to make it an even bigger timesinkoh wow a combat probe ok 4 carriers a dread a paladin 3 sbs rapier arazu and a load of bs and bc sure the carriers and dread are probably in a pos the pala is probably running anoms but what about the rest hello any pirate in herewell same goes for everyone i guess  providence has so many blues neutrals and reds its hard enough to tell them apart already if youre not in one of the bigger alliances theretheres no way youre realistically going to be able to have a modicum of safety if you cant tell red from neutral at a glance just imagine flying through highsec knowing everyone in local can come at you at any time but without the red and blue markers imagine one in 20 times you undock or jump you lose a ship because you have no way of knowing the probable intentions of those 20 or 30 there with you in system the only certainty you have is they are out there and out to get youyou cant lock down gates you can only hunt and hope to get but not in your isk making machines i havent seen a single argument that would give ratters miners or haulers more survivability i can really only see ways for gankers to get free killsim specifically not going into pvp as the above is pvbarreledfish because every time i see hostiles roaming and we get some response fleet the hostiles turn around and flee just like the ratters they were trying to gank flee as soon as they think theyre in danger the roaming gang or solo pirate with alt or whatever has as much to gain from local as intel tool as the cannon fodder theyre so eager to ganki see wspace mentioned a lot as a prime example of why it would work in 00 well not in my opinion but ppl in wspace have proven they can survive too11one true but they choose to go there they willingly take the risk and they are semiprotected  left alone because their gates have to be scanned down and disappear all the time if wspace is soo great a by all means go there i wont stop you and b why isnt everyone thereeve is a sandbox and different aspects of eve attract different types of ppl if you drastically change some important parameter and removing local as intel tool is just that a major change you will upset the balance and i am absolutely certain this change will not lead to ccps stated goal more ppl in 00 as the only ones not in 00 are either carebears that are already hesitant to risk their ship or pod which will happen to them in 00 doubly so without local or ppl in wspace and why would they come back more risk for less gains for them
supported on the basis that ccp will have something replace the constant spamming of the dscanner that you get in wspace
earlier i posted a proposal with two bundled changes one change was well received the other wasnt so now im reposting the good one alonewith quantum rise unguided missiles rockets hams and torps were nerfed among other things in their ability to hit small targets ie their explosion radius was increased but even before qr they were already penalized in that they dont receive the explo radius bonus from the guided missile precision skill now they are penalized twice in the same area among other things this has led to unguided missiles underperforming and having low popularity theres a reason why rockets are currently also being called roflkets a small buff is needed and would be welcome by many so without further ado i proposechange the guided missile precision skill into missile precision meaning all missiles get the explosion radius bonus not only the guided ones
is this really a big issue people seem to be using them all the time so is this a necessary change or just a whine about the good old days im not a regular missile user so i havent been keeping up with the missile issues rockets sucking isnt a reason to do this though it is just a reason to boost rockets
you can speed torps to 60 dmg with a mega without any propulsion mod while the blasters wouldnt be affected too badly
can require a bit of balancing in other stats but supported
then you should read up on it the new speed paradigm combined with the unguided missiles lack of skill support makes them incredibly midslot hungry as you need painterwebscramble mwd killer to apply the full damage this goes for both hams and torpsop supported with a caveat  they need to be tweaked to avoid them becoming god weapons whenif full tackle is acquired ex torpedo ravens and ham drakes can be immensely powerful as is when they make the midslot sacrifices
emphasis mine why shouldnt they be powerful when they give up tank isnt that a major part of this game to find the right balance between tank and gank
problem mining ships have almost no tank a ship specifically constructed for mining in space would not be expected to have much in the way of armor or shields as these are very combat specific ship attributes however you would expect ships built to handle tons of dense ore to be solidly build as in they should have some structure unfortunately this is not the casesolution greatly increase the structure of all ships built by ore 23 times as much this will not greatly effect ehp in most setups as people will still choose to maximize their mining ability by using all low slots towards that however people who choose to fit a damage control will have a nice level of ehp to make the compromise worth it sustained tanking would continue to be shield based as is now it allows for mining ship fits with a decent level of buffer tank at the expense of mining ability unlike currently
and then you start a process of teaching every miner to fit a damage controlmore structure doesnt make sense without the dchas about 25k ehp needs a 5 cpu implant
currently shield extenders and invuls provide a resonable hp buff however i would not mind increasing hp to let ore ships withstand highsec smartbombs i am neutral by large on this
this may be true but more structure would make sense for something that looks so friggen bulky and takes so long to aligni support this
that is exactly the point players who choose to use a dc in their lows instead of a mining related module have the chance for a much more effective buffer which doesnt effect sustainable defense without the additional structure mining ships are very limited into the size of the buffer they can have enhanced structure makes sense for a rugged mining ship as opposed to increasing shields or armor
supported although ships and cans should be excluded and thered have to be some sort of method for handling damaged drones and modules also it should be optional probably something under esc  general settings

dear ccpearly this morning an epin battle unfolded in jc between large forces of various factions unfortunately it failed to unfold completely and was then miserably crumbled down into lag and failure by the almighty hamsterhand this was the kind of battle that if it had gone well would have been great pr for eve as a game hundreds of people and thousands of  of equivalent real life isk involved in a big battle with lots of pretty explosions as a resultwith apocrypha you did a great job of improving on the lag problem in fleet fights however it seems like dominion took all that spat on it and flushed it down the toiletproposal fix this shizzle sokps logged back in with 70 shields on my lev f yeah
so this is what we have on the csm this time around huhson i am disappoint
you know id expect to see some random noob with 2nd grade education and the iq of a wooden stick to have posted something ridiculousbut a csm delegateand a member of trihow ridiculously hilarious and embarrassing it must be for you guysoh uh cool story bro1010 epic fail
i agree with both of you this is a huge disappointmentthe whole csmwtbbraincells part that is 
lol  replies to oplegit complaint about a game that has taken a huge step backwards in terms of stability precisely when sov mechanic changes encourages upheaval in 00 multiple comfirmed irl idiots chime in with pointless personal attacks right on cue they really really should stop posting and buy more plastic spaceship models from ccp  to play with in the bathtub

while this is true what makes the op think this needs yet another issue thread given there are already dozenswell lets be nice and say welcome to the dominion lag whine club
i never said i was for or against the issue i actually support the ops uh proposal if you want to call it thatbut i would expect a representative of the csm would at least come across as someone with half a brain and the ability to communicate with a little bit of self respect and pridenot like some 5 year old whose drunkyour csm for crying out loud not some random joe tri or pirate or whatever look the partor dont bother at all your just embarrassing yourself when you go all omg ur g8m is brk3n haxbut dont expect anyone to take you seriously now 
besides the fact that you dont seem to know me what is your problem i voiced it as nice as i could let me assure you there is a lot of rage going on offscreen that certainly has no place in this section of the forum see pl titan loss threads the trouble here is that ccp is undoubtedly aware of the problems yet gives no sign to the player base that it takes them seriously and is working on solutions other than a few lessthanwell coordinated sisi testswe have seen so many fancy stuff introduced in the past years yet the progress on the core events that make eve great has once again grinded to a halt
your right i dont know youbut what i do know of you is you emorage post topic titles omg ccp set us up the bomb and people are going to wonder what the hell is your problem first impressions really do countmaybe it should be issue serious lag problem with fleet fightssaying fix ur game comes across as some foolish little 5 year old throwing a tantrum making demands to ccp whom is not likely reading this aside from moderation and when some common average joe pilot shows up and finds out your a csm hes going to wonder if its just a bunch of whiny kids who cant be arsed to spellspeak english decently and spends all of its time whining and raging over a problem albeit legit and you being csm youd think its a bit of a foolish notion to demand something when your supposedly the conduit to get that issue raised up to begin withso yeah what little i do know not impressive to be sure
sokratesz i am not sure you can really say they are not taking it seriously there were a big testing round early in january no the silence afterwards isnt nice but might be a sign that the problem is harder than expecteddid tri participate in the testing in caod they were just joking that it would be the best time to attack ncpls titan losses well they havent learned from the mistakes of wi it isnt that wi didnt whine enough in caod and other placesall in allwould it be nice that ccp would give some feedback on the progress yesdoes it need more threads about it no
supported i dont really care how this csm delegate words his proposalwhile i am not directly affected by this issue it stung to see that slashdot post a couple weeks ago commenting on a large fleet fight that was full of fail due to lagccpplzfixnowkthxbye
do you see me emoraging in this thread am i making ludicrous claims or unrealistic requests its rather sad that you fall back to childish accusations of rl incompetency going only on the thread title
thank you so very much for proving my pointbows out
so what was the proposal exactly fix the game dont you think theyre tryingheres some premade proposals for you to try out next time you feel the urge to postcan we get an update on what caused the lag and whats being done to fix it maybe a timelinerollback to predominion code as a solution to lageither would work better then the fix your game strategy you so brilliantly employeddont get me wrong im not upset my csm is a douche hell as long as theyre not selling their vote or exploiting insider information i figure theyre pretty much harmlessccp not communicating with csm is the equivalent of giving stupid kids nerf bats you do it for their own safety and to protect everyone around them
thank you so very much for proving my pointbows outwhat point that you judge the metaphorical book by its cover
confirming that this isa not caod phew but why the epic caod memes b battle was epin c in the entire 2 hours of fighting i laid down a whooping 4k damage as mods set with autorepeat off auto repeated for 2 hours d lollerskates at people smacking sok in this forum 310 way to dissolve the powers of csm people that are your voice to ccp golf clape love this game but its so ed at timesyou can pay me in corp dictors sok ive come into help whip the welpstrolls
hellowe in the wormhole community have been mulling over this idea for a while now and im sure kspace miners and likely pirates too p will love it as much as i and everyone else have loved the idea so here it goesdevelop an ore faction control tower small med and largeor at least large with bonuses to either1 refine wastage percentageor2 cpu and power requirements of refinery array equipmentnow obviously there has to be some sort of downside to being so industry awesome i propose that the towers just have no bonuses to defenses like normal towers do but this is open to discussion of coursethis would provide the needed industry love ccp needs to give us and a nice fat juicy target for harvesting care bear tears for those piratey types d
this would def be interesting a 25 bonus  to max out the refining
anything that possibly increases wormhole trafficlife is good for my killboardc5s are too empty imo
i like the ideathe issue i see is that ccp may want to keep refining levels low to force players to decide to take the lower return on refining or go back to a stationed system similar to the decision to give the rorqual the ability to compress ore instead of refine
perhaps maybe give the ore tower the ability to compress id be content with that as well
well i did not want to increse traffic i like my fairly quiet piece of eve  i just wanted a refining bonus  i get enough random traffic in the c3 i currently occupie  an exit opens mostly to low sec occationally to null sec and once every couple weeks to a high sec exit  with one exit bouncing around between more locus space and the occational null space exit 
i like the idea also altho i think a more substantial review of all things wormhole would be useful with the opportunity for those of us that have spent any length of time in whs to contribute these and other ideas
numbers need tweaking but good idea
i like this idea
interesting idea i like it maybe boost the max refinery effeciency to 90 on the intensive array to have a middle ground between normal pos and outpostnpc refinery
nice idea
supported so long as its balanced
as a worm hole resident i fully endorse this productchronos
like the idea supported
it would appear that with the dominion patch more than ever are we experiencing large fleet fights of 1000 pilots while both player and developer alike are enchanted by the thought of large internet spaceships reducing each other to slag en masse these fights are also come with a deeper more personal and much less glamorous struggle that has ended more ships than anything during these large serverbreaking fightsthe struggle to get the damn grid to load while your ship sits helpless and targetableas it stands a player who has jumped or jump bridged into a loaded system and especially into a grid during which a battle is taking place system and grid both take a very long time to load usually never loading in the meanwhile the ship that player is flying appears on grid but since the player cannot see or do anything as he hasnt loaded grid yet the ship is left vulnerable and can be shot down without incident by anyone who is already on grid since a defending force is usually already sitting on grid waiting for the attacker this puts them at a very solid advantage as they have already loaded grid and can shoot down the ships of an attacker before the offending pilots even load grid while this is a solid slap in the face to ccps usual lag affects both sides equally statement and also brings into question a number of networking issues that ought to be resolved this isnt the point of this post as ccp is already trying to resolve its network issues such that those efforts areinstead the goal is to address this specific problem being that a ship belonging to a pilot appears on grid and is vulnerable before the pilot himself loads grid and can actually do anything leaving it defenseless when it should be otherwise participating in battle and defending itself to correct this i would propose not displaying the ship or its warpinjumpin animation until after grid has been loaded while this doesnt solve any netcode issues and people may still get stuck loading grid at least they wont have to worry about their ship blowing up while theyre stuck once that persons grid has loaded then the server can display their ship and they can participate happily in the fight
yes altho this should only be a temporary solution till the grid load issue is fixedi experienced the issue once myself and many times where fleet members had it
if it is even possible to code then that would be the most elegant solution of allperhaps make ships visibleprobable but invulnerable an indefinite gatecloak seems a little meh and would benefit an attackerjumper far more
supporting a fix to an issue i hae not personally experienced but has still gotten significant negative coverage outside of the eve communityedit supporting something i support
this is something thats troubled me for some time nownever experienced it but i would rather not experience ityoud think there would be some sort of communication between the server and the client to be able to indicate youve loaded onto the gridbut potentially there could be an exploit here as wellsupporting with caution
the issue i see here is that you would have fleets loading grid piecemeal and becoming visible in small groups you might take 2 minutes to load grid but your fleet mate may take 1 minute hes dead long before you get the grid loaded and become a viable target this would effectively act as a nice force multiplier for any fleet that you jumped intono
supporting although i dont see how this would be possible to code the way the devs have described the engine
an elegant solution but i fear it will be difficult for the server to objectively determine whether or not a client is ready
assuming the grid takes ages to load because of server side delay in computing  sending all the grid info to the client its very easy to determine when the grid loaded after all grid info was sent to the client
from what i gathered in the past it is usually the client that is unable to keep up with the server loading all the decals and models for example and working out all the gfx effects that also explains certain weird behavioural thingies experienced under heavy lag such as drones doing full damage over time for the server even though they show as doing nothing for the clienteither way if they can make it work in a fair way it would be awesome hence why i support it 
this would mean that turning all effects off and setting graphics to minimum would reduce the chance of getting grid load lag or reduce the time it takes to load the grid this hasnt been confirmed yetwhat has indeed occurred is that client side performance as in fps dropped if that is or isnt related to grid load also hasnt been confirmed interesting enough the grid load bug only seems to appear after jumping or portaling never when warping to a blobyou can speculate if this is a new form of desync just to exemplify it takes some time to compute the subset data the grid and send it to the client if this takes too long the simulation advances in the meantime hence new updates have to be computed and sent this is possible as the server code seems to not process each request with a strict first come first server priority order ever noticed that under extreme lag movement commands are responded to more quickly than say ammo change if the client waits until it is in sync with the current simulation tick it makes complete sense that it fails ever to become ready if the server is under high load and takes too long for each update
good idea
i was always for drone damage mods i see a number of issuesfirst of al what stops a domi fitting 6 small mods will they affect only drones according to their sise then what is vexor supose to dosince it controls large drones as well although they are easelly fixable no stacking penalty for them please because in effect they work like a gun
with no stacking a dominix using sentries could almost do close range bs level damage at sniper ranges or an ishkur could almost double its drone output lets not go there eh op how do you propose to handle balancing if practically any highslot can be used wouldnt it be better to restrict it to utilities and add 12 to various ships
while not a bad idea in itself theres no mention of the cons as well as the pros who it would affect or how the mechanics would be implemented as such it is an idea not a proposal that could be voted ongiven the dire state of 00 lag rockets and some other aspects why should this get dev time over fixing fleet warfare timer bugs or some other majorly broken mechanicthat said id be happy to see this mechanic implemented especially if it made ganking cnrs easier  it would have no major impact on how much isk you can make from a mission because anyone seriously running missions for isk doesnt warp out anywaymwds are not allowed in dead space because it would make speed tanking too easy and theres various issues around greifing too that are not mentioned in the opgiven that sleeper ai is the way ccp are moving forwards in terms of npcc youre not going to get the change to npc tracking that would be required for mwd usedebated and discussed many times before so its safe to say that wed all like to see stuff like this ccp has the get out of jail free card that it runs on a single server so they have to impose limitations beyond those of other mmogs but itll be interesting to see what happens once more single server mmogs get off the groundon the assumption that the op isnt a troll the op is lacking the experience to educate others about the full implications of the proposal and lacks the maturity to learn from others
even though this mainly helps people not get ganked i see this topic from both sides of the argumenti dont want to get ganked while doing a site and i hope they dont see my probes as i lock them downas a wormhole dweller i have been on both sides of this situation equally we my corp regularly run sites in our home system and neighboring wormhole systemsat the same time and more often i have been the one at the controlling side of the scan probes looking to lock down an unfortunatethe idea im posting is simple and possibly mentioned beforemake all scan probes an option in overview filter types this way less clutter is shown on directional scan if profiles are made properlyit may also reduce lag as less items are needed for directional especially if you are within range of multiple possmore based from a wormhole point of view it will help in highseclowsec 00 and any future systems where local is not an immediate intel piecethough it may be necessary to introduce an increased scan time for filtered options after all your onboard computer has more to worry about

honestly if you can scan it with your ds you should have the ability to slap it in your overviewsupported
currently its just an annoyance to look through all of your ds results theyre still there but you have to manually filter out all the crapsupported
i like the idea also altho i think a more substantial review of all things wormhole would be useful with the opportunity for those of us that have spent any length of time in whs to contribute these and other ideas
supporting this as well and thank you to song li for raising my cans and wrecks scan proposal
htis is absolutely nessesary
as a wormhole resident pvepvper i fully endorse this ideachronos
ive strongly supported this for a long time watching for probes is basically a requirement yet the process is made very frustrating by what i think is a poor mechanic while the time required can be mitigated by sorting the results it is still very common to have to sift through dozens of containers pos modules etc the new probing system allows one to filter out extraneous results with a great deal of granularity i wish the same could be said for the directional scanner at the very least can we get an option for setting the scanner to remember the index of a highlighted result to avoid having to scroll down again on every single scan
problem currently losing implants is one of the main fears newer players or carebears have about trying pvp they might be willing to lose their frig cruiser bc or bs but their 2s 3s 4s or 5s are not something they are willing to risk jump clones offer a possibility to avoid this loss but the 24 hour timer doesnt make it convenient for someone to try pvp without prior planning however removing the timer would make jump clones overpowered as a tool to move around the universeproposal implement a new type of clone called an implant clone there are no standings required for use an implant clone allows you to switch to a new clone for an isk fee your clone with implants gets left in the station and you get a brand new blank clone this can be done instantly and you can switch back to your clone with implants whenever you wish however when you switch back your blank clone is destroyed you can only switch between the implantblank clone instation to prevent it from being used as a quick transport mechanismwhat it would do now if someone wants to try some lowsec or wh pvp they dont have to worry about losing implants getting a jump clone etc it removes significant barriers to entry for players who wish to attempt the pvp lifestyle more players trying pvp can only be beneficial for eve in the long term
solution to your problemjust put 2 implants into your pvp clone for the stuff you are currently trainingyour loss gets greatly reducednot supportedyour limitation with switching back to the implant clone wouldnt work i am in my blank clone pod express do the other side of the map pew pew pod express back to my implant clone jump back into my implant clone voila
this
while this works for older players it doesnt help newer players who dont have the standings for jump clones or arent in a player corp with standings the mechanic is designed to help new players get into pvp without having to deal with jump clone timers standings or risking implants
theres a corp that offers jump clone services cant remember its name but im sure someone will bring it up here
click me for free jump clonestop service use it for all my alts
waste of developer time pause and apply are easy enoughnot supported
i always hated this part of the system players should be allowed to plex no matter what time zone they live in instead of being restricted to right after dt
i fly a rook very little and think it would be really fun but there is a huge problem with it it targets out to 180 but has nothing that can reach that far ecm is only good out to about 53 before ecm falloff heavy ii missles only go out to about 90 at the most my question why is the rook so underpowered blackbird ecm range is better and the ship is a whole lot cheaper it makes no since to fly a rook especially when you can fly a scorpion for alot less my isk was wasted buying an inferior ship please see what you can do do help the rook out thanks
short version rook and falcon 30level jamming strength bonus scorpion and blackbid 15level jamming strength bonuslong version you might consider the wee fact that maybe longrange ecm is not the rooks forte and that it gets phenomenal dps for an ecm ship when loaded with hams even without a single ecm boosting module on it you can still get 4 racials with 1125 jam strength 424 dps and 19k ehp without even trying hard if you want longrange ecm go for the scorpion if you want costeffective ecm get a blackbirdlearn to fit the ship to the niche role before making a complaint thread in the assembly hall the rook has good dps and more jamming strength than any other ecm boat the scorpion has very long range ecm but has less jamming strength the blackbird is the cheap ship far more easily replaced than either of the above dont complain to us because you cant figure out how to use the ship properly
when you get accustomed to using ecm you will invariably be sitting as far out as is possible while remaining effectivelong targeting range means near immunity to sensor dampeners which can be a godsend as it is the only reliable counter to ecm besides raw firepowerit is a good thing that the boats are now different want range you go t1 want staying power or cloak you go t2  apart from ecm mechanic being a snooze fest when smaller numbershulls are involved the ecm ships are better balanced than they have ever been
i fully support this petitions are taking way to longless beer drinking more petition answering
i am raising this
cmon we all must be getting tired of spammign the medslots with cap rechargers from time to time when it would be fit with sensorboosters for triage carriers or somethingccp bring in cap charge 1700 or something for them it even sounds coolit could also help for when capitals need to gtfo but they havnt got the cap to jump lol
why would you want a sebo on triage carrier
for reps idk im not a cap pilot can you even use anything other than reps while in triage lol
then make proposals about ships you do pilot not supported
so what makes you an authority on such a subjectobviously your notnot supporting
because it was only a idea pi dont see why not being able to fly a said ship means i cant bring up proposals on them
aw gee lets think could it be that your making an assumption on something you have no bloody idea about
story of my life xd
oowow your honest enough to admit itmy hat goes off to you siro7your a rare sightin all reality we should let the cap pilots do the proposing when it comes to capital shipsthats all im sayingso come up with ideas over areas you know very well not ones where you dont
tbh we need capital microwarp drives too
and capital nanofibers
350 ms doomatar
that would be so awesome then give moros special ability to move while in siege and it becomes a proper gallente ship blasters  mwd
right up to the moment he meets my capital energy neutraliser
my capital cap injector will easily give me cap during the enormous cycle time a capital neut would have
this proposal includes two parts1 change the guided missile precision skill into missile precision meaning all missiles get the expl radius bonus not only guided this would be the much needed and welcome buff to roflkets hams and torps their base expl radius is already penalized there is no reason they dont get the benefit of the skill2 add a skill that also gives turrets a sig radius bonus it is unclear why there isnt such a skill already given that guided missiles have it some sr turrets will need some rebalancing for their base sig radius but this can be discussedshould be tested out by ccp if implemented
2 we call that motion prediction which does exactly the same
that is incorrect motion prediction gives bonus to tracking compensates for target angular velocity which is loosely equivalent to target navigation prediction for missls compensates target absolute velocity there is no skill that decreases sig radius for turrets
turrent damage isnt that badly depending on the sigradius as missiles are last time i checkedeg turrets can still even one volley npc frigs try the same with missiles
yes for missiles change not sure if the turrets need sig radius skill i am neutral on that
the missiles that most need the explosion radius bonus unguided missls arent affected by the skillwhich ships are you talking about even a 45mi sp caldari char can onevolley most npc frigs and destroyers with hmlsall guided t1 missles have the same base sig radius as their turret counterparts correction cruise missls even have 300m vs 400m for the turrets and they get the benefit of the skillid like to see lr turrets getting the same benefit as for sr turrets i was suggesting a small nerf to sig radius to compensate for the introduction of the skill bringing it in line with the sr unguided misslsyes i know the proposal has ramifications and requires some rebalancing as for proposal 1 i think its very fair since after the missl nerf the skill effect which was the previous penalty to unguided missls wasnt revised iirc
i was talking about bs size weaponssorry for being unclearwhat makes it pretty hard to agree with your proposalyou mixed 2 related but different proposals into one you would mostlikely get lots of agreement on the missile part but the turret part seems unneeded
ok look at cruise missiles for instance they have a 300m sig vs 400m for turrets and they still get the benefit of the skilli did both in one proposal because i think that you cant implement one without the other or youll create an imbalancei can see why you think they shouldnt be together as one is a buff to unguided missls the other a buff to lr turrets yet both are based around balancing towards the same thing guided missls already get the skill benefit sr turrets arent penalized
yeah but correct me if i am wrong for turrets the sigradius only matters for tracking not for the actual hitting dmg and motion prediction improves your tracking no
you are mistaken sig res is unrelated to tracking if your guns sig res is bigger then the targets sig res youll be doing less damage tracking is related to your targets angular velocity ie with increased angular velocity you hit for less when approachingpassing your guns tracking amount
actually he was correct which is also the reason why i made my first post the only thing affected by the sig radius of a gun is its effective tracking so motion prediction effectively already does exactly the same the damage a turret will do agaisnt a target where tracking isnt an issue is completely independent of the sig radius of the target and the gun unlike missiles
im inclined to disagree with the turret proposalsig radius on guns vs target effects damagetracking effects accuracyto the best of my knowledge not damageguns have a random variable in there somewhere i say this as a gun userexplosion radius on missiles vs sig radius of target effects damagetargets velocity vs explosion velocity effects damagemissile damage is almost static from volley 1 unless target changes speedsig i say this as my alt uses missiles and i have caldari friends who have also confirmed thismissiles arent effected by angular velocity or tracking they always hit however any movement at all reduces damage even if 0 angular ie target moving directly towards youi dont have enough experience or knowledge about unguided missiles to really say one way or another
this is the overall hit chance formula for turrets both turret tracking and the target radiussig res ratio influence hit chance but turret users can only improve tracking via skillfor missls a different formula is used tracking vs target angular velocity is replaced by target velocity vs missl velocity target radiussig res remains the same but missile users can improve both via skillthis is incorrect as long as the target isnt stationary in that case hit chance tends towards 1 anyway target ressig res has an influence the formula corroborates thisyes but when you average multiple shots some hit well some not the effect is a reduction of dpsyes i know
now if you would have bothered reading the tracking formula you would have read that sig radius of guns and target only affects tracking of your gun nothing else so if tracking isnt an issue guns deal full damageand since they only affect tracking motion prediction does exactly the same
the name tracking formula is a misnomer it is a hit chance formula in which tracking and sig radiussig res are an input parameter both parameters have influence as they interact in a multiplicative way only one can be improved by skillto demonstrate lets use a numerical example gun with 005 tracking 20000m optimal 400m sig res target at 20000m 250ms traversal 250m sig radiusinserting those values into the formula gives a hit chance of 895now if we increase target sig radius to 400m or decrease gun sig res to 250m hit chance becomes 957the only moment tracking isnt an issue is when both attacker and target are stationary relative to each otherin the missile formula explosion radius and explosion velocity are also related in a multiplicative way even if less directly both can be improved by skill
explosion velocity and radius skills of missiles have different effects adding a skill that reduces sig radius of guns would have exactly the same effect as motion prediction
that is indeed true you could simply double the bonus per skill of motion prediction to achieve the same effect but i dont think that is a good idea as youd also have to double skilling time and you wouldnt be able to apply the bonus to only lr guns also true but in the end both skills help get higher damage on targets that are smaller than exp radius and faster than exp velocity while for turrets you only have this one 5 per level skill the hit chance formula is kinda lame tbh for not differentiating between tracking and sig res
things you forget you can speed tank missiles with flying straight awayto the ship ever tried that with a turret boat tachydon one volley frigates  missiles got consistently lowered dmg from speed tanking turrets still got the chance of getting wreckingfull hits in of course from the perception with looking at the dmg messages it will look like i constantly get crap hits but i am sure the average isnt that bad the real effective dps applied to the target is situationalall in all i am not really sure this proposal is needed at all sorry
correct but turrets also get less average dps as soon as the target isnt in optimal while for missiles it stays the same across the whole rangewell yes thats the beauty of the different weapon systems each is subject to different factors and thus have different strengths and weaknessesthats ok its not like i cant be convinced otherwise in a good discussioni will still open a new proposal thread for proposal 1 as it seems quite a few like it and were only not supporting it because of the tied proposal 2
proposal adjusted here
and this is different from keep at range howid rahter just see keep at range expanded to include all objects instead of not letting you keep certain objects like wrecks at rangenot supported
i think right now we see a range of transactions one could assume that the bottom end are buy orders and the top end are sell ordershowever id like to be able to separate my graphs into transactions occuring just from buy orders or just for sell orders to be able to better understand whats going on1 is there a way to do this already2 is there a good reason this shouldnt be done
it cannot be put on the agenda for this meeting because the thread will only have been up for 5 days even though i support itthe thread will not have been up for 7 full days before hand it is only out by a matter of hours though
dear csmi just found this post after wondering what had happened to the csm after noticing the sticky new dev blog the csm in hindsight and for the futurei then read one of teadazes minutes to see the only post of note was someone having a good moani bet this is an old record but i think more needs to be done to attract attention to the csm something needs to be added in game
for next meetingalso the wiki links that were changedkillmails
i hope by next meeing you mean the one on the 24ththat is the killmail link again im going to upload the updated proposal for account security  lock characters tonight
yeah 24thandwtf
and please dont forget that one
you have the same wiki link twice once next to killmails and once next to shield bonus  check your post
some peopleall looks good to me keep it going
agreed and what a gain of time if thoose modules could be implemented by upgrading posreal stations for owned corp its what we want 
supporting this and all please xx
doooooo iiiiiittttttalso modular pos would rock socks
i dont think youve thought this through as well as you believefirst  youre masking issues that are better addressed in other ways than using insurance fraud as a covera mission runner can pull more mineral income than a mining pilot i got 778 megacyte from level 1 missions when i switched corporations to mission run for a couple days not level 4s  level 1 mission recyclingrun a single mission as fast as you can loot everything head to a base and recycle it all this is where the bulk of your lowsecnullsec ores come from in highsec and you sure as hell arent making a lot of anything without those higher end ores  which your miners are not getting in highsecif the bottom drops out of the lowest end minerals who does that hurt if the bottom keeps dropping on the higher end minerals  who gets hurt if trit doubles in price the impact on low end ship manufacturing will be trivial when 1 megacyte is equal to over 1000 trit against the cost of manufacturingthink about it its not the low end crap that makes it possible to make the ships so cheaply its the lower costs on the higher end ores and those are not being mined in vast amounts by your highsec miners yet it keeps showing up in larger and larger volumes on the marketwheres this supply coming from not minersyes  i support this idea
yup suicide ganking is too profitable atm and its not like this would make the tactic obsolete
how is suicide ganking risk free  it is penalty guaranteed is as much as you will soon be movement restricted or spending considerable time in npc 00 again risky grinding up standingsyou are disingenuously considering financial loss as the the sole factor of risk and as has been previously explained the reason there is currently no real financial risk is due to over production of minerals by a largely afk hisec population
i think you are mistaken me to support ganks i do not at least not in the way it just happens after dominion a hulk cost nearly 200 million isk how long would a person who play just the economical part of the game need to afford this with a retriever 2 monthimho it would be only fair and realistic if the same amount of time would be necessary for a ganker to do such a thing technically i have no problem with the ganking itself just with the considerable timeloss you have how can it be possible for 4 people save 4 times 600k to buy 4 catalyst and destroy the work of month and beside the modules get the 600k backi read that with the right tactics during hug2 you were able to restore the standings for one gank in 1 hour just 1 hour compared to 2 month they say eve is clearly a game to fight it may have been so in the beginning or intended to be but now the economic part has grown so much that it is a symbiotical relationship if miner would suddenly stop for 1 week or 2 the deliveries for the so beloved tru sec action would stop and their game would suffer as wellno insurances for concording regaining standing to enter high sec must be equal exhausting like the victims effort getting their values back
please stop embarrassing yourselves trying to convince the rest of us that this sec status hit is actually a cost ive read threads in cp on how to recover single gank sec status loss in under an hour you show me how to earn enough to replace a 200 million isk mining ship in an hour and well call that even  until then dont feed me that crap about how the sec status loss hurts you its an inconvenience nothing more
scc arent entirely controlled by concord they are merely supervised and fall under the concord banner
since i started playing suicide ganking has been nerfed at least 3 times if insurance is removed ill still do it everyone else will still do it even if it does reduce occurances do you know whatit still wont be enough for the carebearsthey will lobby more and more for changes and reductions
no it would not the minerals from mission runners and 00 industrialistshauler spawn would probably be enough 00 industrialists might even be able to make isk from their ships then
is mining in highsec suppose to be a risky activity whats next sitting all day in station and trading is risk free let us shoot through station walls or smartbomb everyone inside
mining in high sec as it is is hardly a risky activity with an occasional suicide gank at least there is neglible risk the problem with mining is probably the extremely low need for any sort of interaction that naturally leads to afk miningbotting and in turn makes you a better target for suicide ganks station trading is risky in the sense that you could lose isk
funniest thing is that a lot of the time although its profitable people actually suicide gank to get the hate mail and the tears from the victims just like in low sec so unless you have a cure for that then well youll never really stop suicide ganks 
i think its because they dont want to lose there easy targetsyou know targets that they can be pretty sure will be doing kinetic  which they can tank stronglyits not just raven dudeconsider the sacdouble rainbow damage bonus to high damage heavy assaultsperfect slot layout to fit scramwebinjectorab or mwdlow slots for tanks with godly resistsyou can even get a nosneut on thereit should be the most popular shortrange cruiser in eve if you listen to half the people posting in this threadbut no one flys them  cause even double damage bonused the dps is fail compared to most short range blasterac boats
youre the one saying rainbow missile bonus is so much better and that it is unfair for missile boats to not get them by your logic the sac should indeed be popularmeanwhile you might be interested in this proposal
yeah  why dont they fly sacri  other missile boatsexcept drake if those are so awesome and balanced
youre a fool what short range blasterac boats the blaster deimos and the automuninn nobody flies these either its nothing to do with dps its because flying a 100 mill hac that does less dps than a bc with less tank and has to go into tackle range to apply that dps is suicide
i have updated the original post to remove the most unpopularunviable bits not including the emo posts that are convinced i am just trying to get more carebears into lowsec to gang when the oposite is true what this is about is making lowsec a place for teh people who want to live there not the occasional visitor
i encourage a much needed lowsec boost to give it more purpose
i agree make it so you can change modules and sub systems at a pos

my eyes are getting older and small fonts become tougher to read which makes my old eyes tiredplease include a setting in the game to set the font size significantly higher i think that this is in the interest of all players  if not yet then it will become an issue in some years for many people playing eve
this has been discussed at the meeting today and was deemed not good enough a proposal so i will ask those who voted against with what kind of compromise they can come upthe argument that shield and armour are inherently different is a sound one however enter a bonus that is the same non different oo on both platforms and one of them is at a strong disadvantage there and then the argument suddenly stops making senseadditionally it was repeated that shields receive an advantage in the form of recharge  however in my opinion that advantage may hardly carry the name because the actual hps gain of shield tanks is very small unless the ship is specifically fitted for it but pvp ships for whom gang bonuses are most useful rarely if ever are and a small increase to something small isnegligible
not supportedill support it once you change the suggestion to include a shield recharge penalty proportional to the capacity bonus
i was thinking of thatwould it really be that easy
it would be as simple as one more formula for the server to calculate basically after bonus shield recharge is replaced by pre bonus shield recharge thats simplified for the math disabled get a math dweeb to come up with something more polished what we have are shields and armor yes theyre different as it stands now with fleet bonuses applied you would have to be a moron to use a shield ship if you cared about those bonuses at all reasons why are shield recharge is too low to fill up the shield capacity the bonus gives youmost shield ships are buffer fit not passive tanked and not active tankedany interuption in the bonus resets the shield to the lower amount when it returns you have to fill it up againbasically i see three options for a proposal1 make armor not fill up automatically when fleet bonuses are applied just like shields dont fill up now the capacity is there just not filled2 make shields fill up as armor fills up now when bonuses are applied this may or may not include a condition of using the prebonus shield recharge as the ships passive recharge bonus3 make a timer so that when the fleet bonus is interupted the shields dont deplete back to their unbonused state automatically this would allow shields to be repped up or passively recharged and hold their bonused amounts long enough for a jump through a gatecons shields and armor are different and both should have advantagesdisadvantages some could say the way it is now is a disadvantage meant to offset the advantagespros shields as they are now are so blatantly worse for fleet pvp that they are largely unused none of the three above solutions will nerf of buff armor or shields in my opinion they would make shield ships more of an option in fleet pvp againalso fitting requirements of shield rr mods sucks balls not the issue at hand just throwing it out there sucks balls
not supported unless armor gets a passive regen added in aswell
small bump since i would like to see more votes for itits only a minor fix so should be easy to implement right
and 1 more thing need fix that damn neutral overview setting ccp6 years ago nothing happend with that if remove neutrals from overview setting the wartargets dissapear from overview too

not supported but clearly failed to be understood by anyone last time so will make another post id like to ask a question thats been hinted at but not covered in this thread why is there an oversupply of mineralsthis could alternatively be asked as is there a group of people who would stop paying for subscriptions if minerals dropped below a certain priceits my belief that the ops proposal would hurt ccps income it would drop the mineral price floor raise the price of plexes and hurt newer players rather than older onesan alternative suggestion is that rat loot gets dropped as bpcs apologies that i cant find the post where this was mentioned but it really is a much better idea the implications are however hard to understand without first understanding the plex marketimagine eve players to be on a scale from grinders at one end to pvpers on the other end a pure grinder would probably have three or more accounts and do nothing but mining and industry whereas a pure pvper would live entirely off player loot and plexesccp have a very strong financial incentive to keep both extremes happy a miner who can keep 3 pvpers paying for plexes is doing more to cover the costs of our servers and fancy graphics than those of us who buy long term substhe result of this is theres an optimal plex price which provides the highest number of subscriptions and dropping the mineral price floor will alter the grinderpvper balancenow that weve introduced the concept of plex balance lets take it one step further and consider average joe to do this we have to revert to the original question and ask why is there an oversupply of mineralstheres a fundamental difference between game world economics and rl economics in that a rl person working for minimum wage will find it hard to buy a new mercedes whereas a veldspar miner needs to be able to buy the occasional geddon or cerb and loose it in pvpessentially there needs to be a very high minimum wage in eve otherwise casual players become the equivalent of burger flippers at mcdonalds and simply cancel their subscurrently this minimum wage is provided by two things missionrat payouts and insurance payouts the current problems with ship insurance being more than the production cost of a ship are caused by the minerals from missionrat payouts undercutting hard working miners and thus forcing them to live on the dole insurance payoutsto put it another way average joe who doesnt have the backing of an alliance has to choose from rats roids industry or piracy as a way of making a living so if theres a game mechanic rat loot that undercuts one of his options roids then he needs concord payouts to survive as a miner or has to ditch this profession altogethertldr and the reason im not supporting the opdropping the insurance payout forces people to ditch a profession through a bad game mechanic and fails to tackle the root of the problem changing rat loot from modules to bpcs would see the removal of a mineral fountain the introduction of a mineral sink and ultimately raise ship prices above insurance prices
so you think ccp should abandon miners to the free market even if that means loosing subscriptions haha good luck with that bear in mind that a free market can not exist inside a virtual universe where the developers decide how big asteroids are how much ships cost to build etc how many miners we need is 100 decided by ccp and theres nothing the game market can do about thatif you understand the root of the problem then why are you advocating a drop in the mineral price floor that would potentially drive people away from the game rather than fixing the mechanic that is driving down mineral prices
every other profession gets abandoned to the free market why do miners deserve special protection and subsidy are you saying that people who mine are all incapable of adapting and respecialisingbecause miners deserve the advantages of the free market as well as its rigors thats called balance

a way to use a base price on average market without the possibility to exploit this by placing buysell order is to base ite on an average price on items solds you can place buy or sell order the price you want but people wont buy a drake for 300 m anyway the other option for insurance is to have a real insurance system this mean if you loose ships the insurance cost will be every time higher some weeks or months without big losses the insurance price get loweredit has to be calculated but i think this way you will take care of your ships in pvp the ships could be insure by the corporation or not insure at all it will also introduce a new system of valor  i take care of my ship i dont want my ship destroyed even if its not the factional battleshipby the way it could depend on isk loss of ships so if you lost 15 frigates its not a big deal for insurances but if you loss 5 battleships

agreed eve is supposed to be a beautiful game im tired of it looking dated the second someone fires a gun
i like thid quite a bit my corpies and i were discussing possible ideas for hud effects like blinking red capacitor if ur being neuted maybe a fogginess over the whole thing for damps a red speedometer for webs blinking for scram a red aura around the whole thing if painted scrolling matrixcode crap if jammed blurry for damps and some kind of effects for tracking disruptors itd prob get overwhelming if it all happens at once so maybe specific areas of it for dif ewar
suported this would save a lot of hassle and losses
oh ffs this kind of thread looks pretty stupid when you support your arguments with nonsense try reading up on it
yep ccp overnerfed missiles explosion velocities by a huge amountwhen speed was reduced due to missiles nearly did 0 dmg strange they forgot to reduce turrets trackings
personally i dont think a torp should be able to hit a frig maybe hit a cruiser or destroyer but anything above that is fair game in my book
lol a torp pilot is already happy when it does full dmg to a battleship we dont even dream of smaller stuff

its 4amive just had two awesome peanutbutter and jam sammichesits very much past when i was supposed to go to bednow that thats out of the way ill extrapolate a bit on thiscsm  appointed by ccp as community representatives from the communitys side as opposed to ccps side responsible for siphoning issues or proposals that appear to weight the most heavily on the minds of the eve playerbase as a wholecsm  members of which are voted for by players whether legitimate or at all valid cannot and probably should not be investigated fully  its everyones responsibility to vote etcnow dont get me wrong  ive been playing eve my fair share of years like any other average joe but i do expect a little more professionalism from the csm of the first two years candidates that i saw the level of professionalism was generally fairly high  the csm members didnt present issues the same way the average nerf ninja salvage threads ops do  they detailed the situation at hand and made structured proposals for those issuesccp is in all likelyhood very aware of lag issues for large fleet fights and they are likely even more aware of the fact that even when dedicating a considerably large portion of server resources to any given systems there is still lag to the point of fights becoming unmanagable for the clientsmore than this they by now probably have a few good ideas as to what is causing the lag and are still busy trying to find ways around or through whatever those may bewhat doesnt help them is when the people they have appointed thats you in the csm cannot offer proposals even at a level on par with or above that of a development greenhorntry to remember that those responsible for developing and running this game also play the same game on the same server with the same issues as youtry to remember that while you are a member of the csm you are meant to be above us simple folk  if not then we might as well all have a csm badge under our avatars because were all equally qualified to come make proposals that should be taken into special considerationthats why im disappointed i expected more professionalism but it seems the delegates may well simply be voted in by peers rather than bystanders these daystheres nothing to support on this thread that isnt already supported by every single player of eve every time they log in
well saidremind me to buy you a drink when walk in stations gets completedo7
thats a lot of assumptions there but assuming they indeed do why arent they telling us why arent they posting progress reports about their pitched battle to defeat the lag monstereve atm is broken while they were well on their way of fixing it with apocrypha they can introduce fancy new stuff every few months all they want but its not helping the core game play any dominion was hauled in with a lot of pr as the patch that would make sovereignty what it always should have been yet it has only resulted in a lot of frustrated players wishing that server performance was as good as predom i had to ctrlq my titan yesterday morning to save it because the game was so ed upand lollerskates  the people who expect me to be super serial only because i carry a csm label im doing the exact same things i did before namely trying to make eve a better game only now i get to fly to iceland to tell it to their faceim not a smooth talking politician i wont wear a tie and i sure as hell wont pretend to be anything else than what i am for the sake of gaining supportdont like it dont vote for me sok
maybe you have never written a report but they take time and a knowledgeable person to write them so asking for volounteers for the test on sisi and the very occasional we are working on this is the way to go pretenting a regular report is the way to slow the resolution of the problem not the way to accelerate it
ironic you should say that dont like it dont vote for meas i said it looks like csm are voted in by their peers as opposed to bystanders these daysas mentioned though you cannot honestly expect ccp to write up a report once a week on their progress in battling the lag monster its firstly not feasible and secondly not sensiblethe community has a nasty habit of biting whichever community representatives from ccp come forth to do their job and present information in the ass repeatedly for no good reason because theyre spoiled little bratswhen they have to scramble their team of community heads to come and try to calm a situation down thats human resources that could have been spent doing far more important things than pacifying a bunch of childrenthat is why the csm are expected to be more professional that is why it doesnt help when a csm member is no different from a forum whinerthat is why if your kind of behaviour and level of professionalism is all it takes to be on the csm the csm might as well not exist because were all as good as csm then anywaywhile a member of the csm you are a representative of ccp not only the playerbase try to shape up a bit and act like onewhile were quoting the csm wiki page
i dunno its a rather severe problem so some sort of update system would be appreciated by yours trulyand to me that means not going full  trollingflaming people and not using your csm powers to gain an ingame advantage over others if you have general doubts about my sanity i invite you to check out some of my other contributions to the csm so far best place to start would be the minutes from past meetings
youre confusing sensibilityrationality with professionalismdecency nowedittrying to find proposalsissues raised by you now i come across this little gem
you are confusing professionalism and decency with being a smooth talking politician ill keep trying to make eve a better game in the same way that i did before its not like i could magically morph into barack obama upon election and i wouldnt want to eitheredit and that proposal was too specific as i noted in that thread we dont know the code so we cant blindly give detailed directions as to what they should do the overarching problem however persists and precisely because we as players cant be of much help there i request that ccp inform us better about the state of progress
which is exactly why im saying that youre no better than a fi whineryou are doing nothing in this thread but posting what countless people post on that forum category every single day and thats without even looking at the gd forum which is similarly overrun by a flood of threads whenever a system crashesccp is aware of the issue they dont need their time wasted by being reminded of the issue and having to sit in an official meeting where they could talk about things that they dont necessarily know about that are on the players minds  such as the proposals made in last weeks meetingas stated before giving frequent updates on whats being done is not feasible in part because this could give information to potential or existing shareholders that they should not necessarily be aware of that could sway their position as shareholders  in business practice some degree of opacity in company operations is a good thingthey are doing less damage to themselves by not giving the playerbase frequent updates than they would if they were tolook at it this wayif youre experiencing lag issues youll be the first to notice when theyre not there anymore would you really need a report to let you know this would knowing its coming a week before it does make it arrive sooner or would it simply cause you to be more aggravated if the changes end up making no noticeable difference the way they were promised to by ccpis any of this still an excuse for you to behave like a whining player as opposed to a representative of the community and intermediary between the players and the development teamsi only recently started browsing this forum category out of curiosity but have in the past seen traces of csm posts here and there and you are quite frankly in my opinion a very poor example for the csm
im a very poor example of csm in your book because you want to see slick smooth talking guys and i aint ever gonna be thati know they are aware of the issuesi know they are working on thembut i dont know whether they are aware of the huge frustration that it causes among the playerbase and the urgency many people feel about it im certain that if i asked around in corp the vast majority could care less about all the other promises and gimmicks they just want to see the game fixedand again id like to point you to things ive done in the past weeks serious business proposals et cetera but you seem rather focused on this one just because you dont see the urgency of it doesnt mean it deserves no attention we are here to help improve the game and woah this just seems like something that needs fixin
actually i went and had a read through at least the meeting minutes raw logi dont expect the csm to be smooth talkers i simply expect them to carry themselves with more professionalism than the average player because honestly i dont think i want someone that talks like a ninjasalvage whiner to be representing the views and concerns of the playerbase and i think a lot of other people will feel the same way in that regardthat is yet again why i said looks like the csm are voted in by their peers i didnt vote for the csm because i knew nothing about the candidates and was at the time far too busy to go and look at their general forum behaviour or their ability to be rational and neutral while at the same time carrying themselves with some degree of decencyyou are a poor candidate in my books because you refuse to treat the playerbase that you believe yourself to be representing with the level of respect they deserve why should their desires and needs to carried in your hands why was the proposal made to see if there are things that can be reducedremoved from the clientserver interactions thread too specific where your proposal is so ambiguous we might as well throw a banana at the server and see what the end result isyour opening post is summed up pretty much aswe were gonna have a fightthe system crashedccp fix itthat kind of crap should be limited to the endless threads that get locked in gd not this forum category worse than this is that your original thread title was proposal fix ur gamethe other guys thread could be summed up asi dont know what happens between the server and game butturning effects off on my side seems to help a bit with client lagif were gonna have them off anyway for huge fights cant the server not send us the associated infothat doesnt seem too specific to me in a sense as even if you dont know what happens in the background you could still bring the overall concept to the attention of ccp  namely that there may be aspects of the data sent to clients that they could choose to not receive even on a perperson basis to try and help with lag if you guys had to know exactly how the servers and clients work for you to bring up any suggestions there would likely be no csm as some of the most debated topics wouldnt be feasible for the csm to bring up namely those related to system sovereignty system performance indexes and similarly complex thingsanyway since were not going to see eye to eye on why it is that i dont like you ill ask you about what seems to be the core issue for you here detail what information ccp could potentially provide to the players with regards to combating lag is concerned give examples of what you think the potential playerside reactions and subsequent forum fallout might be whether good or bad news give examples of what you think the potential playerside reactions and subsequent forum fallout might be should promises made by ccp not be lived up to due to unforeseen consequences interruptions or failures detail what you think the process of writing up a report for the playerbase on at least a weekly basis would involve possibly include some timeframes and interemployee interaction timeframes involved in the process explain why you think its a good idea for them to do so explain why you might think it might not be a good idea for them to do soactually make a proposal here other thanfix ur gameorwe wants reports on lag combating giev nao
now were getting somewhere1 the players have concluded that lag has gotten a lot worse postdomi ccp could comment with possibilities why this is the case is it caused by anything obvious that changed with dominion2 players could give feedback on how fights in different circumstances sisi affected performance if the conclusion is that with presentday technology the whole if it simply cannot work then fine we need to adapt to it and adjust our expectations accordingly but ccp regularly makes claims in the media about the performance of their servers3 ccp promises us and delivers shiny new toys regularly  surely they have internally set goals for themselves about this situation that they can share with us if they are honest about their expectations and prospects then i dont4 weekly basis would be a whole lot and i dont think it would be wise to make it so rigid rather let us know when a milestone has been reached5 openness to the people that pay for their toilet paper there is a lot at stake for many people time effort spent significant amounts of real life money involved6 its their code and they can do whatever they want with it but if they want to make sure eve stays attractive for many among us then they need to address it the way it is now many people are frustrated and disappointed and i dont think it would be wise to ignore that only on the assumption that they are working on it i want to hear from ccp about it before trusting that they are on it
i like this ideaalthough the two things i see missing from pos life are better refine rates  the ability to repackage
sounds like a good idea alternatively a ore faction refinery array would be fine as well i guess
having a faster pc and reducing gfx settings has been confirmed to work in the past
thats having minimal effect if any at all with dominion 38ghz intel core i7 12gb ram 2x 1gb ati 4870s in xfire effects off turrets off no brackets and all graphics at lowest setting and loading grid is no faster nor no slower than loading it with effects on turrets on and graphics at maximum brackets though makes a difference
supportedsince communications between client and server is already necessarily bilateral i cant see why some kind of check cant be put in place it would definitely be worth the probably moderate amount of man hourswork of a small group of devs
this is an elegant  and logical sounding  solution well presented wish i knew if it would be difficult to implementsupported as a shortterm solution until the underlying issues are resolvedgreygal

i have so many problems with this idea its hard to tell where i should startyou sayif the index is low that is bad for market profitswhich is both right and wrong some items decrease in price some increase overall there would be more decrease then increase for the index to lower but that doesnt necessarily translate to low profits whens the best time to buy when the prices are lowest of coursethen latter you imply this index could be put in globally or regionally if the index was calculated regionally the first null sec alliance with 2 brain cells would immediately manipulate it since they can control access to their stations it wouldnt be hard soon you would have npc rats paying out 20 times more then they normally would or moreheres an excerpt from the opthat means that if the iskindex is low pos fuel rats missions etc will give less isk compared to a high iskindex which will give increased isk rewardsfor instanceskillbook worth 40mil iskindex of 106 actual book price of 424m isk00 bs rat worth 14m isk index of 094 actual rat value is 1316m iskin another place you suggest if the index is up rats should pay more this is like throwing gas on the fire if isk is the gas and inflation is the fire it would take a bad situation inflation and rapidly accelerate its effects what you should be suggesting is the opposite as inflation hits meaning the index goes up rats pay less at least this would slow down or even counter inflationas an inflationary tool its not needed ccp manages isk facetssinks fairly well

if your hmls are only reaching out to 90km i suggest that your skills need some work i get 80km in a drake you should looking at 120km in a rook which is p decent range for a cruiseras for your ecm well you could consider ecm range rigs are your ecm supports skills at level 1 or level 5 long distance jamming 5 and frequency modulation 4 will add a lot of ecm rangecome to that whats your recon ships skillcalling the rook an inferior ship is plain ignorant its an awesome ship
most skills are leve v and the others are level iv the rook was nerfed plain and simple it targets out to 180 as i said before and still no missiles or ecm go near that range
ccp has decided that electronic warfare should only be used at shortmid ranges so that you are in range of guns unless you jam everyone in the opposing gang

players clogging the petition queues are the issue not the petition queues gms being slow

not supported there are quite a few threads with much better ideas for fw1 this should be looked at but not dealt with in the way you suggest2 neutrals have nothing to do with fw and should be left completely alone its bad enough that they have a war raging around their ears there is no need to force them to do stuff they are neutral for a reason3 of course this is a major issue but suggestions would be more welcome then just saying fix it4 not really sure what you are saying here the lp store seems fine to me measured against other lp stores i think they are all a little frakked up but whatever5 what are you saying alliances should get to join if they are small enough or that corps over 75 shouldnt be allowed i think the rules for joining are fine or at least the most minor issue to do with fw if there is indeed a problem6 yes they do

as ive said breaking up the help channel into a possible 12 you havent said i was wrong about the number channels for players willing to sit there and field questions as well as any isd volunteer players and gms to now monitor is frankly ridiculous if you think it is bad now with people chatting and not answering questions imagine how it will be when there are no gms isds at all in there now there are times when there is a very minimal presence in the help channel and argumentschit chat can go on the solution is to ask your question as ive stated already and wait for an answer what you propose by breaking up the official monitored help channel into 12 npc help channels is to have them all unmonitoredunmoderated and that will also reduce the number of knowledgeable and willing players to answer questions all the time with 12 channels to pick from and monitor instead of just one there are 2 direct live help avenues you have in game your corp npc or pc the official help channel and if you cant find help there many other player channels exist as well as an insane amount of guides online here fan sites etc ive never had any problem finding the answer to my questions when i couldnt find it i asked and it only took me a few tries because i didnt ask a noob question that most people could answerweek old noobs should ask their question in the rookie help channel or that other channel that is open the npc corp channel or failing that do what anyone born in the last 20 years does naturally and search the web the official help channel is not there to ask noob questions that is why rookie channel exists do you expect the regulars to hold players hands who wont read the tutorials or try to figure things out for themselves when there are players whove done research on their question and need something cleared up this is a major reason for very short answers that or the answer is simple chat is not the place to explain aspects of eve to another player if you need that kind of help you need to do research on the gameread guides browse the forum have a private conversation or speak to one of your player corporation members so they can explain it to you explaining things in eve to people in chat just floods the channel with a one on one help session that few if anyone else cares about the official help channel is not the place to have long winded one on one sessions explaining this and that especially if it is something you should try to figure out on your owni have no clue what you had problems with or what you were asking help about but everything you are writing suggests what ive stated is correct as well as not understanding what you are really asking for the npc starter corporations are already an extra help channel for you there is no need to dismantle the official help channel to make more channels

me signs thisi dont fly caldari much but it must be said that only giving a damage bonus to one type of ammunition is kind of silly especially when missles only do one type of damage this means that a drake is best used when having kinetic ammo with this in mind it is well known that kinetic damage is normally one of the easiest to tank against because of the natural armour and shield bonuses to most ships in relation to kinetic resistances the problem you have with giving a damage bonus to caldari ships for all missles could be a caldari buff yes it is overdue probably and this should be changed but the bonus would make caldari ships alot more powerful now while most people argue that caldari ships arent that powerful i can quote a few ship setups and people who can prove you wrongwith high enough skills caldari deal alot of pain yes it doesnt have the refire rate of lets say autocannons or blasters but the damage when it finally hits is normally quite goodreference cerberus its the worst sniper hac because its not instant hit like guns but it deals alot of damage per volley
this should be balanced fairsigned
no support heres whytypically the other races cannot discard their damage bonuses in combat because projectiles are the only other weapons system that can change damage types compare with lasers or hybrids  those weapon systems are stuck doing 100 of their base damage types with missiles you can choose to do 100 of your base damage with kinetic missiles which is still the racial damage type i might add or you get the option of doing 80 of your nominal damage with any other damage type you choosetrust me if i had the option to fire pure explosive damage from lasers with 80 of base damage i would relish the flexibility it would provide and it would be a rather massive boost to lasers so asking to have not just this capability but to do 100 base damage with offdamage types is asking to have your cake and eat itbe happy that you have the bonus of not being tied to standard racial damage  rather than complaning that you have to make a small sacrifice to get this flexibility if youre changing damage in the first place youre obviously doing more damage even with the reduction than you would have done with kinetic ammo  remember that
if laser were made into a multi damage type weapons system  they would have there raw dps reducedwould you still be happy if you could select damage type but after a cut of maybe lets say 30 base dps be careful what you wish forif you look at the dps of acs to pulse or acs to blaster you will see that those weapons systems that cannot change damage type start off with more dpsthis is especially apparant and easier to compare with blasters  ac  lasers have supperior range profileslooking at the best small blaster versus best small ac for example youll see best small blasters start with 30 more dps with very similar range profiles and exactly the same trackingyour right it is good to be able to change damage typeits more than good  its pretty essential when solo in cmbsconsider that the best damage types to fire in most cirsumstances are emexp depending upon target a 5 per level boost to kinetic is not actually worth muchat level 5 cmb hull trainingif you consider an eanmd armor tanker for instance 5 kinetic would be worth around 15 dps against amarr base resists  about 5 against gall base resists and about 10 against minical base resists when your looking at performance of bonused kin over and above unbonused explooking at t1 shield tanksif em is patched then kinetic 5 offers a small increase over unbonused thermal  maybe 5 if em isnt patched then kinetic bonus is worthless over unbonused emoverall a 5 kinetic bonus is worth maybe 16 dps per player skill levelthat the problem with it  its a damage specific bonus to a weapons system that is designed and balanced as a weapons system that does multi damage typesmissiles dont start with huge dps  just like proj dont start with huge dpsit is a neccessary tactic to select a damage type that hits against a holeand lets be clear about this  if your target has a decent setup that hole is likelly to only be 20 lower than his best resist or lessif i were flying a cmbi should not be grateful that i have to fight without any kind of damage bonus just because i am using the tactics required of the weapons systemthe 5 kin bonus has been on cal ships from year dot as far as i knowmissiles have changed a lot since the 5 kin bonuses were introducedits time to take a good look at the 5 kin bonus in relaton to the current performance of missiles
okay we can argue all day and dodge the real issue hereyour core premise in your argument is thatcaldari missile boats with the 5 kinetic damage bonus are underpoweredplease demonstrate it
i think the biggest issue to me is that hybridslasers do 2 damage types projectiles it varies obviously but with a lot of caldari ships you are stuck with only 1 damage type or you lose all your bonuses that and the bonuses are not very streamlined because a few ships can shoot any missile of any type and retain bonuses but it seems like for some reason a lot of other caldari missile ships cant i just dont see the point i suppose if its good enough for the raven sac phoon ect it should be ok for the caracal drake cerberus ect none of those ships are really overpowered maybe cept the drake but i would just say its a good ship and one of the few viable caldari soloboats so nerf it if you must but its not like we have a whole wide range of selection really drake is about as easy as it gets and it get substantially more difficult after that to fit a tackle on a caldari shipswitching your ammo really shouldnt cost you your ship bonus and missiles could use the versatility considering how lacking they are right now yes i know they rock the pve but raven variants already dont lose dps swapping missiles who cares its a moot point
you do realize i have already won if your whole argument is caldari missile boats arent overpowered so its okay to boost them

1 irrelevant to you not to the people supporting this topicmy advice is go find a ship balance only thread if thats what your interested in and let those of us who are not so blinkered discuss bonuses if we wish to do so2 you know where  even if you care to ostrich your head in the sand about those finding by poring scorn on themmaybe not absolute proof but as ive stated allready  its up to the devs to get and analyse stats to see if theres an issue if this gets raised by the csm your requesting of onerous requirement on the op will not be successful in getting this thread closed or forgotten no matter how many times you repeat them
true acs have the lowest base dps out of all turret types however its not just a matter of selectable damage types they are also capless have by far the greatest falloff of all turrets especially with barrage and the greatest trackingin fact in many situations i would much rather have the extra range and engagement envelope of projectiles hardwired with barrage compared to equivalent blasters with a likeforlike weapon bonus in other words projectiles are competitive if not better regardless of their ability to change damage types in fact i do typically fit acs on a myrmidon for example rather than blasters and theyre almost always firing barrageif you consider an eanmd armor tanker for instance 5 kinetic would be worth around 15 dps against amarr base resists  about 5 against gall base resists and about 10 against minical base resists when your looking at performance of bonused kin over and above unbonused explooking at t1 shield tanksif em is patched then kinetic 5 offers a small increase over unbonused thermal  maybe 5 if em isnt patched then kinetic bonus is worthless over unbonused emoverall a 5 kinetic bonus is worth maybe 16 dps per player skill levelindeed the weapons system is designed and balanced around the ability to do multiple damage types and then the ships and their bonuses are balanced around the package as a whole thats where your argument falls flat the ships with kinetic damage bonuses are balanced against other equivalent shipsyou cant makes claims like the raven getting a rainbow damage bonus being a case for the drake getting it too for example as theyre two different ships balanced differently and appropriately the raven actually has less primary weapon hardpoints that the drakethey do do lower dps but missiles are capless are not crippled at all by tracking disruptors  hell are not crippled at all by tracking in fact theyll hit a target orbiting you at 500m better than they would if they orbited further out have further range than other weapons with their highdamage ammo hit toosmalltoofast targets for more damage than equivalent turrets would etcbesides if the hole is less than 20 then hey you never need to worry about changing and so the damage bonus is always working in your favour coolagain lets compare this to a laser ship attacking an armour tanker it may likely have a 25 bonus as well but against em and therm resists it will be taking a much larger damage loss than kineticexplosive wouldbasically i would love to fight without a damage bonus in this situation and use explosive as it would let me do about 50 more actual damage than being stuck with emtherm
i thought this thread would die but it refuses to do sothis is simply not true firstly you cannot compare the best small blaster to the best small autocannon without noting that their fitting requirements are vastly different about twice the requirements for the blaster youre much better off comparing the 200mm autocannon ii to the light electron blaster ii they have identical fitting requirementsits true that the blaster has higher damage with the highdamage ammunition antimatter charge s versus emp s but its 13 dps for the blaster and 11 dps for the autocannonthe optimal range is the same for both weapons with this ammunition 06 unbonused but the falloff range is vastly different  and with such short range the falloff value is immensely important the blaster hits 50 damage at approximately 1750 meters while the autocannon doesnt hit 50 damage until 4500 meters at 4500 meters the blaster is doing just about 0 damage if youve ever fought a closerange fight you know that this is not a similar range profileif the smaller amount of damage is because of anything it is because of this sheer range bonus but note the next pointusing the longest range ammunition iron charge s versus carbonized lead s shows very similar range results just add another 1300 meters to the numbers above however the base damage for both weapons using these munitions is exactly the same  clearly the autocannon is superior in this caseyoure analyzing a different game than the rest of us are your analysis doesnt have much to do with eve rather it has to do with you attempting to support your platform that the caldari should have the magical ability to choose damage typesthe weapon systems are designed to be different a missile launchers primary selling point is range and constant damage over that range a caracal can hit targets out to 126 km with level 5 skills or 110 km with level 4 skills that is its selling point not the ability to switch damage types its stuck with kinetic for a bonus so what no other t1 cruiser can hit out to that range for full damage a drake can hit targets out to 73 km with full damage again no battlecruiser can manage this feat without switching out for lower damage longer range munitions andor a variety of range increasing modules the penalty for this youre right kineticonly damage bonusthe sacrilege may have a rainbow damage bonus but its only bonused for heavy assault missiles and its stuck with the 17km range they offerif you want to switch damage types use a ship that is bonused for rof already dont switch out this bonus across the board willy nillyas has been said and as will continue to be said there may be problems with some ships but the bonus is not the problem  a blanket bonus change is certainly not the solution
the 5 kinetic bonuses were not balanced around the current incarnation of missiles5k bonuses were added to the ships  those that were in game  at the start of evethe 5k bonuses used to be ok on missile boats that allways hit for full damage  no matter the targets size or velocitythe 5k bonuses were shte back then but it hardle mattered as missiles were so opi remember frying a thorax in 2 volleys of fof cruise in my raven back in the daysnow missile have been fixed and rightly so as it was impossible to fly small ships back in those days and even think about tackling a cmb a ship class larger than what you were flyingbut at no point have the bonuses on cmbs been revisited since missiles have been altered its now important that missile boats have bonuses designed around current missiles not 2005 missiles
1 this is a ship balance thread2 where and yes it is your job to produce this information thats the whole point of this forum  someone identifies a problem proves that its a problem then proposes a solution you are proposing a boost to many ships you need to prove that these ships a are underpowered relative to their counterparts and b propose an appropriate solution you havent done anyway of this yet
it makes no sense to compare smallest blaster versus biggest acyou argument about fitting doesnt take into account the amount of resourses  gridcpucap  on the respective target shipsfitting best of all t2 usually leads to a situation where the fitting isnt possible without implants or usage of some sort of meta 4 modit is sensible to compare largest size to largest size  or smallest to smallesttheres no magic involved  mini do it day in day out with full bonuses to all range is great v npc but against players is ofzero value sololittle value in small gangs worthless in fleets due to flight timelisten to what you are saying the bonus you train for is your penaltyyour right it feels like that flying cmbsno the problem with cmbs is there bonus8 more dps  average  for training lvl5does not compete with25 more dps  avergae  for training lvl5improving the bonus on cmbs is the solution
1 this is not a ship balance threadship balance would be altered theres no dought about thatbut this thread considers more aspect of play than mearly ship v ship balancethe purpose of this thread it to highlight the contradictory nature of  cmb bonuses awarded for ship hull training  and  caldari combat tactics damage type switching2 directly after the first time you asked for it  page 5  6  are you an evebay account or do you have the memory of a goldfish 2a you yourself have agreed that many of the ships are up why is further debate on this required you want me to convince you of a fact to which you allready agree we may differ on the reasons why cmb xyz is underpowered but the fact that they are in need of help is not in question2b this thread is the appropriate solutionraise the value of the cmbs bonus to be equal to 25 dps at level 5
or change it to 10kinetic dmglvl for the loss of bonuses for other dmg types
they could use a pvp boost the current mechanics of how missiles apply damage justifies it in my opinion

who doesnt watch tv while running missions seriously though have you heard of the darpa challenge yet the uber robots of the future have only 4 commands plus they will happily orbit their command ship without defending it but can be told to defend someone else in a fleet lol  the poor gallente pilots and their nonfunctional tools of war

supported this is a remarkebly fair way for it to go as it stands the salvage profession is by far the best starting career path while still learning the game for any new player and will teach them skills that theyll use later in eve too
not supported  too many asshats blundering into missions already
no reason not to
not supported you wont be able to tell whether or not the wreck is abandoned and the mission runner doesnt want it anyways so chances are it would just be an easier way to ninja it wont ease the relationship any it may even make it worse by making it easier to scan down lower level sites as well as hard to scan ships plus it lets the ninja know when the missioner is gone to his salvage alt giving him no chance to choose to respond at allid rather see tools that make salvaging nonconfrontational and help the mission runner if we could salvage for them and get a cut while saving them time theres be a much better relationship we need to be able to offer services as well maybe salvaging contracts could be offered or some way of erecting a salvage container a neutral can dump stuff in and get instant payment making it easier to ninja though will not help
i always found it odd that wrecks werent probeable this would also give access to wrecks that arent necessarily mission generated which would be nice if the type of wreck smalllarge elite etc was kept secret until landing it would help keep things balanced as well
when a mission runner abandons a wreck it becomes blue with the last patch a way to drag salvagers to these wrecks would be increasing the signature together with that thus making adandoned wrecks easier to scan down than those who are not abandoned should be covered by making deadspace covering the signature of wrecks thus making them more difficult to scan them down that is a social problem not a technical one and salvage was not meant to help the mission runner as stated by ccpfurther you already can make bookmarks of containers respectively wreck fields and contract them something to further strengthen this might be the option display the age of contracted bookmarks and their destination systems so the buyer of those bookmarks can see if he is within the 2hour despawn time and if the system is somewhat close to him
definitely in support of this one especially the idea of making deep space probes need astrometrics iii and combat scanners to need v i mean really between the fact that scanning down someone actively trying not to get found ought conceivably be harder than scanning down a massive anomaly and the fact that deep space probes are a lot less useful than they were when initially implementedwell anyway yea on both counts wrecks scanable and all for all the above stated pros
i have no problems with that and would support it if it were limited to abandoned wrecks but you have to ask how many people will abandon them ive done belt salvage and most of the wrecks i come across are yellow despite people being long gone and not coming back same with militia gate salvage despite t1 wrecks not even worth the time to salvage for them not really unless you make it so difficult as to be prohibitive in which case it would be useless see above uh whats the point then if salvage is only designed to work one way currently its a onesided propositiona ninja salvager enriches himself with tools both people can come out handily and maybe we wont have such rancor and salvagers wont be seen as rats and thieves so muchif you are going to suggest a kludge like contracting bookmarks why not just formalize it with a real salvage contract and make it less hassle stuff like this is just trying to use salvagers to act as a nerf to hisec mission runners and its annoying if ccp wants to nerf them have the guts and do so dont put players in the position to do it

and you read the math about the uselessness of passive recharge except for passive fitsin worst case we can use this compromise
how is this remotely related to the question at handthe problem shield tanked ships are not being used in fleet pvp the reasons are clear and stated above are you telling me the extra 5 or 6 dps per second that a shield tanked ship with a bonus gets bugs you do you realize the resist bonus that armor gets far surpasses this in terms of tankaside from all that if that is really the issue we have an option to remove the extra passive recharge bonus the amount is so small as to be truly laughable anyway

i have edited the wiki article to reflect the change and will reraise the proposal
i really think the big problem is the session change issue  it resets every time you change sessions basically if it was instantly applied like armor armor tanks would have a lesser bonus than shield tanks as it is shield tanks have a lesser worthless in many situations bonus than armor tanks really it is a useless bonus for anything but drakes when going directly into a fight gatebridgeundock for everything else it is only useful in a campreset the bonus for pilots below a a newly promoted fc wc sc  not every time the fleet moves
as this is part of the datacleanup section of the proposal it is definitely up for debate i was only trying to bring a newlytransfered char as close to a newlycreated one as possible i understand that for isklaundering purposes your wallet history may mot be deletable but the rest in my opinion could be wiped the more important part of this proposal and the only part i care if it survives or not is the first part about roledropping and an employment history entry for character sold i think those are the important aspects of this proposal the others are just nicetiesoh and shamelessly supporting my proposal

thats all good ideas actually i like that might be abit disturbing sometimes for ewar but the web and scram are definatly necessary sparks for overheated huns although that might take it a bit overboard but yeah effects for ewar woul be real cool lets get vivid indications of ewar
would it be nice yes but it really would only would be for asthetic appeal well and the ability to poke fun at the guy who didnt fit a tracking booster of some kind and cant hit anything this would be a good visual upgrade but not very important i mean we are living with missiles launched from inside a ship that fly through the target ship to hit a window on the other side of it planets that ships warp though ships that warp sideways guns that supposedly have slow tracking that quickly spin when the target is changed hilarious to watch by the way the classic everyone undocks inside of each other as well as the ball of ships that is a fleet there are aesthetic changes that can be done many many aesthetic changes yes right now anything to improve fleet fights is a good thing in my opinion especially if they could look less like a big disco ball and more like a battle watch dreads in action sometime if you need a good epileptic shock long have missile users complained about this most have given up hope it would be nice though in a large fleet fight it would be nice to have something letting you know you are not able to warp people have pointed to the overview on the side however most of the ships are often not displayed here  some are turned off because you arent going to shoot them but also because there are simply hundreds of ships in that massive scrolling list meh bigger thruster flare for ab and a blur effect for mwd would be pretty it would also be sort of helpful in small engagementswaaaaaaaaaaaaaay down the list of things that need to be taken care of in the game
id like to see the items you can get for your pirate lp given a bit of a polish correct me if im wrong but im pretty sure you can get blueprints for caldari navy bcs from the caldari lp store but the only way to get the guristas equivalent is to kill faction guristas which is the opposite of what id like to doim not suggesting we go and put officer mods up for purchase in the store although you should do that but currently the lp stores feel like a carbon copy of any generic empire corp with pirate bpcs and pirate implants added remove the nonpirate implants and other generic stuff and add some more piratey thingsim enjoying my pirate related standings grind at the moment and id love to be able to lose more pirate themed gimmick ships without paying an incredible amount of money to do so im happy with paying a lot of lp to do so because my time is free tldr  add pirate faction item bpcs to the store and remove all the generic empire items which you can get from any empire store if i want a 3 mining implant ill import one
yarrcurrently its really only profitable to get pirate implants or ships from the pirate lp storesmore variety in terms of modules would definitely be welcomedsupported
i was a good little missioning pilot once upon a time now i have a noticeable chunk of lp with thukkers with nothing but random fairly boring implants to burn it on i ran drugs and killed empire navy ships and they are offering mining implants reallyat some point there had been talk about improving the lp stores for the pirate factions so i didnt use it even after the fix that happened a year ago the stores are still very bland when compared to empire stores i agree with the op the pirate stores need love
although im no pirate mission runner i would agree with this one  there should be some kind of benefit from choosing to side with pirarrtes besides the epeen of renamed implants

very much a good idea
before in the old long probing system i would be against this in this new probing system when you can get a 100 hit within 5 seconds if you do your homework i am totally for it i mean seriously your scanner picks up the result anyway and somehow with all the defensive and automated technology available on your ship you have to manually find the result in the list that can mean life or death dang if i was making a scanner id make it refresh automatically and sound an alarm when it detects a probe but we wont go that far for game play mechanics sakesjust make probes filterable in the result window 
i support this lowsec missioners in systems with more small this or small that or that start with a letter after s should not have a disadvantage

so what happens next how do you move from idea with mostly thumbs up support to something the csm will actually talk about
welcome to my worldthere are items that have hundreds upon hundreds of supports not all of them are imho legit and they never get carried forward or discussed or ccp shuts them downthis particular area is where you attempt to bring ideas forth not necessarily succeedso patience is a key here
the autoinject idea is about the most meritorious ive seen yetif the prereqs are in que and will enable the use of a skill you should be able to select it to inject when the que gets to that point the skillbook is locked down grayed and untouchable until the que is available to inject itthe only caveat would be that the book would either have to be in the cargohold of the currently active ship or the person would have to be docked at the station that they have the book at in their hangar that to prevent injecting a book while 40 jumps away unless theres a skill to enable it like scientific networking or similar skills

theres a proposal that relates to this its about gang bonus effects on shield tanked ships i think this issue is just one of many regarding the overall issue of shield vs armor feasibility as it stands now i believe shield tanks have more disadvantages then advantages compared to armor tanking shield tanking is not a viable option in fleet and this is demonstrated daily by the ratio of armor tanked ships vs shield tanked ships you see in combat on a regular basisthis proposal is to have csm and perhaps ccp look at the overall picture and propose rebalancing changes with the intention of making armor and shield tanking comparably worthwhile overalljust two issues that should come upshield rr fitting costs ridiculously out of lineshields not receiving an ehp increase when gang bonuses are applied give your support to a reevaluation of the two tank types on a whole add any issues you feel that are unbalanced with either tank type as the mechanic stands now
not supported overall the balance is ok
have you ever gone up against a drake or a ubertanked ravenif you have youd be questioning this proposalnot supported
shield tanking in general is fine shield transporters and gang bonusses are an issue though
ive used both im not suggesting shields are horribly broken and never used im saying there are enough broken aspects to discourage use of shield ships especially in fleeted pvptake the last 10 fleet fights you were in altogether did shield tanked ships make up even close to 50 of the ships used total from my experience not even close if to fix whats unbalanced means reexamining the overall balance then i say thats the way to go its not my intent to limit this to shields this is not a buff shields thread this is an effort to identify any issues that exist with either systemsupported because an overall reexamination is better then fixing one flaw at a time which if done is more likely to cause other unbalancing issues
thisshield rr is pretty evenly matched with armor tbh it is just a case of there are only a few fleet compositions where shield rr tanks would fit better than armor rr due to so many ships with so few mid slotsshield tanks arent used in bs fleets partly because shield rr is the lesser option partly because armor provides a better buffer but also because most of the good fleet pvp ships in the game are naturally armor tanked it makes sense to have a fleet uniformly tanked because rr is significantly better than local tanking
fair enough i suppose it needs to be looked into cautionary support
it could be nice to see the all dominant armor tanking not be so all dominant in pvpabove casual support
i have raised the issue for next meeting 24th and created a wiki page to support it
the current implementation of sov warfare has attempted to narrow the focus of fights to the sovereignty modules outpost if present and the sbus the poss are gone but the reinforcement timers are still here with a vengeance the sov modules have 3 timers they have such little variance that the aggressors schedule is completely controlled by ccp and the defender this leaves the aggressor with almost no initiative once the process starts you must follow the recipe or give up this formula leaves a bad taste to counter the horrible mechanics the aggressor must attempt to outblob the defenders perhaps this was ccps intent lets have massive fleet battles sadly even with reinforced processing nodes they have been crashing consistentlyto sum it up change the rf timer variance such that it is dramatically wider than it is today and random no one likes to have the game control your schedule increase the ehp on the sbus they are too easily destroyed if the sbus have more survivability then the aggressors will have more flexibility alternatively tie all the deployed sbus together such that to destroy them all must be attacked together or in succession before a single one offlines this is effectively adding survivability to the sbus and the associated flexibility to the aggressor lag node crashing this is a technical hurdle that i am sure that ccp is already investing in what i would like to see is periodic updatesbiweekly on the status of this issue a major aspect of game play is effectively crippled at this time the fraction of the player base who is interested in this needs to know whats going on in order to plan accordinglythanks in advance for your considerationbbb
what you should have said is no one likes to have the defenders control your schedule  because what youve just proposed is exactly that the game randomly decides what time you have to get out of bed to defend your spacei agree that the nodes crashing is wearing a bit thin given that there are actually enjoyable fights happening but random timers makes everyone unhappy whereas defender chosen timers makes only the attackers unhappy
while it may be better than current situation i agree that large variation in random timer is unwanted system is still broken when you have to reinforce it several times until random number generator returns something that is favourable for you
timezone warfare should be abolished double or triple the random factor presently associated with reinforcement timers and be done with iteve is war once turtling is a guarantee for success it becomes my little hippo in space lag occurs after every patch latest one introduced blobfriendly war mechanics so effects are multiplied it will get sorted in due time as it always is
you raise some valid points especially on exploitation in 00theres a number of ways you could fix this let the index be based around the amounts actually transferring the market or being soldessentially it would still be possible to create a high index but this would assume that people didnt buy stuff from the market in the entire region or at least is decisive to pay 20x empire price for itif they instead decide to import items from highsec to seed on their own market they would effectively increase the demand in highsec thus effectively decreasing supply which normally leads to increased prices whether these pricechanges would actually effect the economy of highsec i cannot saydoing this also has another benefit depending on pov 00 would in average have a much higher income potential than empirethe problem would be that the static outcome would remain about the same to my knowledge npc items are not seeded in 00 stationsas i see it theres practically only 2 static isk sinks in 00 market taxes pos fueli dont include blowing ships upmarket taxes increasing by say 20times would make sense while pos fuel increase by 20 times wouldnt lorewise this could be explained however that the pos workers  would want more stuff gameplay wise makes sense lore nopeessentially my idea was to create an eve that would really feel like a true market on all aspects and balance out the game a little iskwise since eve practically runs on isk

more industrial missions and less go there and shoot stuff missionsthis would be an absolutely great idea i support this
indeed
i agree not only do the storylines need to match the missions you are running we need more variety overall in storylines im soooooo sick of materials for warsupportedgreygal
weepsplease please for the love of  beer
in a game without grinding we have missions that are as tedious as grinding in any other game the new epic arc missions are a step in the right direction but still fall shortif the missions arent going to be more engaging at least let them be less grinding combat missions should lead to combat storylines just as hauling missions should lead to hauling storylines in fact there are a dozen different types of agents this would be fine if the missions were engaging and felt unified in some way as it is it just makes missions more grinding
suicide ganking can currently be done essentially for free using disposable trial account alts and insurable ships in fact it is arguably quite easy to negate the security status penalty with regular mission running especially when you compare it to the time it may take the victim to recover from the loss this goes against the whole consequences for your actions paradigm and throws risk vs reward concept completely out of the windowi propose the following changes to make it more balanced for trial accounts disable the ability to aggress players that arent flagged towards them for regular accounts disable the ability to recycle characters with negative security status remove insurance payouts for ships destroyed by concord adjust the security status penalties based on the victims ship class destroying a mining x007fvessel or a hauler should result in much higher penalty than destroying a combat ship
trial piratesplease noterrible ideagood idea although this has already been suggested many many times before no this doesnt even make sense you should be punished more for shooting at newbs this is eve remembersorry i cant support this
just the opposite being a pirate should have its consequences like being restricted to low security space trial accounts are an easy way to bypass this and therefore should not be able to pirateactually it is already a petitionable exploit to recycle a suicide ganking character withot gms permission but its hardly ever enforced because nobody knows about ityou should be punished more for shooting ships that cant shoot back if you are shooting miners and haulers you obviously want to be a pirate  and pirates belong in lownullsec and eve is not all about shooting newbs you know
perhaps an easier way to implement the intent of the no recycling negative sec status characterswhich is silly because being negative status itself shouldnt ever be penalised outside gameplay idea would be to say no recycling characters within a month of being concordedbut that said im still a bit iffy on this idea
this is against the eula anyway i know some of my friends got warnings for it theres a way around it however using buddy program1  sent urself buddy invite2  spend 14 days training for thrasher w 3 chars3  activate account with plex4  main account gets 30 free days5  use the 3 chars for ganking6  repeatie you get the second account for a month paying for it instead of your main thus essentially freethis is not against the eula though recycling characters for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of a negative sec status is
cba to edit quotes1 being restricted to lowsec and not being able to shoot at people who havent agressed you is two completely different thingsi fail to see your point here though  you want suicide gankers out of highsec or whati can understand the costbenefit of sgank insurance but other than that no2 as tianla suggested 30 days of from getting concordd would prevent this pretty much3 in eve you care about what you have and perhaps corp and allianceif you lose isk thats a problem for you if other people gain or lose isk  why should you careso you would just want all combat ships in lowsec00 and all miners could then mine veldspar in highsec9000 hitting the wallet of suicide gankers is fine with me restricting what they can do is not except from them getting gibbed by c when they enter highsec
if you get concordokken you should only receive a 50 insurance payout thats probably all that really needs to happen and the rest would start to selfcorrectits just enough of a penalty that it would dissuade many if not the majority of alt recyclers and would still give new players who accidentally blow themselves up enough compensation to recover and still learn about eves loss consequences careful with that smartbomb eugeneotherwise make tech ii ship insurance inline with tech i if you want balance suicide gankers can still get their highsec jollies but less players would likely ragequit because they could at least buy adequate insurance as an optiondefense
pretty much yeah
actually it is already a petitionable exploit to recycle a suicide ganking character withot gms permission but its hardly ever enforced because nobody knows about it just how often do you see someone do this since you cant watch their account imo this should be implimented or the delete a character with negative sec status process should require a gms approval before you can do this  petionable exploit means its not going to get noticed most of the time because nobody will see it when it happens the huge majority of the time
not supportedsuicide ganking is currently balancedthe only reason ganking is free now is because miners and mrs are selling their minerals too cheap if they would simply raise the price of minerals above the insurance floor ganking would become more expensive  and less common like it was oh 6 months ago  before trit values crashed really the power is in their hands alreadyno need to rely on ccp to stack the insurance system which removes all ganking risk from the miners and places it squarely on the haulers
please stop spraying that useless bullcrap aroundyou and i know that is the biggest pile of garbage weve ever heardit was funny the first dozen times and now its just out of handyour just covering up the fact you dont want to lose your precious insurance when you get concorddmineral prices are crashing its not as profitable as it used to be to mine in high sec so your argument is totally bogusthats why i moved out to null sec better minerals means more profitnow i dont agree with this proposal but i whole heartedly agree that insurance should not be paid when you get concordd or self destructyou can suicide gank all you want but no more free ships you want to come after me i want to know your paying for itsec status isnt good enough of a cost its all to easy to grind upyou want to impact the market go gank mission runners oh wait you wont too expensive and they just might shoot backpoor poor baby
slight changeremove insurance for concord bbq unless the pilot you shot at is in your gang so just in case you accidentally hit the railgun instead of the remote repper in your mixedcorp or alliance unless theyve repaired that fleet youll get your payouti dont imagine that people will accept random gang invites it happens yeah very often so that solves the suicide gank issue without breaking the insurance system in generally legitimate casesi like the idea of not being able to recycle characters that have received more than 1 concord loss in the last 30 days 1 is understandable 10 is not perhaps if the character is less than 90 days old and 5 due to direct concord action they should not be recyclable at all until their sec status is returned to zero lowering sec status in 04 or below should not carry this penaltythatll kick the alt recycling revolving door squarely in the gonads wont slow down those exploiting the plex system however
drakenah youre only covering up the fact that your thick monkey cranium doesnt understand economics fact eight or nine months ago there were far fewer complaints about suicide gankingccp had already nerfed it after all but since thensomething changedfact insurance hasnt changed in years its not like insurance was changed by ccp in the last patch and suddenly suicide ganking became a problem something else must have changedhmmmmfact suicide ganking is cheap because minerals thus t1 ships are cheapand minerals are cheap because miners and mrs choose to sell them to us cheap its their choice as they are the ones that push the sell button they willingly hand a loaded gun cheap t1 ships to those who would destroy them gankers not smart but thats carebears for youfact if mineral prices go up suicide ganking becomes less common its quite easy to understand  more expensive t1 ships  more isk cost to ganking  less people do it and less forum whiningif you think cheap ganking is a problem the best way to solve it is to drive mineral prices up so it because expensive ganking lots of ways to do that but really its not my concern if miners and mrs insist on selling their labor for pennies im not going to stop them oh yeah  not supported again
how about true facts1 fact eight or nine months ago there were still a lot of complainers about suicide ganking its about as old as eve is alive 2 insurance hasnt changed you are correct however nothing else related to suicide ganking has changed besides concords reaction3 uhh yeah this is due to supply vs demand currently the demand is that minerals are cheap this is basic economics you want to sell high go right ahead youll get a lot more people willing to undercut you 4 mineral prices going up will not change suicide ganking quit trying to be an economist because you have no real idea how gankers are doing this
1 yes there were complainers then too  some will complain until suicide ganking disappears entirely read close  i said less complaining then i win 1 for me2 apparently you agree with me here insurance hasnt changed eves playerbase hasnt radically changed  the increase in ganking can thus only be attributed to cheaper t1 ships 2 for me3 duh of course its supply and demand huge supply weak demand  cheap mins the point i was making way too many minerals out there suicide ganking both increases demand and reduces supply its a winwin ccp should be encouraging more of it  not nerfing it making life easier for carebears only means even more minerals than the current glut we have now 3 for me4 i am a ganker i know how gankers are doing itremoving insurance would do precisely nothing to dessiegang gankers solo bcbs gankers however would no longer be able to target miners as the cost would be too high after all hulks only drop about 58m isk in mods only haulers would be valid targets 4 for mesorry to say butyou lose
since you claim to be such an expert why dont you go try to mine for a month and then come back here and tell me what you believe to be so trueput your money where your mouth is hot shotoh and make sure your mining near a major mission hubmarket hub smarty pantslets make this a real clear lesson as to why this is continuing to be a problem for industrialistsfurthermore dont even bother insuring your suicide ganking ships
sooooi should start mining and become part of the problem much better that i gank and be part of the solutionsecond i have a mining alt he flies a hulkorca but i dont mine much anymore because trit prices have crashed never been ganked because i know exactly how ganking works and how to maximize ehp lowslotsrigs  not just for cargoexpanders and minimize risk um stay aligned stay atkduring hulkaggedon i mined for a few hours in a covetor just to see if id get attackedand i didntthird as far as putting my money where my mouth is  you dont want to go there son ive lost more isk to suicide ganking in 12 months than youve probably ever seen as in multiple freighters loaded blown up in uedama of course i differ from you in that i dont whine about it  i consider it the cost of doing business and take precautions to reduce the chance of it happening the next time
the bold print says mountainsas for the 3rd point yeah rightand i aint your son pops
nice thing about gccs  give you 15 minutes for postingtrit prices crashed  so i choose not to minedoesnt mean as much as you think kidwhen trit was around 420unit it was worth it to mine once in awhile if i felt really lazy at 250unit  id rather spend more time driving freighters and adjusting trade orders rational behavior  but you wouldnt know much about that now would youhighsec mins price crash omg mine more veld is not smart play but that is exactly what is happeningmineral prices are driven straight down to the floor because of too many minersmrs its not something that is happening to them they are simply doing it to themselvesyep ive lost far more than you will ever have not that losing freighters to suicide ganks is something to be proud of but safe to say ive been on both sides of the equation
yeah this is a clearly missing feature when im setting up an alt to do a particular job and not train indefinitely being able to turn their training on and off at need without wasting time is something i really wish for but that i cant practically do at present similarly the ability to pause training on a different character on the same account would make multicharacter training work much more cleanly supported
so i posted this in the future ideas sub section and i was told to look for a similar thread in this section im lazy so i thought id just post this fresh in here as told by mei like i believe most players do will often dump a lot of loot in home station to run more missions faster then sell all the loot once often times when faced with too much loot to sell one will reprocess everything and sell the remaining ore this is a bit contrary to the idea of making money as sometimes you refine something that was worth a lot more isk then the material it refined for my suggestion is this when we view our assets either on the items screen or the assets screen can you add a tab that will show the meta level of an item similar to the quantity tab i feel this would eliminate a lot of heartache associated with selling loot thank you for your timeyeah
somewhere somebody already requested a sort by meta level and apparently ccp said yes so dunno if this proposal is necessary
i want this
i love the rook just the way it is long targeting range means i can deal with serpentis at maximum range
after recently being thrust into the laggy events that is 00 sov i wish to reopen the subject about local chatit is marmite you love or hate it and there is alot of suggestions to change it before i made this thread i did try to read most of the local changes threads to see if i was repeating an idea but i could not find ithere is my suggestionwhen a 00 alliance decides to join up with other alliances to take sov of another system the amount of people in local normally sticks at around 200 and then fluxuates from 501000 over time depending on the actions taken in nearby systems or in that that system with 1000 people in a system no one really needs local chat any more any logistical benefits of local are rendered utterly useless any chat options used in local are merely for spam messing up the server insults or general useless garbage that people spurt because they simply can my proposal is to limit local maybe depending on average players in system so that when the system does get to 400 people you are unable to talk in localthe only disadvantage to this would be the high sec hub systems like jita however those systems can be excluded from the limitation because there is always a use for local in high sec space 00 space however local is only used for intel gathering if there is anything worth saying in 00 it is done behind closed doors with diplomats private chats or the likethe benefits with the limitation you dont have to worry about absolute and total garbage spam into local administrators would not be called on so regularily to check the local chat to make sure there is no violations of policies the even of sending everyone in a 1000 strong system the same litter of garbage would no doubt effect the server even if it is a small amount next to say drones every little helps when it comes to 00 i think everyone can say that any way to reduce lag from large fleet fights in 00 without having to tell ccp when youre going to do it how youre going to do it the numbers involved the time and what you had for breakfast is a good thingi currently know no reason for local chat to be used in a large scale fight situation or even just a large amount of people in 00 space the downsides you are unable to spam funny or obscene links in local you are unable to say funny comments or insult others in local during large scale operations or high numbers of people in localthe list of downsides goes on but the idea is roughly the samethoughts
this pleasei think if i have to goa log an alt and hunt down a bunch of omberb chase around the market for some and spend ages tracking it down via unsorted deliveries uii think ill just hang myself 
i dont think this was brought up on the 17th so could someone raise it even it is just under any other business aob the experimental gallente storyline missions which are causing huge problems for gallente missions runners it essentially makes us gank bait in low sec and fw systems and makes raising faction tedious to impossible especially if you get one of these badly thought out storylines 4 times in a row eg after running 64 normal missionsthe assembly hall proposal is here
all storyline missions are abysmally badly implemented and executedthere are not enough of them variety wise compared to standard missions they always seem 100 opposite to the type of agent the pilot is currently using combat mission runners get hauling missions materials for war is a slap in the face waste of effort minimal standings gain and it comes up 999 of the time for all of my mission running chars while noncombat mission runners tend to get combat mission storylinesand theyre just flat out stupid seeming to have no bearing or relation at all on the faction that the pilot is working for the minmatar materials for war mission is 100 identical to the amarr or gallentein closing the mission design team in atlanta needs to get off their collective asses and put some thought variety and depth into these imporant missions

just have it as a rightclick on drones in bay and have it consume electrical and mechanical parts yeah boththis should only apply to fighters and fighter bombers not any other drones

a larger value might be a solution alsoit would be largelly equiv to 5 rof in averaged out valueit would solve the averaged out dps complait about the 5 kinit would solve the issues with noobs doing equal damage as wellit would solve the tactics issue as well as cmbrs could just stick with kinmini t2 might get somewhat butchered though and armor tankers would probably start crying as wellon a somewhat related point  it seems even the devs understand some of the issues with the kin bonusif you look at the t3 damage subsystems for strat crusierswhere the gun boats get 10 dps per level bonusesthe tengu gets75 em75 therm128 kinetic  1075  105 75 expper levelsomething like375 em375 therm65 kin375 expper levelcould work in place of the 5 kin on t1 hullskeeps the kinetic flavour  whilst still being equal in value to 5rof
1 this is a ship balance thread you propose boosting certain ships  you must therefore believe that those ships are underpowered relative to their competitors and require boosting the current nature of the kinetic bonus simply means that no investment of sp is required for the pilot to deal the damage around which the ships are balanced i dont see why you would introduce the requirement to train the skill to v to gain the dps output around which the ship is balanced unless you wanted to change that damage output  and changing ship combat capability is a ship balance issue im afraid that theres nothing more to it and this thread will garner no serious support until you appreciate this ask yourself  why has a csm member not supported this thread2 show me just copy and paste the appropriate post in here or link to the thread in question i dont see why youre so reticent to do such a simple task
there is no point in discussing with davhe keeps reposting his arguments as absolute truth even after they have been shown to be flawed likewise he conveniently ignores the good arguments made against is proposal much like a fanatic he shows no culture of debate
against the arguments given are so tuned in favor of the idea i cant support itif this would happen minmatar would revolt against their falloff gallente against their drones that can be shot and amarr against their caphungryguns and wasted capbonuses on shipsat least they could ask dav to write them some onesided charts and statistics about the problems
not unless it comes with variable damage type hybrids and lasers otherwise this proposal is way overpowered
so many noobs here who have absolutly no idea about balanceis it that hard to understand that missiles were designed with fully changeable dmg type in mind and kinetic only takes this bonus awaymaking caldari missile ships with kinetic bonuses weakalso if those ships are balanced at lvl1 vs other races ships at lvl1  then at lvl5 kinetic bonused ships are weaker than other races ships at lvl5also i see much less missile ships except drake which is good only because of its tank and fitting ability than turret ships only a few cerberus because caldari can bring this or the even more sucky eagle at sniper hac ops
thats because my arguments are absolute truthwhats more you know they are correctif a 5kin bonus was not a weaker bonus than a 5rof bonus  nobody would be objecting so stronglyso against arguments generally break down to  yeah the 5 bonus is rubish but its ok because its caldari and caldari having a bonus that equal to other races would make caldari overpoweredcaldari ships are not overpowered or even in balance with other ships atmeven some of the detractors in this post can see thiswhy people have such a tough time putting it together is beyond meall races training should be equally valuableall races should get use full use of there damage bonus where ships get damage bonusesbonuses should not clash with tacticsif some ships become op they can always be tweaked afterwardsthe only ship i can see possible being an issue is the drake because it has the great 5 per level resists bonusso maybe the drake gets something else instead of rofdpl
not supported as a caldari missile user my kinetic bonused caracals and drakes can already own missions at their respective levels without effortedit nvm ill support this topic as it will make my ships more powerful
at least you were honest unlike most of the people here
missions anyway ishtar  cerb for every missionor you could use the nighthawk which is good in pve but very weak in pvp anyway it is still only mission not those cant be done with any other races as good as caldari can
aineko speaks the truthyour arguments are not absolute truth face it its obviously a weaker bonus nobody is denying thatbut that doesnt mean that a rof bonus is in order that would be unfair to other races and completely unnecessarysome caldari ships are rubbish because of ship problems or because of missile problems not because of bonus problems look at the missiles or the ships construction not the bonus bonus is fineby your logic i should be arguing this point gallente blasters should be the highest dps weapons in the game so instead of 5 damage or rof per level i should get 15 damage or rof per level otherwise its not fair blasters dont do enough damage we get same bonus as everybody else
alternatively what about a complete revamp of caldari ships to balance them out p
that would be good
yes because this is totally a how can i increase my iskhr running level 3 missions in a drake thread you nailed it champ

sounds like fun
i can support this yeah one point though  youre wrong about scan probes deep space probes are an expanded version of combat probes not of core and as such the skill requirements are perfectly in line with where they should be
eves use of fonts is among the worst ive ever seen in any game the fixed tiny font size bothers me at timesand im 24 and 2020 the lookalike lettersli o0 6g etc are ridiculous and its just generally unattractive this isnt the only thing that needs fixing but its certainly one of them
yes please the fonts are way to small for older people and options to make them bigger are not enough
my girlfriend couldnt play eve on her projector because the fonts were too damn small add options for larger fonts
i would suggest not only allowing larger fonts but also to revisit the entire font choice as it stands identical lettersnumbers is sometimes an issue was it a capital o or was it zero at least in chat an option should be given to allow us to chose a font we are most comfortable with
good idea bad implementationplease keep the flavor text folk away from game design and balancethey dont know wtf theyre doing
i will support this as i dont think it will do anything to further its alleged aim of introducing pvers to fwpvp then again for most pvers all the isk in china wouldnt be enoughhowever i would like to tell the op that calling for the dev teams sacking over this minor  up is frankly ridiculous and demonstrates quite a shocking level of ignorance over what ishas been occurring in the rest of the game your pompous self important carebear obsessed rant made me lol so much that i almost did not support the topic i mean really hold an investigation into why ccp had the audacity to even think about doing this to the almighty carebear population  oh the horror  someone call the un at once
also are you by any chance an alt of a ed of main who has been killed by bellum eternus real coincidence with ur name if not
kudos to the last 2 posts it would be unfortunate if this proposal got lost behind walls of ranttextthese storylines are an experiment a badly designed poorly implemented experimentheres hoping that both ccp and our representatives on the csm can filter out the background to focus on the very good points raised so farnote already supported so not stacking the results w a 2nd thumbs up
insa thanks for the supporteternal is an aspiring pvp alt of a carebear main it is indeed a spoof of bellum eternus and the corp name is a spoof of every pvp hardcore corp name i have ever come across a couple of months back when bellum was doing his carebear windup posts i started a new one under this alt in the same style but by the content obviously a  take of bellum however it was the carebears who made it funny by responding as if it was bellum and they put lots of arguments why pve is not imbalanced good for the game and pays ccp to develop the game etcthis went on for several pages and bellum replied saying how funny he found it that pve people thought the post was a him btook it seriouslyafter that i was inspired to keep this alt and train him up for fw and pvp i aim to be the worst pvper in eve please pod me sometimei do want questions asked about ccp the storyline team and this rushed content not because of any feeling of carebear selfimportance but basic issues about a quality assurance  how does stuff this badly thought through get thrown straight in for players by their own admission they rushed it into dominion because of their excitement in it development this is amateurb how did a pve orientated team ever think that content designed like this would be a good idea this does raise issues about their knowledge and understanding of the pve playerbase a competence issue these people are paid with our moneycborking storyline content like this for only one faction has consequences since storylines are the only way of raising factiond no testing at all before implementation  not on sisi not even a run it past the csm members as a concept in these days of interwebs communications focus groups online questionnaires it is easy to test ideas also testing in game stuff is much more than just bug hunting it is also about testing game play and impacts none of this was done all that happened was some hyperactive developers in their group think excitement threw this crap at gallente players with no fore thoughte they said it was experimental content but apart from us whining on forums they put in no feedback mechanism aimed specifically at this content so you set up an experiment but forget to put in a mechanism for collecting feedback they just left it to chance that people like me would whine no little questionnaire if you tried it did it abandoned it turned it down  no rating no comments collected i have done this for websites and it isnt rocket science to do they just pulled it out of thin air with no clear plan rushed it through no formal feedback mechanism no testing in any form no option to take part broke faction standing gain for one faction showed ignorance of pve players and what we wantgiven the background to this disaster as a paying customer wanting questions asked is not arrogance or selfimportance but a reasonable request it raises questions yet again about ccps development procedures bootini anyone competence and whether they are trustworthy pos t2 material duping bug left in for years t2 bpo seeding scandal ccp staff supporting some alliances cover ups by ccp until issues are exploded on public forums  they do not have a good history herejust as things start to pickup ccp have a knack of mucking up this is just one in a long line of amateur ups
ccp just finished a lot of work with planetary designs and layouts so they might not want to delve that deeply just a few months later into planetary design however i would appreciate these changesas someone who uses the scientific articles to immerse myself into the game i think this would help me get deeper into the game as well as others who see this game as more than the next ship to destroy or the next item to build there is anything wrong with these behaviors  as an mmo the game is what you make of itsupported
need to fix the planets before we move onto them thanks for support on my topic as well
introduction and tldr versionwe all have seen how sov warfare is going on the huge problem we have here is lag as eve population is increasing we expect to have always lag with big fights despite the introducion of all the ultimate hardware and thats actually a gameplay mechanic issue if we put in place a new sov capturing system based on dominion that compels forces to split and fight over many fights in some different solar system we fix lag once for all and well have more dinamical and enjoyable fights this would not solve problems related to timezone warfare but those issues are pretty unsolvable given the priority of real life work and sleep over game activities
after some battles i came to the conclusion that we still need a system that forces attackers and defenders on different battlefields everybody knows thisin order for the game to be enjoyable we need a mechanic that forces fleet and coalitions to split over many objectiveslast night there has been a fight in 49 with something like 1400 people lag was terrible and node crashed and al that because the only winning strategy is to put as many pilots as you can on the same target it is called focus fireright now there is no reason to split forces between different objectives even if one of the ccp aims with dominion was forcing fleets to splitin eve focus fire is the most effective way to fightit would be the most effective way to fight in every competition but over a certain scale usually it ceases to be the best tacticwhy dominion did not succeed in splitting a big fight into smaller less laggy fightsin real life armies and navies forces are split for mainly 2 reason1 weakness of critical objectives2 lack of mobility compared to the vastness of the battlefieldso if you have to protect an important target you have to stand by it in order to be ready to fight for it its survivability being very critical because of its instrinsic weakness and it makes no sense to call reinforcements from far away because they will arrive too late because of the mobility issueright now all the structures that have any role in sovereignty conquest have a monstrous amount of hitpoints and subcapital fleet and even non sieged capital fleet can be redeployed anywhere in a solar system within maximum 2 minutes this is the complete opposite to what compels forces in real life to splitso what i suggestmy suggestion work on fleet mobility compared to the vastness of the battlefieldsolution increase the vastness of the battlefield from a solarsystem to a constellation or a smaller group of stars leave all structure hitpoints as they are now but instead of solar system based sovereignty consider only constellation based sovereigntyif constellations are too big just use another grouptype of systems attacker and defenders have to split over many systems and so their mobility is reduced if confronted with the size of the battlefield you will need to control more systems than your opponent the side that has the higher scores gains sovereignty of the constellation this is important there will be only constellationwide reinforcement timers with all sbus outpost and ihub exiting reinforced mode at the same timethe entrance in reinforced mode could happen in many ways could be when all systems in the constellation have been reinforced
interesting idea but it comes with one obvious problem one of the purposes of dominion was supposed to be to make sov warfare an option for smaller groups making the minimum amount of space that can be held a constellation flips that on its head  it means you need an even bigger force to take sov and cuts off the bottom end even more thoroughly than the old system did it might be interesting it could even be a good idea but theres definitely need for caution here
i think the idea behind dominion was to get more small groups into 00 the more systemsthings you have to control to have sov the larger the alliance has to bemy understanding is there are three different components to why blobs arent formed in real warfare1 everything has a limit to its mobility as you said2 there is a strategic benefit to attacking multiple locations  it prevents the defenders from being able to dig in and mass their forces  the longer a force is in place the greater the tactical advantage they hold3 heavily fortified locations are not selfsustainingthe reason for blob warfare is the timezone inclusiveness of eve the very strength that allows eve to appeal to players around the world is the cause of blob warfare even the ops idea of adding more targets spread around a constellation wont do the trick alliances have plenty of titans and cynos to quickly take down one target then jump to the next target there would need to be a mechanic forcing people to hit multiple targets simultaneously to break up fleets instead of the blockade units which failed miserably at spreading out fleets have the invulnreinforcement set by another defensive structure sort of like a rr structurestructures that have bonuses to repairing each other think rr fleet but will not remote rep each other if they are taking local damage local tank has primary concern each would obviously also have to have weapons as well to prevent a single ship sitting on each while the fleet hits a primary targetallow more than one in a system so even within a single system fleets would be on multiple grids allow each to have multiple system range to provide rr perhaps constellationwide so the big alliancescoalitions have a dozen targets to hit at the same time since bigger targets draw bigger fleetsthis post just got way out of hand so im going to make a separate new post with this idea and link it here as well as link your idea in the new post let people read both and decide what they prefer
ive taken into consideration the issued you raised1 small entities would be disadvantaged if the space unit is costellation instead of the single solar system considerations and possible solution if it really matterswe could use a smaller unit made of 34 systems instead of a whole constellation the biggest engagements are now made of 1400 people if you split them in 3 part you have 3 fights with 406 people a mean or little more if they try to move even if the local peaked at 700 the game should be enjoyableotherwise you could solve the problem just splitting the problem in two part contesting sov and achieving sov while the first part needs a lot of people usually the second is not a problem if you conquer the system and you want to give it to a smaller alliance let them online the tcu in that system instead of you 2 mobility over many system is not an issue for capital fleet considerations and possible solution if it really matters first if the systems are cynojammed then capitals mobility is at maximum equal to those of subcapital fleet and only for the defenders for they can use jumpbridges even with cynojammers down the mobility of capital fleet is an issue because they must have enough capacitor and if dreads are in siege you cannot move them but anyway the defenders have convenience in keeping the cynojammer up and stop attackers capital moves while attacker will try to kill jbs to reduce defenders mobilitydont you see this will be a chess match with lot of tactics involved where the smartness of the fleet commender really mattersand even if after these considerations you find mobility of capitals too high nerf a bit their cap recharge or the level they need to jump i think that this is not necessary btw  and i hear capital pilots alredy whining with reason
every race needs ships that use every weapon type in order to encourage crosstraining gallente missile boats are already incredibly minimaltheres the racial bomber plus vague attempts by the eris and lachesis and that really is it they dont need a further nerf if you want to buff the eris buff its missiles not its guns drop 3 turrets add 3 missiles change the destroyer bonuses to velocity and precision of missiles and buff the cpu until it can use 7 standard launchers sanely it doesnt need to be a crap boat just because its gallente and missilebased but it does need to actually work within that role

destroers arent terribly broken it just requires good fitting skills and a little thinking to figure out how to use them properly which is why most people seem to have trouble with it
eris is so sexybut so bad
although the proposed insurance payout rate is still too high for my liking at least its better then the current situation supporteduh huh and is that optimal at current levels which are roughly twice what they were not so long ago or was the optimal when they were at an all time high before the last fanfestyou do not make an argument for the current fixed insurance prices at all any number of options are available to substitute insurance in order to maintain this mineral price floor that should be a complete nonissuesay mineral basket price more then doubles so now insurance only covers half of the hull cost what happens to your burger flipper then malcanis proposal would see him reasonably covered in both situations regardless of mineral prices
insurance definatly needs a nerfi havent read everything but i have an idea about an insurance nerfonly 3 levels of insurancehisec insurance  50 payed only if lost in hiseclowsec  75 payed only if lost in lowsec00  100 payed only if lost in 00orthese levels for each type of current insurancethis way concord gets nerfed and you get a new way to do riscbased insurance
if you average over the market of all regions it becomes more difficult to manipulate also payout values dont have to be updated in realtime it would be enough to adjust them once a week or even a monthim not sure what percentage of market value should be payed out youd need to do some heavier math or simulations to determine what is saneif insurance gets an overhaul say making insurance payout 50 of market value t2 and faction ships should also be included so they start to see at least some reasonable insurance payouts yes the number of moons does not scale so this might cause some problems with goo price because of increased demand but thats because ccp missed an opportunity to implement a system that actually scalesfinally adjust payout by another factor y if the loss was caused by concord
would also be good with exportimport option supported
this is if anything too good a blocklist proposal
i of course support the op t
and so do i
i think it would be nice if i could use my national identity card to log in its also not entirely foolproof ofc but it is more secure than just fancy password and username
the rsa token does not have to be a hard token as detailed in a link i posted in the general sectionthis linkeven if your pc had a keylogger on it as the key is not generated on your pc they still cannot get the code to access your account the number generated is done with an algorithm linked to your details it generates a new number every minuteat the server end it is running the same algorithm as your key generator so can verify the number enteredthe cost of this technology has come down so it need not cost a fortune the question is how much are your in game assets worth to you

supported
nothing wrong with that
these all seem like pretty cool ideas
yeah i suppose this makes sense the pirate ship and pirate implant offers are fine but there should also probably be offers for things like pirate gear and pirate pos towersmodules they dont have to be great offersthough it is lp that can only be acquired in 00 so it shouldnt be too awful either but they should exist also be sure to make the items that take the place of tags be thematically appropriate  drugs people stuff from rival factions all that
a lot of missions that you run give you navy tags and concord tags but a bit of variety would be good rival commander tags would be great boosters anything pirate themedwhile id like to see any generic faction gear pos modules regular ship modules etc available id also like to see other pirate stuff available maybe pirate trade goods that you could smuggle into empire and sell
supporting this and the option to buy a plank module for high slots
sounds like a good idea
yes indeed would be nice if ccp were to take a look at pirate faction implants as well  slaves snakes and crystals are valuable and fetch a good price halos are pretty poor and talismans are flat out terrible
agreed
my alt account which has always been paid with plex gives me a 10day countdown on the login screen to account expiry my main account which still has a credit cardalbeit an expired one attached to it does not change how this works so that everyone sees when their subscription expires in advance or at least so that anyone can turn on the option that said a downtimelike countdown in the last hour of the subscription doe make good sense
nah civilianmade ships should be held together with bubblegum i dont see any real need to make them more survivable moving their hp into hull might work but in order for it to make sense youd have to pull down their shield hp which i dont think most hulk pilots will appreciate
yes remote asset management needs a few improvements in this vein
ccp is planning on rolling out new forum software soontm as well as other facebooklike tools hopefully these ideas are already in the works if they arent they should be
i know about the spacebook thing now called new eden but i havent heard anything about specific tools for proposalscsm do you have any link
i agree completely with the points youve raised
qft
sorry for the delayed response  stuff happenedto respond to your points in order1 fair enough the battling the lag monster thread seems to have stagnated a bit at the very least2 this is already done to some degree both when testing is done and during normal fleet fights i dont think the battle reports on the various forum sections go unseen by the communityrelated ccp employees who will likely subsequently deliver reports on playersatisfaction and overall service delivery back to the development team which likely includes date time location and playercounts that theres no direct feedback from them on the true limits if you will on what the server is able to handle only serves to frustrtate the players when they exceed an invisible threshold without realising it until its too late3 unfortunately the content developmentconcept teams and the codeserver maintenance and development teams arent quite the same thing they may work together to implement new features but the content guys as an example arent responsible for keeping the server running smoothly because of this its easier for them to lay out a roadmap of content they want to and know they can implement before date x then give an expansion date to roll it out it  when server lag issues arise its not like ccp has a roadmap of things they can and will be able to do to fix it until theyve worked on it4 as far as im aware they already do this as they have to let us know whenever theyre rolling out a patch or extending a downtime for serverside maintenance as it is they also generally let us know when they apply serverside hotfixes for things5 understandable but keep in mind that their shareholders are likely responsible for a far larger portion of their operating revenuesustaining costs than the portions of the playerbase directly affected by the current situation that might decide to emoragequitkeep in mind that if the great 00 powers had to leave the game thered be massive holes in 00 for empire bears previously too afraid to try to siphon themselves into refilling the gap growing up new powers drawing in different players all over again6 this again brings us back to the issue of filing reports which ill cover belowthe points marked with stars youll notice all but 1 were are ones where your responses werent quite answers to what i was askingright now your focus appears to be on getting ccp to deliver consistently frequent updates on what it is theyre doing to the servers or code to try and identify then remove lag causing issuesassuming they had to write up a report the likes of these
i support what this csm is trying to do the lag yesterday in a big battle waswell it ruined the game for me at the time ccp has got to fix these lag issues or give us solutions to avoid the lag and still enjoy all facets of the game
i remembering talking about this and wanting it so yeah supported
as long as these dont even come close to obsoleting minmatar outposts i can support it might be interesting
good idea
wonderful idea maybe make it so they can only be anchored in a wh class  c4 so that rorqs wouldnt get shafted in c56s
that would be saying its wormhole specific how is that fair to kspace dwellers
sound idea supported if you cant see your enemy because of a technical issue related to network and servers the least you should expect is that you dont get destroyed for it
omg im agreeing with a goon it isnt much fun being on a turkey shoot and its less fun being the turkey

could be a potential exploit but hell couldnt be much worse than what is there nowmaybe make the player visible but not targetable until he has loaded grid
the only way i could picture this being implemented would be a client side i am ready signal which i give people about a week to figure out how to blockdelayin theory i would love this since personally i have lost ships and pods before i even loaded leaving form station but the alternative seems even worse
good idea grids need to expand as well multiple times people will be at the end of a grid than while aligning people start to go off grid
yep
wh corps have the issue of pos life and how to prevent the ease of corp theftin an effort to provide more security while not taking away accessiblity provide the ability for players to lock their ships into the sma with a password that would prevent other people from boardinglaunching the ship directors would maintain the ability to override said password and boardlaunch the ship themselves this would allow increased security while keeping accessiblity as in autonomous pos living up
nice idea pos security is an issue and this would help
oh yes seconded perhaps even for the sake of organization add tabs to a sma
supported great idea
passwords seem unwieldy id prefer tabbing them like a corp hangar
instead of passwording set a flag of ownership on each shipas it stands you can set a jet can to be public or privatedo the same for a ship original owner of the ship onlyetc
i like it a lot
shrugsi have already admitted my guilt in thinking that i could propose and debate this issue as id do with adults but in fact only you and maybe a couple more people only showed the least rational behavior and adult thinkingbut then again i wouldnt have thought that thered be the need to educate anybody on the simple issues behind the requestsanyhowmission bookmarks pros all of them potential since youd actually need to bookmark space to obtain any benefit no magic wand of free isk here UFFFD great increase in mission space gameplay value thanks to the reduction of travel times UFFFD eliminates the grief and annoyment of returning to a mission particularly important for people with social lifes UFFFD allows pve configured ships to quickly warpoutrefitwarpin when threatened opening a pvp scenario currently unavailable and very interesting UFFFD streamlines salvaging looting in active missions cons UFFFD none there is no automatic gain unbalancemwds in acceleration gate missions pros UFFFD alternative to mission bookmarks UFFFD adds variety to missions cons UFFFD potentially breaks mission scripts2d graphics additions debris ricochet shells etc pros UFFFD makes the game battles more appealing and rich and thus more attractive UFFFD easy to implement conss UFFFD none since they are client side only require no network bandwidth and can be toggled on and off as a normal video option
obviously supported  great idea
obvious
oh yes and i have while in eve university learning blown away a shipmate by accident for this very reason it was a great demonstration of what not to do 
this is one of those tiny changes that can make the difference between life and death
hi
agree with this suggestion 100 it is way to hard to see when modules are active sometimes i find myself tilting my ships view to see which are and which arent and this is on a 22 high refresh lcd
because gallente is the drone race and the current information bonuses are simply not practical i propose that the bonuses be changed to be drone orientedskilldrone discipline skill 3 to drone control range per levelgang assist modulesdrone warfare link  constitution 2 to all drone hit pointsdrone warfare link  affliction 2 to all drone damagedrone warfare link  echo feedback 2 to all drone speed and trackingthoughts
all other gang link bonuses are kind of passive your drones would get an offensive bonus not sure that would follow the principle
the infowar modules are useful but they really dont belong as a gallante racial spec since when were gallante the ewar race anywaythe whole leadership skilltree needs a little shine anyway marlonas drone warfare link idea is a good one  but lets add a 2nd tier of offensive warfare links which are available through the lp store at about the same lp cost level as a faction hardener  so 3050 mill or so1st tieramarr armor warfarecaldari seige warfaregallante suggestionsminmatar skirmish warfare2nd tieramarr cap warfarecaldari info warfaregallante drone warfareminmatar suggestions thermodynamics bonuses
minitracking optimal falloff dmg for turretsalthough it will be tough to balancetempests with bonuses from a command ship with 3 turret gang linkswould roughly mean 375 more alphathat might make ganking too easymaybe the rof rather than dmg bonus
i made a proposal several months ago about new race gang links and was flamed to hell and back i guess whatever is not acceptable one month is ok a couple months latergranted a damage bonus is offensive oriented but seriously drones need love and the info links are rarely used at all
malcanis those ideas look good when you put them down as a list of categories id wager that theyll look much less good when you try to create three useful balanced interesting gang links in each of 8 categories and realize that you can find maybe 16 of the 24 youd want
well instead of like an entire new tier of gang links what about one new one for each race that gives a bonus to something offensive wise they could possibly be isolated to specific weapons too instead of a general fieldfor examplearmored warfare link  crystal synthesizer 2 to all lasor capacitor needsnow granted it does nothing for armor but it would allow the damnation and legion to give it bonuses because it falls under that type of linkthe other three races would deal with something that would make thier weapons more effectivegallente  optimal range rofminmitar  tracking rofcaldari  whatever makes the explosion velocity better other missile crapthoughts
as it has once been proposed i think gallente should have assault warfare links giving improvements to blasters that is damagerof tracking and falloff aybe bonus to web power drones as secondary works as well i guess
we would not want to make ganking too easy that would be bad
information warfare links are  only ones that do get used are armor in rr gangs shield pos repping and minnie tackle range this is why you see damnations and claymores and sometimes vultures die on killboardsyou dont ever see eoss after ccp nerfed them to  nobodys been flying them thats because the ship is  and information warfare links are also therei fully support any change for the better of gallente gang mods
yeah perfectly sensible
supported
supporting
supported but more one thing make shotable not just enable smartbombing them
totally not supported everyone supporting this idea are just the guys who get killed when theyre probed out fail more
no wayremove probes from overview period
stupid that you cant add it
ill support this if poss are removed from wh spaceso no
i explore for a living and so far ive never lost a ship from being probed out and busted in a site lost one from warping into a site where the gate was camped and one from fleeing probers to run into their buddies gatecamp mind you i can use the scanner to find them sufficiently well but its just annoying because its so badly designed not challenging not skilful just tedious if probes were added to the overview id check just as often as i do now and have the same chances of getting caughtonly id be less annoyed in the process by wading through the same two dozen small railgun batteriesbeing able to filter probes wouldnt save people who forget to scan  align and a cumbersome boring interface is not the right way to balance anything
fantastic idea that only makes sense those of us who use the ds religiously while mininggassingdoing a combat site would love this option
not supported just lazy ppl wanting a 1 click notification that someone is looking for them too easy and no i am not a pirate
i would have had more sympathy for that argument back when a scan for a maxedout prober would take about 20 seconds and it wasnt possible to locate someone and then scan them down in such rapid sequence
you realize you can already see probes using your directional scanner right this isnt really about adding anything but being able to filter out the rest of the junk
dust 514 is soon finished and took alot of time to develop i as a eve player payed for that time with my eve subscription and i havnt got anything back accept a buggy dominion were fleet fights are lag fests and node crash parties and taking a system takes longer shooting tcus than posses in ahpocoryphia my proposal is to reimburs lost develop time with extra attention read more develop time when dust hits the community
are you saying that ccp isnt allowed to make moneyif ccp decides to invest some of that money they earned from eve into another mmo called dust 514 that is fine with mebesides wasnt it ccp shanghai  or something that was working with dust 514
correct the normal eve team is still working on eve iirctamber
omg you should ask someone to hug you if you need attention that badlyanyway back to your idea i guess you didnt watch the video from the fanfestif you did you would have known thata the dust team was independent from the normal eve teamb that lot of improvements for dustincarna benefit the normal eve code base aswell coreification new inventory systemc especially coreification made sure that improvements benefit all parts of eve and not just eg dust or incarna or eve itselflast but not least i have to say your attitude is amazing you pay 15 bucks and behave like you would put millions into ccp wow just wow
my proposal is that you stop making proposals
is there any way to vote mr lab rat off the island
not supported due to op failing at corporate structure 101 
you give me all of your stuff transfer your chars over and leavethat should be compensation enough for making me read your proposal
lab rat you spelled your corp name wrong red green is very disappointed with you also your proposal is crazy and makes no sense
the op may need to take a refresher on business finance  specifically in regards to investments rarely are business investments completely mutually exclusive money is only one part of the assets that go into an investment money is the only easily reassigned asset between different investments it may also be to the ops benefit to review how foreign investments in china work the op seems to imply ccp shanghai is a wholly owned subsidiary of ccp pretty sure it is an fie foreign invested enterprise as foreign companiespersons are not allowed to directly hire chinese citizens in china ccp shanghai is likely a joint venture with chinese venture capitalists foreigners can only owncontribute up to 50 of the fie so ccp games paid at most 50 of the cost to develop dust 514 and it is likely the venture capitalists wouldnt have plunked down their half or more of the money for an expansion provided for free to gamers
i think the idea behind dominion was to get more small groups into 00 the more systemsthings you have to control to have sov the larger the alliance has to bethere are three different components that prevent blobs from forming in real wars1 everything has a limit to its mobility as you said2 there is a strategic benefit to attacking multiple locations  it prevents the defenders from being able to dig in and mass their forces  the longer a force is in place the greater the tactical advantage they hold3 heavily fortified locations are not selfsustainingthe reason for blob warfare is the timezone inclusiveness of eve the very strength that allows eve to appeal to players around the world is the cause of blob warfare alliances have plenty of titans and cynos to create a very mobile blob to break up fleets in eve a mechanic forcing people to hit multiple targets simultaneously is needed instead of the blockade units which failed miserably at spreading out fleets have the invulnreinforcement set by another defensive structure sort of like a rr structurestructures that have bonuses to repairing each other think rr fleet but will not remote rep each other if they are taking local damage unlike an organized rr fleet each would obviously also need defensive weapons as well to prevent a single ship sitting on each while the fleet hits a primary targetallow more than one in a system so even within a single system fleets would be on multiple grids allow each to have a multiple system range for rr  maybe constellationwide since bigger targets draw bigger fleets the bigger the alliancescoalitions attackingdefending the more targets have to be hit at the same time this thread originally was a suggestion for changes for this post you can read both and decide if either is better than the current system
since i hope that sov war is fixed once for all as soon as possible i support this thread ad hope csm will discuss on this topic and see all the proposals
if only we had something to clear grids of blobs i dont know something that could simply wipe out a fleet of battleships and keep the local counts down so the node would stay stable of course this device or whatever it would be would have to cost an enormous amount of isk and time to build so that in order to field it you would have to risk tremendous alliance assets if implemented these devices could even have the side effect of fleets splitting up onto multiple grids in order to not put all eggs in one basket further helping node stabilitywhat do you think
bump as this is more of a technical issueafter allwould you enjoy fps games if your real fov was in error 515 degrees to the left or right of true center mass
id recently got the scanning helper thing from the grismar wiki to check on this when experiencing the issue while trying to use directional in a vigil  turns out the issue is the ship centers the block has moved for some ships which makes the old thing of aligning a scan target with the block useless since the directional is based on the center of your view not where that block isin some other ships it does feel like something else is wrong though so i can entirely support finding a way to make the directional scanner more practical for everyday usage
this could be why ive never noticed this and i am a very heavy dscan user if you zoom out so that the block is effectively your entire ship does the problem go away
supported just hilarious that the uk terrorist gankers want this fixed
i dont usually get down to 5 degrees because i can never seem to align the camera properly interesting to know that this is why yes fix it please also some kind of visual display of where is being scanned would be very nice
i never had that issue as i dont use the block i just point the middle of the screen camera in direction of what i want to scan but if it is a bug it deserves fixin
yeah i agree
the 10 person watchlist size is too small for logistic pilots even with broadcasts we should be able to see whos taking damagewhy bother with a 10 person list size if lagg is an issue make it the size of a full wing  50 people 
double post ftw
i supported this idea last time it was raised but im pretty sure that the csm has already approved it and passed it along if so it doesnt need to be raised again
wait a sec i just thought this up if theres an example of parallel thought coolonly 1 thing since no one else has mentioned same link it please
the csm has already passed it to ccp and was rejected from the minutes of the last meeting in iceland found at
no your name sums it up terrorist in high space pretty much if you dont want to read it dont read it thank youhave a pleasant day
9 a state in which the supreme power is held by the people a republican or democratic statefrom dictionarycoms definition of commonwealthyknow while were assuming peoples names have anything to do with the way they play eve though i dont deny being a big ol meaniehead in empire to those who shoot before they think edit okay i actually went through the trouble of reading through your walls of text which have now burned an inverted image into my eyes thanks and feel that my summary was actually quite accurateon the whole its only reasonable to expect that if you shoot someone they can shoot back theres an aggression timer in the topleft of your screen whenever youre shooting npcs that starts at 15 minutes im assuming youve moused over that at least once and noticed that it listed the npcs you were shooting at  it does the same when you shoot at playersif im not mistaken the first time you ever engage someone thats stolen from you you get a warning  i could very well be wrong on this  assuming you dont its still only reasonable to expect that they are perfectly entitled to shoot back at youwhat happened to you in your mission was not griefing that was normal unadulterated fair play what happened to you while you were mining was not griefing that was normal silly fair playthere is nothing here for ccp to improve as as things stand they have already afforded those that feel they are being griefed with a variety of tools to get theirs back with and whenever those tools are used and ultimately failed with those that tried to use them and failed cannot accept that they didnt know what they were getting themselves into and died as a result and then feel cheatedmoral of the story if you cant afford to lose it dont use it
physically more correct planets and atmospheres  another thing that should be done before dustill go ahead and support this one also mostly the part about layered interaction  as i think that as podpilot current design of being able to intearct with the surface with just policy level is ok in the atmospheric layers however i would love to see ability to deploy some specific structures even if they would be controlled by hired dusters
i can agree with this
there are two reasons why shield tanks arent as prevalent as you think they should be1 there are 25 races that armor tank and only 15 that shield tank minmatar can do both well that means on average we shouldnt see more than 375 shield tanked ships in a mixed gang2 missiles generally arent used for fleet pvp since the most notable shield tankers are the caldari that puts them at a penalty however they have the specialized ships for pvp ecm boats and tacklersill agree that gang bonuses are kinda out of whack but that is far from examining and changing the whole mechanic i see no reason to support this proposal in its current iteration
some few things need a bit a tweaking like local armor reps and shield transporters but the overall balance between armor and shield is one of things that dont need fixing
yes
the fact the defender has the advantage in picking when the rf timed fight occurs in a sense is good you dont want the systems to flip too easily or folks wont invest in the upgrades by the same token the sbus are so fragile compared to the sov structures themselves that they wind up dead in a couple of minutes the race between aaasyskit etc and goons demonstrated that last night in spades the decision to race goons was fail for aaa etc you gotta take them on in a big fleet fight or bring a bazillion dreads to hit the ihubi think the sbu ehp should be increased a tad but most of all ccp needs to sort out the node crashes the current fights in 49 are no bigger than delve ii yet we have crippling lag crashes rollbacks and black screens on log in which will screw one side or the otherccp has to know that ing off 1300 people daily is a bad move those same folks are the ones with multiple accounts greatest longevity and contribute a large chunk of their bottom line income get information out there about the issue and get some test patches up to try to get this stuff sorted
ccps economist already keeps gamewide price indexes and has said in past that if they ever get unhappy with existing monetary policy they have both isk taps and isk sinks that they can bring online to balance things out this seems unnecessary to me
judging by the other thread you brought up i am assuming that you mean that you want keep at range to work for any one given object not that you want a keep at range from all objects button if i understand you correctly i can support that
the epic story lines are good and id love to see regular storylines that were admittedly much smaller versionsstory line missions should be 24 missions in length all from the same agent and all offer small increases with a big payoff at the end write 10 trade 10 combat and 10 courier for each level and youre done i really like the potential in the mission system but it is let down by a lack of new content being added to it in favour of new admittedly pretty great things like epic arcs
its a good idea but i dont think its quite the right approach
there are plenty of ways to get a jump clone made for you it also only takes about a week of standings grinding to get up enough to install one
yeah the star map looks cool and is okay for some purposes but its a real pain to move around it or to limit the view to only the part youre interested in improvements would be very nice
suicide ganking aside the whole premise of having insurance in new eden is kind of silly it only exists because the magical npc bank never runs out of isk what rational mind would insure a ship in a galaxy at a constant state of conflict removing insurance entirely would be a stronger solution giving the players complete control over the marketbarring that removing insurance from concordkilled losses makes perfect sense having the npcpolice alliance blow up your ship and then make sure you are paid for it is nonsensical
i posted this on page six or something of a coad thread but the chances of it being noticed there are zero apologies for crossposting but this is a serious proposalthere seems to be a very healthy market in sovereignty blockade units they get placed in systems they get blown up and people buy new ones to place againmost useful items in this game are manufactured by players and thats one of the great things about eve why are sovereignty blockade units differentcould we ask ccp to seed some blueprints on the market so my industrial alt can make sovereignty blockade units some corps are spending billions on these and its a shame for all that isk to go to waste
game mechanicssov blockade units anchorable by already sov holding alliances to prevent a defender from anchoring their owns thus securing the system beforehand to prevent station or ihub reinforcing to a conquerable state by simply offlining the sbus when stationihub exiting reinforced mode and sending them back into invulnerable state needs a look into
do i understand this correctly that to be discuessed at a csm meeting i need to point out the topic in this threadif so please consider the bounty hunter topic for the next meetingthank you

yay ccp gave them some love patches notes dominion 11 ships with a covert jump portal generator can now bridge to a cynosural generator array as well as a cynosural fieldhowever they need more love they are still broken
let me start off by saying that i love my blasters and have generally little experience with lasers so feel free to ignore whatever i say about them which isnt muchi am entirely open for the suggestion that the best blaster boost is a pulse laser nerf but i think thats equally hard to do right the recent projectile changes seem to be a success thoughid like to propose some ideas that could work togetherfirstly theres not much wrong with blaster damage yes it probably needs to be taken up a notch to compensate vs laser range or ac falloff i would even be willing to trade a tiny bit of range for that not much though a slight increase to tracking also seems appropriate to give them the distinct advantage at the ranges they are meant for however some of the numbers mentioned here are just way out there 50 300 no waywhat id really like is a hybrids 20 given blasters short range they are currently the only short range weapons that cant do meaningful damage outside of web range and they are even not welcome in certain fleets where you are required to hit at 20 by simply switching ammo large guns rails have to come in and fill the gapgiven projectiles alpha strike and the range of beams i realize that might be much thanks to the apocalypse though how about making rails the medium range of the long range weapons with better tracking and dps than both projectiles and beams ie beams become the long range weapon with the most range but suffers from tracking projectiles have alpha but shorter range and rails ends up in the middle with decent tracking and good dpsas is the rokh for instance reach ridiculous distances with little effort but do little damage shorterranged rails with more dps would probably make it a very nice midtolong range sniper to get the megathron to do the same you would have to sacrifice damage mods for range mods to reach the same distance balancing out the dps advantage of the megathrons bonus the apocalypse would end up being the new rokh if beam range is boosted overall  ridiculous range but little damage  i have no absolute idea on how to fix that perhaps swap its range bonus for a damage or tracking bonus this type of rails would also mean that a rail deimos would be a viable option for those that arent comfortable with the upclose range of blastersfinally how about redoing short range t2 ammo entirely  even less range then they have today void range perhaps half of that of am for instance far less damage less than any other ammunition type but a massive tracking bonus that would be across the board not just for hybrid ammothe goal would be for a ship especially one with a tracking bonus to be really dangerous to ships one class smaller than itself orbiting it zealots orbiting a megathron at 500 for instance even ships without tracking bonus would have a chance afs orbiting a deimos at 500 for instance if blasters in general are given a slight tracking boost granted this should not be a i win button ab afs would still be very difficult to hit and this does not at all change anything with regards to signature radiusthis idea was presented to me a while back and its been taking hold ever since at least the first part the goal stated is taking it further than its progenitor did i supposeand finally tanking thats part of the price you pay for facemelt damage and what makes us blaster pilots i love my deimos even with the little tank it has most pilots knows its damage potential thats a good tank in itself otherwise range decides either the deimos runs away or your opponent is in scrambler range tank doesnt matter either way edit fixed a mistake in the t2 ammo suggestion wregards to damage
hoping to get some more attention to this  minor improvements are still improvements 
ive been saying from the start that the 5k bonus is a poor bonusyou have just agreed with me and then told me im not telling the truth if the bonus is poor as we seems to agree upon at last then the ship will be negativelly affectedweaker bonus  bonus is fineat least i have logic so far in this post you have condradicted yourself twice  once in the same sentencedo you understand what a percentage is if a  low damage  starts of with 100 damage and get 5 per level  at level 5 he has 125 damageif b  high damage  starts of with 140 damage and gets 5 per level  at level 5 he has 175 damagea low damage gets 25 extra damage  b high damage gets 35 extra damageso b gets more extra damage than a  keeping them in balance between low and high damageso no higher damage weapons dont need a higher percentage they get more extra damage from the same percentage  because its a percentage no a fixed increase
i take issue with that ships are balanced on a shiptoship basis bonuses are just one aspect of itfor example here is an analogy of your argument of fail when applied to another aspect of a shipdo you agree that the myrmidons 1175 powergrid is worse than 1500 powergrid of the harbinger do you agree that myrmidon will be negatively effected by its powergrid being 1175 rather than 1500 weaker powergrid  powergrid is fineboost myrmidons powergrid to 1500 how can you guys not see this my argument is full of truth myrmidon is far weaker than harbinger11see the absurdity of your argument now
i see the absurdity of your desperate counter argumenta myrms main weapons are its drones which consume 0 powergridcompared to a harby whos main weapons are medium lasers which consume plenty of powergridto make an objective analysis you would need to work out what percentage of the grid required for a perfect t2 fit is available to each ship
good now you see the necessity to include other aspects of a ship in a ship balancing discussion rather than just focusing on one whether it be bonuses or powergrid
lets be very clear here so you dont try to misquote meall aspects of a ship be that cpupowergridcapshieldarmorresistsharpoints whatever and bonuses are important to achiving ship balanceis it neccessary to analysis all that to point out a problem area noit has been shown and not disputed that a 5 kin only bonus is weaker than a rofdpl bonusbecause bonuses are applied to a ship for player skill trained the performance of the ship in question alters as players skill upa damage bonused cmbs performance increases by 16 per level of skill traineda damage bonused gun boats performance increase by 5 per level of skill trainedin simple terms hull training on cmbs returns less bangs for your bucks than hull training on gundrone boatsthe kin only bonus set at 5 per level means it is impossible for a cmb to be balanced at all player skill levelslet me expand on that there are 2 extremes of possibilitya at high skill levels cmbs are balanced v other boatsthe implication here is that cmbs start from a higher base of performance all things considered and that other boats catch up because they have a more powerful bonusb at high skill levels cmbs are underperforming v other boatsthe implication here is that cmbs start from the same base performance all things considered and fall behind in performance v other boats because they have a weaker bonusso which is it or is it somewhere in between the two
counterexampledroneboats get 10 bonuses on their drones per level and they are still balanced versus gunboats with 5 bonuses on their gunsso by your logica at high skill levels droneboats are balanced v other boatsthe implication here is that droneboats start from a higher base of performance all things considered and that other boats catch up because they have a more powerful bonusb at high skill levels droneboats are underperforming v other boatsthe implication here is that droneboats start from the same base performance all things considered and fall behind in performance v other boats because they have a weaker bonusso which is it or is it somewhere in between the two
they are weak at high lvls thats for sure 
erm i would answer the question straight away but the above two statements are incorrentdrone boat bonuses are larger than other boats not smallerthe above statements were prepared where the first ship mentioned has the smaller bonusbut i understand what you are asking socorrecting those statementsa at high skill levels droneboats are balanced v other boatsthe implication here is that droneboats start from a lower base of performance all things considered and that drone boats catch up because they have a more powerful bonusb at high skill levels droneboats are overperforming v other boatsthe implication here is that droneboats start from the same base performance all things considered and increase in performance v other boats because they have a better bonusi would say to the corrected logic  looking at larger bonuses on dronesboats thatdomi is towards amyrm is towards avexor is bishtar is close to bbut having said that i dont begrudge other races there great shipsif you want to start a balance drone boats thread  please do it elsewhere
everybody knows that ships are balanced around max skills balancing ships around skillsati and ignoring their balance at v would be utterly stupid
please prove your statementthis is a reasonable request as you have in the past require proof from meproof or support this topic
would you support a blanket bonus change of changing them to 5 drone damage and hitpoints per level
i will neither support nor discourage a drone boat bonus change in this threadto do so would widen the scope of the op to include drone boats and cmbsthe proper place for support or otherwise would be in a thread about drones boat bonusesi would only give my support or otherwise after carefully reading the points made by the op of that thread and reading the arguments for and against
please answer the question for the sake of the argument it illustrates the very reason that i cannot support your suggestion to reiteratehypothetically if a person creates a thread calling for blanket drone bonus changes and this is the exact reason and analysis he providesand he wants a single blanket change to the bonuses of all droneboats such as moving 10 down to 5 would you hypothetically support his suggestion
required but not received i should add all the proof of balancearoundv that is needed is the obvious fact that it would be utterly stupid not to do thishi ive got a great idea were gonna balance the game around skillsatiiso what happens when people train skills to iv or vwho caressince this thread is also utterly stupid i wont be surprised to learn that you dont accept this
dav you misread my post probably because i didnt specify very clearly i meant on a cmb the kinetic damage bonus is weaker than the rof bonus not that it is a weaker bonus period the bonus is weaker than a rof bonus but that doesnt mean its not balanced that just means a rof or rainbow damage bonus could be overpoweredso we dont agree on the fact that the bonus is fine i think its fine i think rainbow bonus to all of the ships are a more powerful bonus and would be a little too muchas for the little s who are trying to say drones are the primary source of dps for a ship and that drones get unfair bonuses consider this max dps for a dominix with heavy drones is somewhere around the 500 dps mark thats about half of the dps megas and hyperions get so the primary and as dav claims the only important dps weapon system is severely low drone boats are not balanced myrmidon can only get like 300 dps from drones while brutix and cane and others can get 600 easily drone boats are not balanced drone boats can use turrets though and get utility highs though so it balances out but dont argue that drone boats get an unfair bonus because they start out with poor damagecaldari have weapon systems that compete with the others they are not underpowered this blatant boost to caldari would not fix caldari and is unnecessary and would make some ships too powerful simply giving them a more powerful bonus would not fix caldaris problems
you see what you have done james consider yourself reported for derailing attempt this thread is for discussing kin bonus on cmbsrelax stil  no one here is proposing a nerf to drone boatsthis is a thread about the kin bonus on cmbs only
nice dodge cant answer my question or somethingi never implied there is anything wrong with drone boats in fact it wasnt even me who brought it up im simply using that as an analogy of what you are doing and im using that to demonstrate how your argument is majorly flawed
oh please some guy a couple pages ago started trying to talk about tankingyou cant seriously think james was trying to derail the thread consider yourself reported for trollingi know nobody is asking for a drone nerf im just saying drones are very hard to compare to missiles and drone bonuses should not be something to base missile bonuses on other than the theoretical situations about blanket boostsnerfs
then stop posting paragraphs justifying drones boats in this threadyour right drone bonuses should not be something to base missiles bonuses onhow we got here was a bit convolutedi asserted that cmb balance against other ships changes as players skill up truedoccia pointed out that the same issue affects drones boats which it does truewe all agree that bonuses affect the overall performance of a boatso why do we need to go charging off down drone boat nerfing thread lane to come back to the same point were at now  we all agree that the difference in size of bonuses can negativelly or positivelly affect ship performance 
no one is actually talking about droneboat balancing i am using it to prove a point just like the powergrid on myrmidon and harbinger example i wasnt actually suggesting that the powergrid on myrmidon should be changed i was using that to make a pointin either case since this is not getting us anywhere ill cut to the chasehere is my pointquoting you directly1 do you agree that different ships may fall in different categories for example the drake may be close to a while the caracal may be close to b2 if so do you agree that different changes should be applied to different ships and not just a blanket change encompassing all of them3a if so please change your op to reflect this3b if not why not
ah i see then why not just ask me that in the first place 1 yes and yes to your example2 no3b because the kinetic bonus affects more than just ship v ship balancethere are issues around the kin bonus that can not be solved by individual ship fixes on a ship by ship basisnamelly  and these issues overlap somewhat 1 experianced players can do 0 more dps than noobs in cmbs  0 value for hull training  in approx 23rds of encounters2 averaged out the kin bonus is less valuable than a rofdpl bonus2a this means that caldari hull training performed by a caldari pilot is less valuable than the hull training done by pilots of other races2b caldari ships can never be balanced at all player skill levels against other races shipswhile this bonus is in use3 the kinetic only bonus clashes with caldari combat tactics  damage selecting  cmb pilots are the only pilots who have to fight without any damage bonusthis is particularilly a problem if you are flying solo in a cmbindividual ship fixes would of course produce a better balanced end result in all ship fixes for a maxed skilled player versus other shipswhat were talking about hereraising the dps bonus from 8 to 25 averagedso on the question of ship balance its equiv to a 17 boost in dps at level 5that sounds like a lotbut im pretty sure most of the cmbs could absorb that kind of increase without becoming opexception to that rule are the drake and maybe the cerbso if this fix goes through i think the majority of cmbs would be better balanced and the cerb might be a little op and the drake would definettely be ome way ahead of other bci dont think its unreasonable for any race to have great shipslet it be the drake for the caldariin the same manner that the mini have the vagasabreruppybroadswordin the same manner that the gal have the taranisishkurvexorthantosin the same manner that the amarr have erm whatever they have geddon  curse  abso that laser beasty dread whos name escapes me atmi honestly cant put my finger on one caldari ship atm and say thats greatthe drake is curently pretty good but harby and cane seem there or thereaboutsbut the drake is still a pants solomobile

i can see your point but your concerns do not hinder the proposal in principle but relate more toward the balancing of how hardeasy it should be to probe wrecks according to the different circumstances wreckcan is in deadspace pocket wreckcan is in open space wreckcan is abandonedthese have to be balanced vs difficulty to scan a mission ship in a deadspace difficulty to scan a mission ship in open spaceimho the difficulty from easy to hard to scan down should be abandoned wreck in open space wreckcan in open space mission ship in open space mission ship in deadspace pocket abandoned wreckcan in mission deadspace pocket wreckcan in deadspace pocket this should insure that it will not become easier to scan down ships in mission sitesdeadspace pockets
supported would turn salvaging more into a real profession instead of the only option to be a salvager being to grief mission runnersabandoned ships being very easy to probe should provide a decent entry point for characters new to the professionscanning
wreck scanning supported container scanning not as long as it doesnt become too easy to scan them eg if a missionrunner disposes of his wrecks by shooting them or salvaging them himself quickly after killing the npcs he should not be probeable
really quickly given how little time you have to get out of a missionescalation once combat probes come out  and if you missed a wreck before youre out congrats your site is compromised at least you still have the option of shooting wrecks as you gothanks for screwing lowsec again garr
1 for this would still be nice to be able to shoot anyone that takes any salvage not abandoned
i could support this if you suggested that wrecks could be probed using combat probes but allowing them to be probed with core probes just presents too many problemshowever if you allow core probes to be used to find abandoned wrecks wrecks that have been explicitly abandoned by the pilot who killed the rat i could go for that toohowever this would make life very difficult for me i make a habit of running missions in dangerous lowsec areas often i have to leave the mission site to hide out while im being probed down  if these guys could just probe my wrecks out theyd do that and then wait for me to return it would be the end of my lowsec missioning id be very unhappyid prefer only allowing abandoned wrecks to be probed and possibly automatically flagging wrecks as abandoned when a mission is completed
i support this idearunning eve on my 2560x1600 dell monitor is terrible on my eyes proportional fonts yes or  larger fonts at least twice as large
my name is bbb and i endorse this message
i cant imagine that this is as easy a change as it seems yeah im that guy because there is so much crammed into the interface making the font larger may blow it upthat said it is an accessibility issue for players with worse vision and the particular font that is being used is difficult to read even for people that can see it it looks cool though
one big problem with this as a reaction to storyline events is that gallente fw has re taken some systems and has held them for a bitthese may be lost next week next month or next year then regained again etc so are ccp going to change them every time the fw situation map changes
they cant really expect people to run haul missions that leave high sec if the cargo is larger than the hold of a ceptor period thats just silly
1also it would be nice if all celestial bodies were correctlysized ie filling the entire screen instead of being marginally larger than a space station
as was stated in some other threads id like to bring up the effects in eve as something that needs to be brought to ccp these could all be kept at strictly client side and henceforth have 0 impact to the servers1 i would like to see an enhancement to the gun and projectile effects as currently the effect really doesnt feel powerful at all were dealing with things up to 1400mm and yet the effect looks much less satisfying as it stands2 explosions its time eve did explosions properly im talking explosions based on the size of the ship with fractured parts that could disappear after a few seconds but atleast a proper explosion with gases venting and you know a proper boom to the ship with cloud and fire etc im sorry but this has been long needed eves explosions as they currently are leave a lot to be wanted even if the floating parts blown apart arent included a proper sized fireball and lingering smoke would be something 2a wrecks why is it every ship wreck is just a weird mangle of metal strips that the icon over the wreck pretty much covers how about we get wreck types we already know the server tracks the size of the wreck so how about a better graphic to show when you know a ship carcas or something3 hull damage oh my god this is probably one of my most hated things in all of eve ever get to hull damage and warp out to say that super gay single ripple of smoke from the back left corner of your ship well i propose a dynamic hull damage model gases leaking from various parts of the ship at 515 damage 1530 damage gas leaks  fires and black smoke and darkened overlay on top of the ship to show damage to the well the hull since its supposedly have taken a beaten i dont see why the hull is sparkly clean with a small smoke stack from it if all the armor is gone and on top of that the hull is at 10 4 finally last but not least on these revisions should be the return or addition of engine trails you know nice little smoke trails from the engines during subwarp travel abs and mwds with their own trail types ab bigger smoke mwd maybe different color smoke this doesnt have to be server side it could be all client side to atleast add to the immersionthis is my first csm proposal so i dont know if i did it right but after reading other threads from eve capsuleers like myself i figured id bring it to the csms attention of how wanted these graphical changes are wanted ok ok the explosions and hull damage were my own annoyances that im adding to the proposal but i cant be the only one that wants to see them improved asap
100 for bringing back engine trails and as long as it can be turned off at will extra eye candy is nice too sok
1 yes but start with hybrid turrets projectiles at least have acs that look good hybrid turrets you often dont even see firing2 yes but dynamic dont want to see it blowing up exactly the same everytimerest just yes
signed especially for 4ideally the list should also include a request for the return of the old cyno effect or some modification thereof and a general introduction of the longpromised particle effects for everything engine plumestrails stargate effects nosneut etc
shield missiles and hybrid graphics hmm once again we see what ccp thinks about caldari the hardener effects on armor tanks have this nice and very visible gold shimmer to it while most of the time i cant even see my ravens shield hardeners unless i really zoom it and pay attention missiles we all agree need something like what the ragnorak titan ddd has nice smoke trails and everything at the very least get rid of the bright light on cruise and torps and give then a really nice smoke trail effect and make missile explosions seem a little better maybe not so big and a little more detailed and hit parts other than just the center of the ship also what the op said about not being able to see hybrids this is so true the neutron blaster effects were so much better before the change when i saw the next blaster effects in the early builds i thought they werent finish but then they made it to the final product and i was very disappointed lasers look better projectiles look betterccp gives use caldari pilots some love 100 supportedwhile im on it return the cyno jump vortex effects and remove the eccm and sensor boosters its very annoying especially on bigger ships where they cover the entire screen of the fleet if youre even zoomed in at a moderate distance
dropping the shiny missle effect for a nice thick smoke trail would be awesomeand your right hybrids do need a bit more love graphically than the acs lolshield impacts should look awesome but ya adding a shield effect would be nice kinda like the armor ones but offset it from the ship itself so that its floating around the ship countored the same as the ships that would look wicked shouldnt be too hard add a invisible layer around the ship using the same design as the hull but transparent that the mask is applied to for the hardener animation and for impacts pulse the area where the impact happens a radial impact to the shields transparency
please get a highres texture for your disproportionaly gigantic torpedo explosion and make it a cyrcle where you cannot see corners
the market is only free within bounds set by ccp to take the example of production ccp sets the number of production slots available at stations and poses and decides how long a job should takein this manner the production capacity of eve is set by ccp and players can compete for a percentage of production capacity this cap on production capacity is an artificial control that prevents major price crashes through over supplywhat im trying to demonstrate here is the absurdity of stating that every other profession gets abandoned to the free market ccp have shown time and again that they will interfere with the market by altering blueprints or changing production methods such as invention or alchemyto return to our mining friends im not saying that they deserve special protection and subsidy im saying they are in a situation where they cant compete with rat loot and that under such circumstances the mineral price floor isnt propping up miners its propping up a bad game mechanicby reducing the isk fountain of rat loot you raise mineral prices raise the price of ships and the whole problem of ships being cheaper than the insurance threshold goes awayalternatively you could reduce all insurance premiums and payouts by 2533 and all we do is nerf miners pay by 2533 and end up in exactly the same stupid insurance situation several months down the linelooking at how much miners earn for the effort they put in id have to ask why do you hate them so much you think their pay needs a nerf
the optimal price is one where grinders can afford to run multiple accounts but its still worth it for pvpers to buy plexes rather than move to a game where they dont have to grind so muchi cant tell you what that optimal price is but id bet a wad of isk that someone at ccp has worked it out as stated earlier in the thread im not a fan of the current insurance mechanism and as such am not trying to make an argument for the current fixed insurance pricesim making an argument that theres a game design imbalance where miners are undercut by ratters and that without fixing this the removal or reduction of the mineral price floor is a huge and unnecessary nerf to the mining industrycare to elaborate on these options available to substitute insurance in order to maintain this mineral price floor it would be nice to hear some fresh ideas on this subjectif the basket price doubles then with my suggestion the burger flipper is sitting pretty because hes the only one who can provide the minerals and as such is well paidwith malcaniss proposal the burger flipper is still being undercut by rat loot so the basket price will never double
1ive always thought that the insurance mechanic was poorly implemented and it hasnt got better since i started playing it needs some serious attention because as it stands now its a joke hell i dont even bother insuring my t2 ships anymore cal
you do know i have consistently supported proposals to reduce or eliminate the mineral content of rat loot over the last 2 years i even mention it in this thread specifically for that reasonbut yes anyway thanks for making it obvious that miners are quite aware that insurance is effectively an npc mineral buy order at levels far above what players are currently prepared to pay go make yet another proposal to reform the mineral content of rat loot and i will support you even though i make my isk ratting and missioning i like the idea of replacing rat loot with meta bpcs that can either be used to build meta items or used directly by inventors to increase their invention chances such that even meta1 pieces have valuei think it would also be a great idea to increase by 1020 the amount of zydrine and megacyte required to build shipsjust to make this explicit  i do not want to see miners nerfed i have long thought that the profession needed some devlove but as part of that love i want to see mining changed from an npcsupported profession to a player supported profession which is also consistent with the other arguments i have made over the yearscare to elaborate on these options available to substitute insurance in order to maintain this mineral price floor it would be nice to hear some fresh ideas on this subjecteg change pos andor pos modules in to playercreated items that will soak up a fantastic amount of minerals

i would desperately love to have ccp start using rsa keyfob authenticators as an additional precaution you could do what we do at work combine the authenticator token code with a preset user supplied pin created at the first use of the authenticator this actually provides four pieces of information the hacker must have1 your username2 your password3 your pin4 your authenticator code which means they have to have the authenticator itself since the codes change every minute on the rsa onesedit yes this should be a optional measure id use it for sure but no one should be forced to

i keep seeing proposals to improve eve visuals i really think that there are more important things to worry about than aestheticsthat said i do like your ideasthe munitions pathing wouldnt be too hard in terms of randomizing a visual for where ammo lands i think the more difficult part would be tying that into the combat system to correctly render missed hits as misses and randomize a munition path for hitsone of the things working against this is that this is an rpg not a space combat sim not saying you cant translate combat graphics appropriately weve all seen any number of games doing it but try to think in that context when approaching entity to entity combat removing selfeffects would be a nice feature and i think would go a long way for newer players or those with poorer eyesight who cant see the overview icons to recognize where an attack was coming fromthe missile hardpoint thing  thats been batted around here for a long time i agree with you but good luckwarp scrambling effects are fine as ismwd and afterburner animations if your target is pushing more than 3k its probably not an afterburner ill support this ticket in the context of youve got some good ideas but im more function over form and performing graphics upgrades is low priority when there are other major features that need fixing first other than keeping your graphics team busy

if i can remotely split stacksi should be able to remotely merge stacks too
if my estimates of ccp as a company are remotely accurate it would hardly be a problem to find the time for thateither way this is a point where i see many ingame rivals agreeing on unanimously so i maintain that it deserves more attention in what way exactly is up to ccp
in my opinion not only code needs being looked into but game mechanics have to change technology will always pose a limit while the current mechanics give the players the opportunity and the motivation to put as many ships as possible on the same objective and lag is inevitable soon or laterhere is my analysis and subsequent proposal
ccp tried to get people onto the test server to identify the problemhunting the lag monsterboth tests were scheduled for pretty bad times 1700 gmt during the workweek but hopefully they found the cause of the lag there is feedback in this thread about the eventpoint is ccp seems to be aware of the problem and working on a solutionthismakes me think they need to come up with a different method for testingthiswas an amusing read  and well deserved criticismfinally thisleaves me thinking they might actually identify the problemsokratesz i really dont think you needed to post this thread though you should already be able to contact ccp about this as you are a member of the csm half the csm has likely been in one of these lagged out fleets  considering the alliances they are in  so get with them and go find out whats going on
supported including a drop in refinery lossreduction in refinery cpuhowever it might also be an idea to think about a faction ore compression pos module that essentially duplicates the rorquals ore compression abilities to balance this this module would have to have a fairly hefty cpugrid use and only provide 12 slots such a compression module is aimed squarely at wh miners but might also find use in 00 and even empire reducing transport overhead
well id say that ore created the rorqual so they wouldnt have to build a pos although i believe that rorquals would be more efficient in deep space assignments than this tower however this pos isnt a bad idea
if youre referring to what i think you are thank your allies a they love to shrink grids normal grids arent that bad
the same way a server knows it needs to resend a packet when the packet is lost  the clients send countless confirmations back to the server already for everything the server sends themelegant solutions1 dont spawn the ship into the new grid until the client confirms it has loaded2 use the jump cloak feature when entering a grid that is heavily loaded have the timer equal to expected load timeim fairly confident that part of the issue comes from the logs in the new fleet thing perhaps it would be wise to not send notifications for client logs until the client has loaded the grid ive been watching this in fleets recently that lovely rubberbanding effect seems to happen about the same time as everyone and their sister is broadcasting warpalign to and need reps often start flooding all at the same time as everyone is trying to load the grid impatient people that we are when people in fleet dont see everyone warp right away some have been known to spam the warp to button similarly when people are dying and not being instantly repped they have been known to spam the need reps button perhaps putting a short timer on those buttons would help for everyone elses sanity at leasti know a goon didnt just complain about another alliance playing grid mechanics games i vividly remember being in a fleet where the goon fc told everyone to jet single units of ammo as much as possible just before an enemy fleet jumped in to attack a station none of the alliances really should point fingers when it comes to grid games
the magic grid fu document was written by goons for goons
the stores a nice idea horribly implemented this isnt a gameplay issue so theres really no proposal to be made here i just want csm to release a statement saying something along the lines ofthe eve store has some nice things sales would easily go up if you ran it differently shipping costs are ridiculously high fed exing something halfway around the world to a third world country costs less then eve store shipping shipping times range from a few weeks to countless monthsgtc time codes should not be a physical product with a shipping cost almost equal to the item and a weeks long wait on topplease look into options concerning the improvement of the store in these and other areas
all my thumbsand while were at it fix everything else thats wrong with setting up and maintaining a pos like alliance anchored modules
there is hundreds of things that need to be improved on with player owned stationsa total and complete from the ground up overhaul is in order
some of your proposals are still not fully defined and explained obviously its not as simple as you think it is or you would have explained it properly ill try to explain what information you still need to provide1 you have not explained or at least written it into the final proposal how scan probes and multiroom missions interact what happens if i scan down a mission runner in room 3 of a mission and press warp where do i end up entry gate current room 2 last cleared room room 3 where he is or room 3 on top of him2 you still have not explained if or how this enables a friendly fleet member to warp in to salvage behind you its been asked before too if warp to fleet drops him on your head he cant find room 1 you have to warp him back no time saving if warp to fleet drops you on room 1 like it does now this feature does nothing3 this will have no time increase for competent mission runners who dont warp out of missions angel extravaganza level 4 with bonus room takes less than 37 minutes at least admit that its a boost to beginner runners only4 so granted that its no benefit to higher end runners and allows for griefers to warp into missions more easily and the fact that most missioners die when they engage ninjas ninja plural they always have hidden friends how is this not a boost to the griefing of less competent mission runnersim not saying thats bad but youve completely ignored the cons as in pretended they dont existif anything a better idea would be to reduce gate distances ccp has already done this one some missions i think one of the serpentis level 4 used to have a 90 km ride but its shorter nowanother proposal that needs further clarification rather than your random personal attacksalternative to bookmarks makes no sense so you are proposing instead of warping to bm you are going to mwd millions of kilometers to the next room what distance are you proposing the rooms are moved to werent you trying to avoid the long travel times in the first placeyou admit since rooms are not locked by gates how to do you stop people bypassing rooms its more than that though its griefers beating the mission runner to the objective and denying it this is jeremy tacs all over again ive mentioned him before you should find out what his mission is all aboutim also pretty sure it boosts pvp fits and we all know how bad at pvp mission runners areok but ccp knows you dont really need to propose this they know their game needs better graphics and they do update them a little each patch

ok lets pretend that all proposals in this forum are thorough and detailed as you pretend they be even if i already covered the questions youre asking here1 scanning is unchanged whoever scans finds the first room of course if they gate into an unlocked room theyd be able to warp in there if they bookmark warp out and warp back in to bookmark2 fleet dynamics remain unchanged whoever gates into mission space for the first time will have to run through the gates3 there will be no mission time increase of any kind and in no situation its in fact all the contrary everybody would be able to benefit from mission bookmarks if theyd so desire of course if you dont have a reason to bookmark and warp out this addition doesnt benefit you4 these assumptions are plain wrong its simply idiotic to even think that you or anybody else canalwaysaccept a missionrun itfinish itwithout interruptionoh well you as in anybody might be one of those basement gremlins that doesnt have a social life but otherwise people for example have friends relatives bathroom needs and similar and at some point you will leave a mission if you mainly pve of course and will surely be grateful that you dont have to pass every single gate back in when you can bookmark your cleared roomsits all of the contrary in fact unexperienced mission runners will know that its ok to warp out quickly since they will have the option to return to mission when they have refitted or better prepared for example losing mob aggro much quicker than beforeindeed there are no contrary points all of them exist already and for every disadvantage theres an outweighting benefit5 does make sense instead if bookmarks arent allowed at least allow people to travel to the next gate using an mwd afterburners are aok but a battlecruiser still takes ages to cover 30 kilometers6 rooms are still locked by gates the only advantage is that if you clear the room you can bookmark and warp in laterregarding pvp carebears would have a better card to play since itd take a just a pretty quick refit you could run missions with scramblers core stabilizers etc in your cargo to get back in mission space to face your grieferspvp gets a boost and carebears have a better chance to defend their missionsthose are simply good and deserve approval i sure know that i like better fight graphics rather than better planet graphics for exampleps my witty and possibly annoying comments are just a response to imbecility

then i propose amarr and gallente switch bonuses cool see how you like having worthless bonuseson a serious note so because the bonuses do not 100 deal with tanking you think its imbalanced drones have the most lol rigs in game they is no implants to help drones drones can be killed easyum cross train to gallente go pvp some with blasters and rails and then come back and let me know what you think
ccp have already said theyll do this  it was in the minutes of the most recent ccpcsm meeting nevertheless supported again
yes i do what part of my post said i didnt  were you just hoping for a gotcha moment because i dont agree with you  sorry i use the ds with overview settings unchecked just like you and i scroll down just like you and i manage fine without the scrolling ie with a probes in overview setting you may as well just have a big red sign pop up and say probes in system for all the effort required again not supported
good idea
absolutely supported
you mean like doomsday weaponssuddenly gets pelted with rotten fruit
damn i was gonna guess a supernova missile
because of course those actually worked to decrease blob warfare at all
no it made blobs worse not better the only antiblob weapon that has worked so far are stealthbombers
false neither worked
there are other activities aside from ship scanning that require extensive use of fine degeee scanning just sayin
supported i think it would also be nice to optionally put down a little circle down the boresight so you know where the dscans pointed rather than guessing
im pretty certain this will fall under the review price ceilings proposal that is already in discussion though ultimately it will depend how ccp view these structures did they intend them as an isk sink for example

very happy to see my proposal pass and no objections regarding the change to use combat probes rather than core probesthe salvage profession is already a very low skill intensive profession so urging ppl to get combat probes will not hinder the proposal in generalmy original reason behind using core probes for wrecks was to even further increase the gap between salvagers and mission griefing salvagers as the pure salvager would not be able to find mission ships at all thus would only very very rarely find an active mission spotalso see my post about the difficulties regarding being able to scan down wreckscans vs ships in mission deadspace pockstopen spacedifficulty order of scanning from easy to hard 1 abandoned wreck in open space 2 wreckcan in open space 3 mission ship in open space 4 mission ship in deadspace pocket 5 abandoned wreckcan in mission deadspace pocket 6 wreckcan in deadspace pocket

love the new planets but this  cooler ship explosions you know epic ship breaking up animations for big ships are my top two graphics complaints in eve and have been for a long timecan we please please get some love for the capital jump effects
theres a difference between weaker poor and inadequate i think everyone agrees that the 5 kinetic damage bonus is weaker  but most of us believe that it is neither poor nor inadequatecompare a 10 damage bonus with a 5 damage bonus sure the 5 damage bonus is weaker but that doesnt make it poor or inadequatethe poor or inadequate label can only be applied when taking all other ship attributes into account and comparing the sum of those to the sum of the attributes of all other ships this you flatly refuse to allow into the discussionyour premise is that the bonus is inadequate not that it is weaker unfortunately you use these two ideas equivalently the change you suggest does not follow from the bonus simply being weaker time and time again people are disagreeing with your premise yet still agreeing that the bonus is weaker and you take them to be hypocrites if you change munitions youre choosing not to use your bonus youre not losing it
if a bonus was a fixed value i would agree with your statementcomputation of some sort  whether sumation or multiplication or whatever  would be required to properly evaluate there value in isolation from other ship attributeswhats clear about nearly all bonuses is the fact that they are granted as percentagesthe great thing about percentages is they take into account the base performanceeg a blaster boat doing 500dps at hull 0 does 625dps at hull 5 a laser boat doing 400 dps at hull 0 does 500dps at hull 5so a blaster boat does  500  400   125  25  more damage than a laser boat at skill 0a blaster boat does  625  500   125  25  more damage than a laser boat at skill 5it is not neccessary to look at all the base attributes of both the laser boat and the blaster boat to evaluate the effectivness of the bonusso no i dont agree with your statement that all aspect of everything needs to be researched to reach the conclusion that a weeker bonus is a poorer bonusbecause both are expressed as a percentage they can both be evalutated in isolation from ship statsboth the kin bonus on cmbs and rofdpl on others are percentageseg they boost there respective ships based on the ship base performance as in the exampleso in this case a weeker bonus is a poor bonus
the thing is the drake is already a good ship currently everyone and their mother seems to have a drake and it is probably percentagewise the most popular ship in eve it does not require a buff period in order for me to support your suggestion you must address this problem like i said a couple pages back i have no problem with you buffing most of the ships you listed but there are some that i have issue withoh and sorry but i must point out the flaws in your argumenttrue but consider thismegathron has 5 damage per levelarmageddon has 5 rof per levelfor example the armageddon does 500 dps at hull 0  5263 dps at hull 1 53 dps increase from the previous level 5556 dps at hull 2 56 dps increase from the previous level 5882 dps at hull 3 59 dps increase from the previous level 625 dps at hull 4 625 dps increase from the previous level 6667 dps at hull 5 667 dps increase from the previous levelthe megathron does 600 dps at hull 0 20 more dps than geddon 630 dps at hull 1 197 more dps than geddon 660 dps at hull 2 188 more dps than geddon 690 dps at hull 3 173 more dps than geddon 720 dps at hull 4 152 more dps than geddon  750 dps at hull 5 125 more dps than geddonthis discrepancy exists for all ships with rof and damage bonuses now you saidokay lets see how you prove rof and dpl ships are balanced without evoking any of their other attributes please try ill welcome itif you cant then do you concede that if we follow your argument then we must rebalance every single ship with discrepancies in the percentage of their bonuses
you know something dude you are quite rightrof and dpl are not equal bonusesi have always known that rof was not exactly the same as dplif you go back and read some of my earlier post i state the kin bonus in terms of dpl and acknoledge the small difference in rofdpl by using the approx symbol dude i had no idea rof was so much more powerful than dpldrone bonuses 50 more dps at level 5rof bonused weapons 33 more dps at level 5dpl bonused weapons 25 more dps at level 5kinetic only bonus 8 more dps at level 5i really do need to go and review and correct the opupdate it for dominion pirate vessels no longer gettin the kin bonus as well while im therethanks dude for bringing this travesty to my attention

i had a similar idea re spreading combat across an entire constellation at once titans would actually be the logistical ships that ccp intend them to be by bridging reinforcements around as required
i have a simpler suggestion move sbus to the other side of the gatesay you have a system with five gates now instead of simply having 3 sbus on gates in the system and therefore can move your blob quickly when one gets attacked you have to decide if you want to jump through and engage the hostile fleet attacking sbu 1 and wait out the gate jump aggro timer which may or may not be a bait to make sbu 2 and 3 more vulnerable
i think current soverenity of one system should be kept however since its not the small aliencescorps holding system or two but the giants that produce lag while fighting we need an additional level of soverenity for constelation that would provide real benefit maybe we should di in that direction and see what we can come up with

ccp may have intended for 00 to become more densely populated but everyone and their neighbour knew that was never going to happen alliances have shed redundant systems but still own them since they can clobber anyone who tries something funny  the concept was declared dead early on in testing discussions road to hell and good intentions if ccp is unable to sort out the lag issues then something like this is pretty much mandatory not sure how this would play out having problems seeing it in the minds eye some points did pop up though how do you propose contesting sovereignty should work if constellation based you still need some way of tagging the systems to tally themusing current system the defender would have a massive advantage over an attacker as he has to anchor sbus everywhere and guard all or most of them while fighting bridgesjammers unless all systems are reinforced in one fell swoop you will invariably end up with the kitchensink being thrown at the last few systems taking us right back to the nodedeathlag problemneeds some ironing out of the details but otherwise a novel approach that might do the trickps perhaps add some way anchored module for an attacker to disrupt bridgescynos temporarily 1hr or so

more shiny is generally a good thing i dont know from projectiles personally but blasters could definitely use from lovethe current explosions seems pretty decent to me at least on my system it looks like a big puff of gas with an expanding cloud of metalliclooking dustwrecksi tend to just gobble up but i have to admitit would be kinda neat if my mission rooms looked more like the graveyard pois when i got doneand thorax hulls just dont look right without the massive band of engine trails that was the best partas for the hull damage itd be better if it was a bit more dynamic but as for only showing one small smoke stackits actually more realistic that way for example heres a picture of a real wwii german tiger ii tank thats been killed see if you can spot the damage

1 if ppl are selling ships below value and i can make money by selfdestructing i do it insurance makes it easier to cover losses from pvp only change to insurance should be that there is no payout when conkkorded
yes thats exactly the problem please try and see past your own immediate narrow selfinterest
i suspect that if we removed insurance payouts on concord kills and self destructs that wed see insurance becoming a straight out isk sinkliang
speaking for myself active in 00 as i am its been a decent net positive lately about 130140 mill this year so far
speaking for myself insurance has cost me a few bil over the course of my time in evelianged hell suicide ganking with a t1 fit thorax costs about 3m  even fully insured factoring in namedt2 modules and i doubt youve made isk off of dying

just plain old good sense

the problem is currently the server doesnt know the grid hasnt loaded on the clientwhen experiencing the grid load issue rightclicking in space doesnt produce any menu
supported but in my opinion we will always experience lag in very important fights due to the current mechanic we need a change in game mechanics that solves this problem once for all and compels forces to split on different solarsystems here is my proposal
this can mean two things either that missing killmails have been fixed or that malformed mails have been fixedso potentially we got 2 out of 4 issues fixed
considering the fix for warping sideways seems a bit halfbaked im worried about the killmails now anyone have postpatch killmails to suggest the fix was a success
i like ccps rules against non eve related signatures on the forums but they are missing something important animated signatures are often annoying unpleasant and lacking in good tastei want to see others signatures just no animated signatures
annoying unpleasant and lacking in good taste are all a matter of taste personal preference is not a good reason to change how things work

i do like this idea but i would merge this with the current dead horse thread as this would fall under that umbrella
now with the mothership buff in it would be a good idea to bring back lowsec dds

until there is better solution to station camping capital in low sec this would do it
kallandra must have a station camping capital in lowsecyes

as a producer i support anything that results in more dead carriersedit forgot to tick support whoops
1 to support
its nothing but stupid that a directed energy weapon that puts the agressor voulnerable shouldnt be allowed to be in use anywhere the ship can be deployed fully supported
why dont see why you woulndt want dds in low sec  its no longer a grid wide effect so theres no reason not to have them
i cant see this being abused against small gangs at all i suppose its not any more powerful than the ability to bridge in a bs fleet liang
death all station hugging carriers
last i heard it takes 10 dds to kill the buffed motherships which leads me to conclude that you dont give a rats arse about the motherbuff but want dds for everything elseit would be a step backwards which is a bad thing forward would be do remove mothers from lowsec instead with no triage they have zero purpose in lowsec other than the lamepiratecamping scenariosremove supercapitals from lowsec and there is no problemtldr not supported
you are missing the point the issue is that titans could dd mothershipssupercarriers before they hp buff wich was supposed to be in dominion 10 now that they cant get ddd them alone it should be reintroduced to low sec for titans the initial issues was that people lost several billion in 10 sec as apposed to now if people are willing to commit 500 bill to kill a supercarrier in 10 sec making their 500 bill voulnerable for 10 min every time they should be allowed to same stands to killing piratestation ganking dreadscarriers if a titan pilot is willing to commit his ship to kill a cheap normal caps are cheap ship they should be allowed to its a directed must aquire lock to fire weapon and not an area of affect so it should be able to use it everywhere it can be deployed
seems reasonable
no more stationhugging capitals and faction bs
lets kill the chance for smaller corporations and alliances to live in lowsec by using our giant omgwtfpwn deathlaser dont give me any crap about hics no support also titans are for 00 not for lowsechowever i support the end of station camping not with this though
you raise some valid points and i think the csm could raise them to ccp profitably supported
and make eon magazines available as pdfswould probably increase the sales of eon by around 10 times
i was going to buy a couple books from eve store empyrean age in particular i changed my mind when shipping turned out to cost 3 times as much as the book itself srsly who who charges 30ish dollars for transporting goods that wigh 300 gramms btw neither book nor timecodes are not exactly hightech good could be produced on eurasian continent as well for relatively cheat ya know
it is a bit better other than short warps you warp in aligned correctly now however you still warp sideways as this short video i made after the patch shows
video made me lol
i also support this ideaid love to see medium and large tractor beams in the gameas a rookie pilot i find no sense in training for a marauder or an orca just for the tractor bonus since all i want is to salvage my missions with a little less annoyancelong live tractor beams
i dont see how this would be useful except to gallente rp fanatic corps who only fly gal boatmost fleets i see are pretty mixedyour right that the info links are poorest of the 4 types and therefore the eos is a useless commandbut i think a better replacement would be a damage linksie links that increase the dps of all weapons systemsso all ships in mixed fleets can benefitand the eos is no longer a useless piece of crudmake the damage links bonus them to the eosastarte so that the gal spec warfare becomes damage rather than infokeep the info links just not bonused on any command
that might work better if you want four turret links the bonuses you want are likely cap use for amarr optimal for caldari tracking for gallente and falloff for minmatarthough those last two can be switched fits racially covers all the nondps stats and they should all be fairly balancedthough the optimal range one will probably have to have a lower number on it than the others im not opposed to more gangboosting equipment i think some of it could be pretty cool as long as youre careful to ensure that you dont wind up with a ship in a fleet being three times as effective as one not and that all of them are usable at least in some narrow circumstances i think you might be able to do better with a new class of ships for the roleflagship t2 bses or just more command ships but thats not a moral stance just my intuition i just dont think that it pays for us to get too ambitious and ask for things that ccp cant possibly deliver
i wish they would introduce a new ship that was a bit bigger than a bs and could run say the 3 current links 1 of the new proposed combat oriented link and had the passive bonus of what the titan gives gangs sure make it cost like 35 hundred mill or whatever making it only worth taking out in big fleets but also dont allow it to be a pwn mobile maybe make it only good vs light support to maybe medium also throw in a large cargo bay to carry lootcap 800s
csm has recently passed a proposal to look at info warfare links and boost the eos as a separate issue i dont like all of this particular proposal for reasons other people have posted but perhaps one of the three info links could give a drone control or hp bonus control range would fit with them being information links you could make a case for the shield and armour resistance links to apply to drones  i still think sensor integrity is something useful for a gang but not sure which of the other two should go to give a drone bonus instead

guys you do not have to live in wh space when you enter you should understand that it is a dangerous place and should plan accordinglypeople need to stop appeasing to ccp when something doesnt go absolutely perfect for them suck up a few losses and learn how to plan ahead and work to combat the issues that plague you apparently being gankedi cant stand the constant movement to make eve easier and easier for the record i live in a wh and both gank and get ganked grow up and use the tools youre given if we are going to make a change like this might as well give in local back i cant stand players like you

good troll thread 1010
supported this wont be a popular idea among the gankers but it needs to happen
not supported at all
youre right it does need to happen while we are at it imo it is very hard to look through local if you have an active war deccan you also implement a system where a huge popup comes up if there is in fact a war target in local i mean its just so i dont have to scroll through the already available information in order to determine if there is a threat thanks
two thumbs up
public missions as stated are posted up on a central board at agent stations in certain systems anyone can come along and help on these missions these are basically cooperative in highsec where everyone signing up will be on the same side for example gallente pod pilots attacking a caldari fleet in luminaire everyone can just turn up an lend a hand in the mission and gets a share of the reward lp and isk and standing at the end as long as they have the mission this could be handled as a rarer event or have multiple different public missions going on in a system at once to make it a more regular occurrencein lowsec and fw areas people can sign up to fw  lawkeeping public missions on different teams depending on where they sign up or what militia they belong too these missions can serve as great set pieces for both conflicts with wannabe cops facing off against pirate players over a drugs cache or gallente players defending an npc supercarrier against caldari oncomersthese mechanics have been proven to work in other mmos are are great fun why not in eve they are a great way to get average joes to interact with other players on many levels
this is something along the lines of warhammer onlines public quest system it seems they were a pretty cool innovative feature for mmos too bad that game flopped so bad it had some very new and cool features id like to see other new mmos steal while i dont pve much myself and i never do missions i think this could be a great addition to the game making the universe feel more alive and vibrant with npcs actually doing things especially in highsec i think this could also help new players meet other new players and join into real player run corporations instead of stagnating in the noob corp until they get bored and quit needs to be fleshed outthey need to be cyclic ie i dont want to see the same static community quests in the same system id like to see them spawn randomlybut other wise supported
first of all cross posting in fi and here is kind of badand this sounds pretty similar to faction warfare
aha but thats where your wrong my friend fw is generic this will focus combat to set peices of pvp that will give free floating milita members and corps a series of concrete objectivesas well as providing some much needed interaction with other players for mission runners who usually lead pretty lonely lives
just like using the forums you should be able to retract your bid from contractsif you find something cheaper than what you are bidding on something for and nobody else bids higher than you have to go through the hassle of reselling and you might not be able to make your money backeasy thing i think to incorporate
or you could just properly research your contracts
looks like after dominion 11 rogue drones sounds were added exceptionally noisy and meaningless makes headachelooking into settingsaudio i was unable to find a way to disable this or all environment sounds but leave turretsdrones and etc sound onso i think it would be nice for ccp to look into their sound settings and separate different sounds turretsdamage module effects npcgates around so they can be fine tuned
yes for separation of effects but do not touch rogue drones they are the single coolest npc in entire eve universe espeshially storiline wise i would like to see more infected ships not only dominixes with tentacles but please caldary ships after all they where made by gallente could be a little nuisance for longhated enemies
if you dont like how they spent your money stop giving it to them
back off start your own development companyp
ccp also spend money on advertising but i already play the game why should i pay for them to advertise instead of developing the game furtheroh wait that argument is as bad as the opsccp are free to spend your subscription on anything they like as long as the servers keep runningalso the csm deal with eve issues dust is not eve or even out yet and the link between the two has yet to be revealed

i must say that the old effects for capital jumping looked indeed cooler and considerably more epic than current small flashes
sounds good to me a dronefighter maintenance deck but it should be slower than using remote reppers and it should fix everything hull and armor damageslower than remote reppers because the maintenance deck can do more drone at once than the remote repsalso would recommend that after a drone is repaired that it is ejected back to drone bay that way you dont have people damaging drones and piling them into the maint deck and then filing the drone bay using the maint deck as extra storageelectrical and mechanical and repair paste  consumed based on damage type and amount
ive been wanting something like this since starting the game in corp channel i dont need to see the portraits of my corpmates and in local i dont care what people look like besides with the way my ui is setup i can now only see 3 with portraits enabled anywayssupported
supporting  1920x1200 i still need moar screen real estate anything to reduce the screen space taken up by various parts of the ui is good for me i know it isnt a lot of space but i prefer to have multiple sets of chat windows on screen local corpalliancefleet friendsinteletc would be nice to knock 323232 pixels off of that with the removal of the portraits
ive wanted this for quite some time as well supported
even when that option is not selected the game will still load portraits if you show info on a ship with a pilot in itwhat someone looks like in this game is wholly irrelevant and having the option to never see a portrait or having that stupid wasted space showing a  on a ui which is already the least efficient in its use of space would be nice
caldari love please
so ive been messing around in 00 providence for a bit and have been setting up onclose gate bookmarks for bombing runs on gatesonly issue is in the organization of said bookmarks no matter how cleverly i name them i will occasionally mess up and hit the wrong one or even worse misjudge where one is in space and decloak on someone who is hanging in the area causing most embarrassing ship lossin the solar system map view bookmarks show up as pins in space that you can warp to convenient for midsystem perchesdscan points but you cannot zoom in close enough to a gate to see which one is 30km from the gate aligned right up for where ships arrive from the outpost in the system etcetcetcwhat i would like to propose is that ongrid bookmarks show up in space as they do in the solar system map view and of course react with the same right click we all know and love
sounds like a good simple idea
supported for fear of iteron on dscan
very much in favour of this as long as we have the option to turn showing them on and off
please make it an option because some people may not want tons of bookmarks in space but yes a good idea
this
sound good just add it as a overview option so it can be enableddisabled with an overview tab
i like it  and for bears that whine about all about pirates keep in mind this would help you align to a safespot as well i dont see why they shouldnt be part of the overview as well and interact as sort of private objects in space
as self proclaimed carebear and providence resident i still agree with this not everyone is here to boost his own playstyle however remember that he said only on grid and remember that if you want to allign to a safespot you just make one near a planet can be 100k km away will still work for alligning but it is just a terrible ui that now forces you to try to describe your bookmark location which really is crappy around gates and stations now if the pirates would see beyond getting as many easy ganks as possible and would support probes on directional scanner
i support this and im probably going to be one of his targets somedayit would also be very cool if you could add bookmarks to your overview

i have to agree with magnus here as much as i love my drones having a domi pilot on a second account i see too much automation capable by the ops ideas the mining idea presented screams legalized mining botters to mei would like to see the drone window improved to relay better information such as drone damage while in bay and key commands for dronerelated functions like launching but i cant support thisnot supported
way to screw over gallente ccp while i support new fw content this is the worst possible way to add itin the meantime i would suggest the sisters of eve to anyone who actually needs gallente standings as they will give secondary standings increase with the federation without attempting to send you on suicide missions
that is actually a possible easy downgrade of my proposal but i think that in the end it poses anyway more load on the node of interest while my proposal gives more spreading that we actually need to fix engagements with 1350 players that now actually occuri think that with my proposal we could actually fix lag for combat of all the sizes we see in 00 today and in the next future while your downgraded version is not giong in my opnion to solve the problem once for allbtw your porposal is much faster to implement and thats what makes it interesting
well saidi dont suggest the sov itself to be based on constellation but the sov contesting mechanic if you want to contest the sov you have to conquest the entire group of systems and when the enemy lost you can share this group of stars with you friends just putting there your tcusuhm my idea is to simply replicate the fight in one system in many copies so if the current system is balanced my proposal should be balanced too if you say that bridges and cynojammer give too many advantages to defenders in these situation i would suggest 2 solutions if a system is contested the defender must chose what to keep online either the cynojammer or the jumpbridgereduce the hitpoints of cynojammers and jumpbridges so that they become easier to disable the cynojammerjumpbridge has proven itself very strong in history maybe overpowered in my proposal where mobility is critical this combination would become even more powerful as you pointed out so suggest to look at iti have a system in my mind that is quite complicatedsome points about itall structures all around the constellation will come out of reinforcement mode at the same time and enter it at the same timecombat ends and the whole constellation enter reinforcement when in all system a point is reached when the present mechanic reinforces the system anyway this will not allow the attacker to destroy an ihub or conquer a station in the first round when the ihub or station are damaged to the amount that now causes them to enter reinforced mode they become invulnerable but repairable if the constellation is not in reinforced mode if some of the necessary sbus are lost in combat attacker has 12 hours from the destruction time to anchor and put online some otherseen how may people are there in a fight today i would suggest to use as conquest unit a group of not less than 3 systems if i am right the least constellations have 5 systems so i suggest to split constellation into some group made of 3 to 5 stars over which the proposed mechanic could be appliedif we want fights with more strategical dept where intelligence of strategists really count the bigger the space is the better i think there will be a sort of high command that issues order to fleet field commanders in different solarsystems
great idea
i dont think so much that sov should be decided by multiple targets across a constellation as sov is suppose to be about taking a system owning a constellation just shows the capabilities of an alliance i think however that the current sov mechanic should be tweaked that attacking multiple systems at the same times offers a greater chance of success over blobing a single system the way i see it is that sov is designed around attacking undefended structures with an extremely large amount of ehp therefore to maximize success an fc will try to get as much dps as possible to a single target because attempting to split their forces say across two or three systems would put them at a disadvantage because of the type cost and risk heres how i see itthe attacker has to online the sbus and reinforce the outposts and tsus they need to consider how much dps they need to defend the sbus reinforce the outposts and tsus and defend against the defenders fleetthe defender has to consider how much dps is needed to successfully take on the sbus the attacking fleets defending themright now because it takes so much time to online an sbu and the structures have a lot of hp and the alliance only as but so many ships they can commit to a fight the risk of attempting to attack several systems at the same time is too high as the defender alliance may also have the same total number of ships they can commit but will have enough time to take on the attacking fleets who have decided to split their fleets before even a single system is put into reinforce or captured therefore the attacker will consolidate all their forces into one location which will mean the defender will have to which means epic blob what needs to be done is the cost and defensive capabilities of the sov structures need to be recalculated so that it becomes more favorable for an attacking alliance to split there forces across possibly three or more systems so that unless the defender really wants to defend a particular system they will split up their forces because attempting to take on the all the systems one by one will mean that they will not have enough time to save all of their systems
defenders are having it pretty rough of late just look at the current wars going on i am beginning to think that the node lag is actually working to the significant favor of the attackers specifically because defense fleets are formed after an attacking fleet is already in the target system more often than not the only time when this is reversed is when a defender has ample time to form a defense fleet before the attacker arrives primarily when they have a spy in place to identify when and where an attacker is going really defenders do need a bone thrown their way i mean were in the game to enjoy the battles not to plant a continuous stream of sov structures
we agree on the last part of your statement but tell me how you can untie those two aspect the need for the attacker to fight on many system to conquer only onei think we agree that with current mechanic neither the defender nor the attacker have to think about such things for reasons stated here such reasoning will never happen with any non invasive change unless we split fights on may solar systems spreading forces on may solarsystem makes mobility an issue and oblige our strategist to think more deeply on what they are doing at start the attacker will have the bonus of the first move if he plays smart and he has to bring to the party at very consistent force if he wish to win greater or equal to the defender it has always worked this way and always will if he has to online sbus keep them online or retry to online them again in many solarsystem he must split his forces because he must be ready to fight whenever the defender decides to attack sbus or to repair outpost or ihubright now the penalty for the attacker in case the defender succeed in destroyingofflining enough sbus is too harshif the attacker is not forced to split his forces he simply wont do it even if the hp of sov related structures are reduced because the benefits of focus fire are too sharpps im not an english native speaker so my opinion is not worth so much but can you reduce the lenght of your sentences it would make them easier and faster to understand

oh of course i havent made isk off dying  a t2fit bs with trimarks has about 5060 mill of unrecoverable loss on it but ive made money from insurance paying 19m to get 60m back
tldr all 6 pagessupport the op at least a quickfix is neededmy idea for a permanent solution1 remove insurance in concord deaths suicide ganking is just silly now days2 the insurance is calculated from the price of minerals needed to build a ship but those prices are fixed to a value ccp set many years agoso how about ccp update those mineral values to actual average mineral values maybe quarterlymaybe set the insurance value of the ship to the average price of the ship that would make t2t3 insurable  and i havent given that much thoughtas for suicide ganking my corpmate was ganked by a geddon with t1 fit i think that guy made money from dying and from the loot drop he didnt eaven try to scan the industrial to see if it was worthwile because if the indy is empty and drops a single t2 cargo expander its money in the pocket thats just silly wheres the risk reward ratio of suicide ganking if you make money from dying and everything else is just a bonus
this is essentially the tldr of the thread except that we were thinking of something more like a 7day rolling average sale price no need to remove concord payouts just set the insurance at 8590 of insurance value and the problem pretty much takes care of itself
this would be very nice supported
sure i would also enjoy more items available only in the pirate lp stores which may or may not require removing a few items from the empire lp stores pirate agents available in lowsec space lowsec is supposed to be a hive of scum and villany no
i support this and also thismakes so much sense
dominion 11 brought a whole bunch of awesome stuffbut also one particular thing that affected alot of people but according to ccp from this threadsmall number of playerswhere do you get those stats from secret ingame system loggingalso i do believe complexity and time is better than we just make it easier on ourself simply because the more people who get more options between crappy graphics good graphics and fps will be happier peoplein fast i propose we should have more graphic optionslowhigh settings just doesnt cut it for a modern game it was mid90s we only had the option to choose between high and low graphics it doesnt belong in 2010
uh dude im willing to bet that the numbers are that low for me i was either running high or low dualboxing this affects 00 of my current eve time medium shader was pretty bad in all honesty anyway it was either too consuming cpugpu wise or it wasnt enough id rather they cut down on their current workload than add to it i give kudos to this it means more ingame stuff and less fluff that barely no one uses also i do believe complexity and time is better than we just make it easier on yourself  wrong if their people who work on the shading have to do less work on a single item then it means more items faster
based on the number of whines about this i would say ccps numbers are pretty much spot on the people who have been affected are angry naturally but there doesnt seem to be any real outcry about the thing im against adding more graphics options like this since it causes so much work and people dont seem to use them i would prefer that more new things are actually done on the graphics front and less time spend on maintenance work having just two options isnt exactly great though but continual development means you actually have to maintain those options so such extra features should be vulnerable to removal because of lack of users this has happened to many other features too for the same reason during my time here so i dont think there is anything special about this decision
its 1 thread with what 10 repliesthe eve playerbase is afaik over 200000if cutting medium graphics means that ccp can use more time neglecting miners and working on other things thats fine with me
a game that lacks a lot of advanced graphic options is now removing some this makes a lot of sense medium shaders offered a balance
you can read all about it herethe chains of the supercap
i agree supercap pilots not that i am one should be able to leave those ships without fearing them being stoleni would propose letting them be anchorable inside a pos shield and only password protectable when anchorediow you can set the password but it only prompts you for one when its anchoredmaybe give poss a new module supercap mooring facility so within 3k m of that or whatever you can anchor the supercaphowever in general i support the idea of letting people play the game their way
methods exist for even solo players to protect their supercaps while i see where the op is coming from it is dumbing the game down and making it easier for people who should know better anyway
this supported
so far every method save the safespot one which ive been advised is too risky to really use  dont know if thats good advice i mean to test it requires the use of alts in some waysince ccp states that alts should not be required to play the game a fix is in my opinion neededthat could be anchoring that could be more pos options one that you could set up with greater restrictions  such as only the anchorer could enter or some such or it could be something like a mooring facility password or something else entirelyright now though the standard is that you get an alt who can barely fly the thing and then log off with the alt flying it and only log him in when you want to use itgiven that is the standard and very few folks seem to do anything else it would seem to me that more options are neededmind you  maybe other people do other things that dont need alts and i just dont know about them if so by all means please share
actually thats a bad idea no alliance would think twice about throwing their entire cap fleet at a pos camping it 247 for the few days it takes to come out of reinforce then melting both the pos and the anchored titanthis idea would simply become a way for titans to be used as bait to lure out an enemy cap fleetnegative how do you make money if you have only one character and a supercap you dont leaving such a ship without a pilot in it even in a super deep safespot has far more risk than any possible reward from current money making methods in the game you have to have an alt to sit in it or simply use an alt as the pilot which is what most people dothis is what it all boils down to if alts arent required if ccp doesnt want shared accounts if ccp doesnt want rl money to be a component of getting such a ship simply put you have to have an alt that does nothing but fly the supercap every once in a while when it is needed give them a way to hide while your character does something else that doesnt require an alt
i suggest you detail the proposal in here instead of just linking to a post in another forumthat out of the way nobody is forcing you to get into a supercap in the first place if you have 1590 billion to drop on a supercap then it isnt a stretch to suggest you buy a second account with isk to park it on you can even buy a ready made alt to avoid the training timeall ships have pros and cons one of the cons of a supercap is that they cannot dock in stations and thus either have to be left vulnerable at a pos or have a pilot in it at all timessupercaps are not supposed to be available to everyone and that is reflected in the level of commitment required when getting in to onebut you can play the game without an althowever nowhere does it say you can do everything in game without other peoplealts to support you
yes but all the pros and cons are in game this is the only one that stretches outside of the game environmenthonestly this is pretty low priority in my opinion but there is a clear inconsistency here that the op is pointing out
no dumbing the game down is not inherently a bad thing in this case eliminating unnecessary and unconventional hoops that supercap pilots have to jump through is beneficial to the gameedit supported
well to be honest it is a huge sacrifice i would like to see supercap security heightened perhaps a non sov requiring supercap docking facility for poses would be in order i have already trained a garage alt for mine which took about 5 months it is aggravating that these ships are so vulnerable but its the price you pay for the awesomesauce i suppose
the major con in this case is being stuck inside it  there isnt any out of game penalty at all you are free to fly one or fly something else all you cant do is be half baked about it and decide to fly it one day and not the next without somewhere to park it be it a pos supercap array corpmate or a garage altyou decide to fly a supercap that is part of the price you pay there is no inconsistency at all you know what you are getting yourself intothese are supposed to be expensive end game ships for use by big alliances they are not shiny toys for anyone who wants to fly one casually there is nothing to stop you if you have the isk and the skills trained but you have to accept the issues that go with themi mean you cant even move system without assistance do you think that is unfair toorisk vs reward 8000  10000 dps ships have drawbacks deal with them
i wrote it there first and it seemed redundant to post exactly the same thing again when a link would suffice no one is forcing me to fly ships either or play the game flying a supercapital is the natural endgame of the combat pilot no not all will want to go there to be certain  thats personal preference  but most combat pilots dream of the day that they can helm a titanmost will quit the game long before and of course not all toons are combat pilots yes i could do the easy thing and train an alt to make my nyx or erebus magically disappear anytime i dont want it  but that doesnt seem to be in the spirit of the game to me the point of these ships being unable to dock is that they must be kept someplace they are artifacts in space mobile stationsbut thats not how the game is played right now thats just not an option so players take advantage to make them magically disappearshrug i do not see this as a good thing  or in the spirit of the sandbox of evei could indeed do those things easily i could even go and dump real cash on a whack of pilot licence extensions to buy both the garage alt and the ship i wouldnt even need another account i could do all those things oh tomorrow if i wanted to i could afford the real money  that isnt the pointnone of that is playing the game sure its allowed but its not playing the game its metagaming and i dont happen to like or support metagamingyour mileage may vary of coursemeaning if you arent willing to metagame then you cant have one cant say as i agree with that but that is of course just my opinionyou mean dropping a couple of hundred bucks off my credit card to ccp thats all it would take they are available to anyone  all it takes is cash and some minimal understanding of the market you dont even need to spend the time just buy a toon on the marketinstead i spent years playing the game to become a cap pilot my wife spent months mining to get the ore to build my thanatos thats playing the game at least from where i sit doing it the other way isnt quite cheating but its buying victory and i do not think of that as a good thingi love the idea of other people being able to help  but that isnt an option hereand it does say that you can do everything without an alt actually ccp has it in a couple of places not exactly those words  but i believe the quote is something like you should never be required to have a second account to do anything in the game well piloting a supercarrier is something in the game  as i understand it that should apply
if you own a supercap its generally a given that you dont have to worry about money if you absolutely must restrict yourself to one vessel ive heard you can rake in 150milhour running anomolies in milfs as for titans im sure you could hire out your bridging services etc etctldr you are not being forced into an undockable behemoth of awesome if you want one of these vessels you have to accept the consequences it is possible to operate without an alt in them just dont expect to be doing much else dont expect to be able to have your cake and eat itps i would much sooner leave a supercap unattended at a 1000au safespot while i went and ran some level 4s or something than log out in it for more than 48 hours at a friendly tower
actually it is perfectly possible and simple and easy and in fact fairly cheap to have your cake and eat it tooyou just need to have an altif you dont have one  it is functionally impossible to ever do anything else as long as you own that shipapparently this doesnt seem wrong to some folksshrug it seems entirely messed up to me i could join the alt club super easy and all my issues go away but if i want to keep everything in game nopethis doesnt seem broken to you
come on every person almost that studied the hacking skill and saw a secure can instantly thought hey secure hacking i can hack itheres my proposal allow hacking v to unlock a new skill secure system hacking skill that for each level reduces secure can hacking time by 10at secure system hacking 1 you could lock onto and move within 2500m of a secure can and begin to hack it but as soon as you begin to hack it and for the duration of the hack you become a flashy red to the corp that owns the can itself for the duration  15m also the corp would be notified via eve notification of the hackthe hack will take i dont know 10m at ssh1 and 5m at ssh5 after the hack is completed the hack will allow for the can to be accessed by the hacker for 15mthe flash red during hack and the long duration should give people a chance in the offended corp to respond and defend the can if they so feel like it

just my 2 centsid kinda like to see an entire rework of the visual stuffbasically people complain now and then about warping through planets stations etcand then this talk of warpingjumping into a grid and dying before you even saw what was thereso id like to see travel more akin to star trek or babylon 5 either your ship aligns to warp and then disappears or enters a conduit then you travel through whateverness until you arrive but before then the camera drones we see the world through warp ahead faster they arrive on scene and start loading the grid when everything is loaded then we arrive either out of the conduit or just flying up like we do nowhow do we know when its loaded you ask id say we use the same gate cloak timer stuff if you warp to a location and do nothing then you will arrive in 30 seconds if you are loaded and attempt any action then you will arrive at that pointnow i realize this could easily lead to a lot more ambushes having an entire fleet suddenly spawn and open fire would be unpleasant but the usual rules for targeting time would still apply so incoming ships would not have an advantage of already locking before theyve arrived while ships in site will now be able to target a ship as soon as it arrives rather than waiting for the warp invulnerability to wear offim sure theres kinks to iron out but thats the gist of it
as opposed to half the fleet appearing to the enemy but being unable to do anything seems like very little difference to me
optimally fix the grid load problem and grid crashing but at minimum give the attacker a chance to act so yes i agree with proposal
i dont like this idea yetto explain there are times that the grid does load and pilots can see that there is a gate camp so they use a second login to boot their still cloaked ship off the grid while still cloakedthen their ship warps off while it is still logging in on the new login they do it again this resets the point where they will reshow up on the grid ussually 10000s if not 100000s of km from where they exploited thisuntil the developers fix this exploit i would say no to this as if you jump and then on your voice coms such as outside services such as mumble vent or teamspeak get the holy crap signal pilots could then use the exploit mentioned above we recommend that any time a pilot is logging out that you continually return to that same point on the origional grid and that that point not be changed for 180 seconds from inital logout or until your ship is actually back on the on a grid where they first initially logged out
30 seconds is hilariously inadequate for this issue i have been in fleets where we jump a system no one else is in the system  no enemy fleet  nothing then cook dinner eat dinner and still have time before the grid loads you may think im joking if you havent experienced it yet im notit isnt my computer it isnt my internet connection i have a good computer and a fast connection fios besides if it was client side everyone in the fleet wouldnt finally load the grid all within seconds of each other short of the handful who clicked jump firstright except you can still do this anyway the only benefit to a gate camp from this bug is if a large fleets jumps in to break up the camp the camp might only be faced with the first few ships and thus be able to escape of course the logoffski exploit doesnt work if your client isnt loading the grid because then you cannot log back in because the client will hang on loading the grid again however if you face this bug you have absolutely no intention of pulling a logoffski as you are in a large fleet purposefully jumping into a system this bug is connected to a large fleet moving not something jumping into a large fleet see the above reference to jumping into empty systems and the client hangs

supported i wouldve bought quite a few items in the past if it was not for the shipping costs
but then theyll just need to fix the fix for the fix for warping sideways in the next monthi didnt care too much about this original bug but bugfixes that dont fix bugs are a case where i have to take a stand on principle
ok this sounds fun me too i want to play the lets fix this as if we are experts  in large fleet fights the servers should be able to switch to some sort of group interaction mode the goal being to split the gridit would keep this interaction to lets say targetting or approachwhen you targetapproach x you and x are dynamically moved to a place with ressourcesthis will be the laggy part this group will isolate itself from the rest of the systemgrid it will no longer send or process the rest of the grids event in realtime it will focus on its members for processing when you are in the group you dont see the other messages 998 other ships movementshootingelse you just really see what you care about the guys shooting yourepping youtackling you it is not ideal but it would be better than looking at a frozen screen if you or x is targetted by y then y joins you in the groupof course your group will update the other groups with whats happening inside but instead of doing it every second it could do it every 10 secondsas for area effects bombs smarties they would only affect the groups in range and it should minimize the impact of the thingyou could be part of multiple groups but the more groups you are in the slower you arealso the more crowded the group is the slower it will get the fc would finnaly have to use and trust their wingsquad commander maybe a tool could be implemented to allow the fc to assign targets to a wingsquad so they know what to shootsomething like squad1 engage target1 to target10 squad 1 gets the assignement and willshould only target whats in the listit would make it more interresting and would need more preparation for the fcsand if the group is too laggy the untargetting would allow you to select other targets and kill them fasterthe goal would be to divide the fleet fights to smooth things down of course this is a different mechanism and it will not make everybody happy but we all agree that 30vs30 lag is not bad and we all agree that when we are 600 on the battle field we dont need to know the position of all of them in realtimeanyway ccp what you are doing is great we should all remember the days where 4 players multiplayer games were lagging as hell now we need to change the way we see big fleet fightsso this is my idea please commentaddflame
ive been trying to get into pvp for the last week or somy problem has been that the barrier to entry is really high i spent a week looking for some other noob i could kill and i couldnt find anyonei did fleet up with my corp a couple of times but there are three problems with that 1 you dont actually feel dangerous or powerful you just rush to some target and warp scamble them its fun but kinda limited 2 youre just doing as youre told youre not really thinking about how to win fights and 3 it can take hours for a corp to get a fleet togetheri havent tried faction warfare but ive not heard good things about it basically its a gank me toggle unless you group up in which case its functionally identical to a low sec rovethis is my suggestionlimit faction war to the first 6 months of a characters life or possibly an accounts life so it becomes heavily dominated by noobs the idea is to have an environment where nearly everyones a noob at the moment its just too hard to find pvp thats both empowering and fun if youre new either you just tag along behind an expert fc or youre free killboardage to the bitter scrapheap challenge veterans who live in low secthis solves 3 problems1 noobs can find noob on noob pvp easily ok there may be some alts in the mix but at least theyre not on 3 year old toons with all relevant skills at 52 faction war does something different from low sec pvp at the moment they are both find a mother duck to take you and the other ducklings for a walk experiences3 faction lp rewards would be exclusively the property of noobs giving new people some attractive income by making it impossible for veterans to grind these lps in marauders it will be a viable money making option for new pvp players
have you checked out red vs blue i think it solves the majority though not all of the problems you raised for a background on it it is two corps that are constantly at war with each other in highsecpeople usually use cheap fittings and small ships in the fights and most of them have really low sp additionally their hqs are two systems apart so you can find targets with relative ease perhaps you could try rvb out and then come back to see if this suggestion you proposed is really necessary
first there is a pretty large group of players in eve who would all fly out to iceland and cause violence to the devs if they limited faction warfare to only noobsthere are a few big alliances in the game who have been making recurring threadnoughts because alliances arent allowed to join faction warfare i mean were talking people who have been with the game since the beginning who have been waiting that long for faction warfare so gonna have to disagree with the idea of making faction warfare only for noobsyou want to get into pvp the way to do that is what you are already doing get together with a group and pvp togetheras to the idea of doing what you are told there really is a lot of autonomy in fleets autonomy comes with adding new and exciting modules to your fit tired of tackling get an ecm frigate or a bomber or any of the various other ships designed for other purposes if it takes hours to get a fleet together youre doing it wrongalso people solo in frigates interceptors bombers ecm frigates etc at issue may simply be you need to learn how to find targets to solojoin eve university from what i hear they take noobs and churn out pvp pilots in about a month most noob friendly alliancecorp can do the same
i would like the proposal of adding a cloaking bubble basically deployed the same way as warp bubbles available in the same sizeswould cloak any ships within range but would need to be size of bubble  10km from any objects besides ships or canssecure cans so not near a belt to cloak miners or anything like that as the ore would disallow the deployment of the cloakit would also not allow locking anyone outside the bubble while your inside or shooting etcif an enemy gets withing 2500m of the bubble it collapses and wont come back up till the enemy leaves the decloak range once the bubble collapses you can lock fire attack  or once you leave its cloak you can fight etc as normal i think this would be a useful addition for deployment during op staging etc and of course more dasterdly deads like having a bunch of small frigates hidden right off of a belt a 1020km from range waiting to spring to action on unsuspecting victimsthe cloak depending on size and t1t2 would have different sizes and also different time frames before they are no longer viable and disable themselves
so you get all the benefits without the penalties of cloakingdoesnt really sound balanced to me
make the bubble visible systemwide like a cyno and then it would be ok you see the bubble but dont know if anyone is inside or notbut that way it wouldnt be so gamebreaking but then it would be almost useless so still wouldnt get my support
eve already has enough cloaking in it and i believe its fine and balanced the way it is there is no way to balance your idea realistically as it is horribly overpowered as is almost every ship in eve can fit the most basic cloak you either fit one on your ship or you dont
for selling and transfering characters its offered to people with credit cards only which in this time and date is pretty stupid since alot of people like myself dont want credit cards or to touch anything of the sortwhich means that loads of characters that people without credit cards or no acces to one that wants to sell the characters they dont use no more are going to waist and not beeing usedetc i have a frieghter pilot and a mission runner pilot that i have no need for any more and wouldnt mind getting rid of but now they are just sitting offline for about 1 year now doing nothing and getting dusty with alot of moldy parts lol all that is needed is for ccp to add more payments such as paypal or cash cards which im sure isnt to much to ask for and isnt hard  and im sure it will profit for both ccp and the custemers selling characters
sounds fair to me cant understand why you can pay for eve using paypal but need a cc to transfer toon
very good point dallso supporting my own topic 
same problem
signedi have a cc but yes why cant other payement do the same thingi support this post
btw could you guys hit the sign box when your posting works better lol dbtw ty for support guys 
i completely agree i would definately have myself a nice couple bil more because i have chars that arent doing anything atmsigned
the reason creditcards are used for char transfer is to track down scammers easierpaypal is useless in that regard
i do not support yetlevel 4 mission income nerf is already a hotly contested topic and you are proposing a buff via faster lootsalvage acquisitioni agree there is logical reason to add a tech 2 tractor but 1 level 4 isk boost2 ccp already said miners are not the main source of high end mineral reprocessed mission loot is wtfi may support this later after these issues are addressedalso tech 3 ships and marauders already have a tractor beam bonus they can both do 40km and 1000ms beams edit yes there are salvage fit tengus out therelevel 4 mission drops average 12000 isk per m3 i started looting and salvaging again and put all the stuff into giant secure containers each container sells for 40 million at jita i could get more isk if i had the reprocessing and broker skills use someone else and a courier contract to get your cans there or you might explode at a star gate  most mission runners cant fly a transport and badgers are very gankable edit orca are  at salvage as they only have 3 slots and poor lockon times can fit sensor boosters but cant avoid high slot problem edit unless you use 2 account just to salvage 
supported
supportedsince salvage is now a proffession ans salvager ii appears it has a sense to have more ranged tractor beamsbut i think it may have really high requirements in terms of pwg and cputhat way it can be usefull for mission with high range npc but it will be faster to use more tech 1 or a fastest ship to get just a few cans or when u salvage angels wrecks
i agree with this proposal
supportedor add a skill and make the module bonuses something like10 speed bonus  level10 range bonus  levellvl5 it would have 750ms and 30km range
since tractor beams can be used only un stuff belonging to your corporation the ninja salvager mini profession does not benefits from it it would benefit lvl4 mission runners but they can earn 40 million per hour with a golem and very small risk there are a number of reason why mission grinding has to be nerfed once it has been done i will support the thread
from camiossince tractor beams can be used only un stuff belonging to your corporation the ninja salvager mini profession does not benefits from itit would benefit lvl4 mission runners but they can earn 40 million per hour with a golem and very small risk agree too but instead of nerfing mission runners i think it will be better to improve others professionsfor example if there were more dangerous npc in belts and with biggers bountyloot there will be more combat players in belt to support miners and less in missionningbut for the tech ii tractor beam i think its a good idea anyway also most new corp members with low skills use salvager to help corporate mission runners maybe with special ship fitted with special salvage modules it will become a reasonnable proffession 
when doing level 4 missions including salvaging and everything it often takes me well over an hour to do them in a dominix now i realise that a lot of people can do it faster but even then itd be nice if there where 15 minute versions of lvl 4 missions including looting and salvaging which would ofcourse be worth only a fraction of the full length equivalent this will make it much more tempting to do a little mission inbetween other things instead of investing a much larger chunk of time you can argue that you can take a break in the middle of a mission if its too long for you but its much nicer to have a sense of completion before you stop playingso to sum it upcreate a shorter version of lvl 4 missionsshorter missions should be given out by seperate agents from the longer versions to avoid standing loss issues for people trying to get a shorter missionkeep the longer versions aswelladjust amount of money made in the smaller versions according to time spent so you make the same amount of isk per hour as with the longer versions
they already have shorter versions worth less theyre called level 3s
duo of death 2 bs 2 spider dronesattack of the drones if you blitz itanyway  the flaw in your proposal is  you can only reject a mission once every 4hours if you like your standing so you will have a hard time to make sure you get such short missions everytime you want to run onesuggesting to allow you to reject missions without standing loss will just lead to people farming the good missions as we had it nicely illustrated with faction warfare missionsso while it would be nice to have those short missions it would be hard to implementhope this helps
 darius well i was thinking of adding agents that only give out short missions to fix that problem if the long missions come from different agents than the short missions do you dont have that problem
well then it should be part of your proposal an idea fully thought through and presented with all aspects will get more support than a proposal with missing parts
level 3 missions arent as tough as lvl 4s im looking for a difficulty level similar to lvl 4s just shorter besides level 3s can still take a while
correct so i edited my first post to add your suggestion to it
anything else that would make this proposal better

support need for adjustment  customization herei personally always use the wide screen option and position modules and locked targets in the black space created but i understand this is not practical for everyone  all the time
well maybe like mentioned above another tier of gang links ideas
im not sure about a second tier of links because it would cause not only issues with balance especially if they are more combat focussed bonuses but also will add to the nightmare when trying to setup a fleet for an op making sure bonuses are being given to the right peopleof course is isnt up to me so i guess we can try to discuss it as part of the info link proposal

the compulsive clicking of the directional scanner for defense and detection of intruders is bad enoughhaving to scroll down the whole results in the middle of moons planets station modules and debris is to add insult to the jurylet people choose probes on their profile its a good idea
do you even know how hard it is to find targets in wh spacedo you even know that when you finally find those targets you have to wait for hours till they come onlinedo you even know that when they come online and they actually do something you have to drop probeswich if the system is small they can see themdo you even know that sometimes if you manage to get probes on them without them bugging out 2 out of 3 times they see your probes and leave within 15 secondsthe curent system alows pvpers to get 23 seconds more on average on their scanning 23 seconds that make the difference if ccp would ever implement thisimagine the macros mining in wh systems perfectly safeso the guys that are giving a thumbs up to this are either carebears doing carebearistic sht in whs or are people who havent even tried the wh game
i could bring a lot more of my friends into eve if it had a stronger pve component more people is more better
now heres an idea that isnt open to abuse at all i will bid a ridiculous amount on one of your auctions then just before it ends i retract my bid and make a very cheap onesorry but this idea isnt going to get support even if it werent abusable because eve pilots really like our consequences even when something negative happens when we screw up if you dont want to deal with the consequences of bidding then dont bid until you are ready
i put up a contractyou bid on itmy alt outbids yousomeone else bidsmy alt outbidsrepeat until 16 min prior to contract endsmy alt withdraws bidlove it easy way to push the bid

who wouldnt want this a stick with random things hanging arround it doesnt look goodbut there is the design problem the processing power needed to dynamicly create an entire pos connections every time a new item is placed would take more than any normal computer is capable of unless you have a 4 ghz quad core and somehow managed to overclock it to 12ghz and have it still stable but that is in no definition of the word a normal computer if you could place each joining section it might be better but it would take much more time to create a pos that way and it would limit the ammount of modules that could be put on itbut anyway supportededit just for aesthetics i would like a mining laser flying out from the moon harvester and hitting the moon just because it would look good and be more realistic as long as its very thickedit2 just read the initial thread much better than what i thought here is the original thread pretty picsdoesnt look like it takes up to much cpu to create and it looks heaps better even in sketch3d forum than i imagined see exhibit i

as someone who unknowingly did this i 100 agree that all activity for an inactive account should stop i recently got back into eve after 2 years and found that my research agents had kept giving me research points they are only level 2 so it still was not that big of a deal however ccp made a change in corp standing while i was inactive and now i cant get access to one of them to get the data cores just havent bothered to grind missions to get it back upthis should definitely not be allowed

yeah the eve font is one of the worst fonts i have seen there also has been widespread arguments about having alternative fonts avaible you used to be able to hack another font in but you cant anymore because the font is now part of a bigger resource fileso sort you ui out and get rid of the horrible font
i really dont understand why but the rest of the csm seems to think the recharge bonus is somehow significant apart from a very small number of fits hardly any pvp ships rely on passive recharge however i amended the proposal to include a change so that it would not affect the passive recharge rate but then it was dubbed as being a nerf to rechargeoriented ships when compared to the current situationim not gonna argue about it anymore its just going round in circles and makes me feel like a retard i have summarized the whole thing and sent it to someone relevant to see what they think of it until then too bad sok

signedno thanks to a 100k implant 12 jumps and lowsec with my 5 implanted mission running clone remove these please thanks
yep no faction mission should be lowsec at all ever unless the reward is ridiculously high and should be in proportion to the mission fit required and the implants in the missioners head  ie total replacement costs plus potential loss of standing with the corporationif ccp dont want to do that then dont make the feature
supporting this once againi realy wish csm members would have the kindness to pop in these threads somewhat more often and not just voice their opinion but actually anoounce their intention to take this further
lag isnt contained to a single system even on reinforced nodesmaking fleets move between systems will only make matters worse
it depends on where in the cluster lag is generated if it is db related lag you cannot fight it with my proposal my proposal can win against node lag the lag generated by the fact that computing power and bandwidth in a blade are finite this is the cause of lag in very crowded systemsmy proposal does not mean to force people to move between solar system i want moving fleet to become unpractical risky and stupid attacker and defender must decide the location of his forces before the fight then just slight corrections will be practicalhow will this happenby enlarging the battlefield andor by reducing the warp speed of battleships in contested systems if the battlefield is many system wide and bss are slow moving them around will be difficult and you will not be able to compensate for mistake you made in deployment time maybe you could add a mechanic that reduces warp speed of ships to 20 of their normal vaule in all the constellation systems when structures are vulnerable and fight can happen so that bs warp speed are unchanged and deployment before fight becomes more critical if your bs fleet moves at 06 aus in contested systems when structures are vulnerable you will not like to have the necessity to move them to go 5 jumps away with my proposal youll have to move your forces to their designed location in advance and be smarter than nowit will be more like a chess match for the strategists while the pilots will experience less lagmaybe we should use a battlefield larger than 3 system differently from what i suggested before and set the whole costellation as the new conquering unit of course dimension of battlefield and mobilitynerfing measures are to be balanced based on many factors

here comes an idea where eve as a science fiction game can proof once more to be revolutionary original and socialimagine you could talk to your computer like in almost every science fiction movie laying in a course engage warp activate weapons initiating self destruct all by just saying it and it is not so complicated as it appearsthere are already programs like pilflus using the windows speech recognition library where you can assign keyboard short cuts to customized voice commands you define what shall be spoken like computer full stop and relate the short cut ctrl space in result the ship stops try it out you can do some funny stuff with that but unfortunately the keyboard commands in eve are limited a lot of important actions are only done by mouse as you can not access all functions in eve with the keyboard you can not assign voice commands for everything with external programsmy request the functionality of such programs should be implemented directly into eve the developers should easily be able to access all important functions in the game and assign them to customizable voice commands they dont have to program the speech recognition itself that is done by the windows library already they just have to do the mapping it would not only be a fantastic feature pushing the game experience to a new level it would also give handicaped people acess to eveone example computer initiate undock sequence ship leaves station computer acess navigational control opens map computer set destination jita system sets autopilot dest to jita computer engage autopilot activates autopilot as the text is customizable you can say a lot of funny stuff your fantasy is the limited there is a thread in the ideas and discussions forum too

problem overview macro mining is a problem that breaks down and undermines the player driven economy of eve empire macro mining robs valuable income from new players who choose to make mining a career and encourage rmt from isk farmerssolution overview original proposal retracted on bases of feasibilitysolution mechanics macro miners use bookmarks to continually warp to a set distance from the field then they rely on overview settings to warp to the nearest asteroid of choice proposed solutions should focus on hindering or breaking the efforts of macro miners while not hindering actual players solutions should also be simple enough for new players to understand and utilize
this may work for current macroers but not for others if the oredust was the size of a drone then when selecting show info on it would have the radius incredibly small and if you just simply make the macro look at the value you can find out weather the ore is ore dust or an actual rock so if this was implemented it would not stop macro mining but rather stop it until the macromaker realises how to get hisher macro to see how large the roid is good idea butmade an alt to post on forums so main doesnt get flamed in game for some reason 
ok so make them the size of normal roids but a different color
afaik all asteroids have the same sig radius regardless of size any program that could read information from the client like that is a bot bots are not the same thing as macrosone of the better ideas though the dust should be procedurally placed the server would only need to send a number for the client to reconstruct the belt the dust would also need to be nonsolid like a gas cloud to prevent collision issuescautiously supporting
well as a human miner i use a survey scanner to target asteroids to mine and this proposal would hopelessly clutter up and lag to hell the survey scanner and basically make it useless unless the survey scanner could filter out roid dust and then youd have the macro bots using that instead of the overviewsorry but not supported in its current form
this and professional macrobots can recognize different colors the problem are the professional macro used by isk sellers ringswe are not speaking by something cobbled together in the basement by some computer savvy guy but by programs created by people that get paid for them and that are experts in the field beside that any mechanism you want to implement should be reasonably acceptable by the people playing for fun or you would get the opposite effect reducing the number of player miners the people working for isk sellers are paid for what they do and generally every one of them manage a good number of accounts using macro to do most of the work if the new mechanic require a check every few minutes retarget a new set of roids after the macro as destroyed the current targets the program will need only a warning on the lines of i am down to the last set of roids then the person managing of the macro group will enlarge the proper window and target a new set of asteroids for the macro to tur into minerals if you make the mechanic annoying enough the guy that is paid to do that for a 8 hours shift will still do it maybe a tad slower but that is all while the player that pay to ave fun will stop doing something that is no more fun end result you reduce the player miners and not the isk farmer
 opi think your forgetting the obviousjust how many objects are you going to throw into the gridcan you say lag cityyup thought sonot supported
this not supported
wont workmacros would just use an ore scanner and lock the largest quantity rocks they would then continue to do as theyve always done the only thing it would accomplish is add more lag
ditto
personally i just dont see macro miners as a major issue if you think in terms of eve economics they just arent a huge problem in fact they may be a benefitright now macro miners only mine in high sec areas meaning that they mostly mine pyrite and tritanium because of the recent changes with 00 space and the ability for any alliance to now mine abc ores in any system in 00 there is an abundance of higher metals and a lack of pyrite and tritanium in fact ive seen mining ops in low sec that are purposely going after scordite and veldspar because there just isnt enough down in 00 space a macro miner will never make as much isk as an active miner that joins a corp in 00 space or even one that is in high sec since they will choose dense and massive over regular oresthe removal of those macro miners would drastically increase pyrite and trit prices which would cause corps to focus their efforts on mining veld and scordite even though they are the less valuable ores simply because they need the ores to manufacture things
there are two ways macro miners could be stopped very quickly1 pirates are supposed to be defending their roid belts hence the pirate spawns increase the pirate spawns in proportion to the amount being mined and the repeativeness of the mining location  ie pirates gain knowledge of player activites and begin to target specific players in specific areas new players exempt from this mechanic2 decrease the value of all high sec roid belts and make larger roid fields available via the exploration mechanism basically forcing human interaction in mining
same what a nightmare

if the 10 people whining can still play the game on low settings then where is the real problem they can still play the game exactly as before if they dont like the way it looks then unfortunately that is a personal preference and not ccps problemi am all for splitting the client again everyone with a laptop from 2002 and equivalent should realise its 2010 the current low settings should become the new slim client whilst ccp should make the current high settings the new medium maybe then ccp could finally employ a shader model from the last 5 years  as the new high setting and keep up with the award winning graphics that were part of their earlier daysthe graphics should have as much excellence as the rest of the gamethose of you with rubbish putes please flame away
bring back medium shader
no if it isnt being used i would rather ccp devote their time energy and resources to developing and maintaining other features and i trust ccps game logging and i dont understand why you act like it is so surprising that ccp tracks user settings over your anecdotal account of it being a lot of people
have you realised that what 90 of games you can buy have a low and high and completely skip the medium if your computer cant handle it in any sane job you can just work i dont know a week and buy yourself a top of the range computer it really isnt that hard to keep up i say the only people complaining about the removal of medium are the people that are to young to have a job or have one and simply dont value their computer enough to through a mere 1000 in my currency much less for anything else to get a computer that can run absolutely anything on highedit also why is everyone surprised that they look at your client in the eula there is something about monitoring how you use eve to send back information and increase reliabilityusability and i didnt even read the eula to know that its just basic stuffanyway definitely not supported
look if you never used it then what do you care this is for those that used it be it for hardware restrictions or because hishader looks like crap without aathose that did use it did so for a reason and now their entire gameplay experience has been changed
if you want csm to raise a proposal it is supposed to be posted in hereirrelevent to the discussionthe easy thing is simply leave your pilot in the supercap in the first placethe point was simply that you are not being forced to buy another account your combat pilot can remain in the supercap and no alt is required im glad you have lots of money good for you but it is irrelevent to the discussionyou can own a supercap with a single account without paying a penny to ccp no metagaming required simply you have to accept that unless you pass it to another player or leave it at a pos your pilot is going to remain in it till it is destroyed or sold is this a hard concept for you to understandccp are not forcing you to spend any money on extra accounts you howver want to fly a supercap and want the option to leave it on a whim sorry but to do that you have to pass it to somebody else or park it at a posand you can continue to play the game to become a supercap pilot  but you have to accept that your pilot will be stuck in itlinkyou are not being forced to have an alt to fly a supercap you just have to accept that you cant leave it without handing it to somebody else or parking it at a posand you can fly it without an alt if you choose to remain in itaccept the drawbacks and fly a supercap or dont fly a supercap and have the option to fly anything else in game when you likethis is the same argument ive seen in other games where people moan they cant solo everything and shouldnt be forced to team up however in this case you have the option but have to accept the drawbacks toowhat next moan you cant use it in empire
not supportedif you dont want to dedicate a pilot to flying a supercap then you dont really want to fly a supercap
parking it at a pos is not a realistic option that is the point of the proposal the idea is to make parking it at what is supposed to be a secure location not tantamount to sticking it next to a jita stargate with the words steal me sprayed on the side in kilometer high lettersas to the rest of your post its clear that were not going to agree so i shant waste any more time on the discussion you are clearly one of those everyone must absolutely have alts types and on that we are never going to agreeand yes stating that you must either have an alt or undergo the near impossible in order to play really is the same as saying you have to have an alt
no one that i know anyway dedicates a pilot to flying a supercapthey just dedicate an alt to parking itah well clearly im wasting my time here
i certainly didnt say you must have an alt and it isnt impossible to play without one you have the choice to play in a supercap and accept you have to remain in it or play in every other type of ship in game the reward for the supercap is superior dps etc the riskdrawback for a supercap is not having the ability to park it 100 safely without remaining inside itall supercap owners know thisthere are other things in game you can do that will restrict you from doing other things however if i tried to raise a proposal to allow me to be a 10 pirate most of the time but still be allowed to run missions in empire when i felt like it without getting attacked then you would laugh if i tried to raise a proposal to allow me to enter gallente space without being attacked while i remain in the caldari militia you would laughi could go on but it boils down to thissome things in game require you to make a choice and accept the outcomedrawbacksi see no compelling reason to put in a change to create less risk considering the huge buff supercarriers just got
do these so called the risk is needed members even fly super capital shipsall i see here are a bunch of self proclaimed experts claiming that the risks are acceptable yet i get the sneaking suspicion none of them fly supercaps themselveshow utterly ironici dont fly a supercap obviously but i know people who do and i can tell you right now they dont exactly have a fun time doing it personally i have no intention of flying a supercap maybe a cap if all i have to look forward too is an another damned alt to park my damned ship no thankstheres got to be a reasonable yet better way to do thatusing the argument hes prob really rich and can afford an extra account is totaly stupid and very foolish of an assumption people who fly super capitals are likely going to lose them the alliance hopefully will likely bankroll his replacements provided he does something in exchange for said supplies its a teamwork effort i doubt seriously these pilots have bling bling and fat wallets to boot for this kind of workeven then the time to take to train a pilot to fly a supercarrier let alone a titan is insane and not something people would go out of there way to do aside form cheating by buying a char already trained up legitimate in ccps eyes or notthats like saying i have a nomad and i can afford to pay for plexs in game and not worry about paying the accounts guess what nope cant even afford to replace the damn thingshocking isntso please stop with the foolish nonesense arguments use rationality and common sense for onceparking it at a pos with an anchoring module and passwording it or some such would not prevent theft in fact it would increase the meta gaming that goes on somehow i fail to see why people people who dont fly supercaps would have a problem with thispros supercapital pilot can take a break and fly smaller ships not so paranoid nowcons harder to rob the ship but no different that it would be to compromise a pos shield password and to nick the ship because of a foolish password choiceat least it wont involve pos bowling or something stupid that people tend to think is exploitative in fact this legitimatize the theft business kinda nice balance if you ask meyes lets keep eve risky but flying a super capital ship is supposed to be fun not a chore that keeps you chained to the damn deskfor once lets encourage the use of a single char or keeping to a single account all your doing is encouraging massaccount use and multiple alt crap and if theres one thing we could use less of is alts
common peole are you insane this guy is suggesting that 60 billion ships instead of magically dissapearing ill be placed at relative ris in the harms way yesi do frealking support that let peope anhor motheships within one hour and titans within two and half the supeecaps instead of magically dissapearing will be always there that is a very good suggesrion about passqordsyou can use a holing corp for the pos with a cap it does sound reasonable to be able to password protect ships in space although that means thag tealing from corp or alliene poses becomes impossible i am newtral on the whole passwod thing
i have two characters that fly them tyvmccp tried to prevent the proliferation of supercaps by making them very expensive  we all know how that turned out we expect about three titans ingame at any given time and only in major alliances quote from devblog 05 the only thing that is keeping everyone and his dog from having one is the risks and efforts that storing one brings if you have lots of isk or rl money you can pay for an alt to store it or for a pos but there will always be risks involved when swapping the thing see constantineei stick firmly to the if you dont want to dedicate a char to it you dont really want to fly one
it is only ironic that i can fly a supercapital ship almost any carrier pilot in game can fly a supercarrier right now though training for fighter bombers takes extra time but have chosen not to fly one because i dont want to dedicate a pilot to itworking as intended methinks and i know people who fly supercaps and are having a great time with their unique abilities even more so with the new fighter bombers it is irrelevant to the discussionparking the ship at a pos so your character can fly something else is your choice but it has risk in doing so if you dont trust the others in your corp if an alliance provide supercapital ships they could also provide somewhere to leave them if requiredthe cost argument was only brought up because the op complained that ccp were forcing him to pay for a second account just to fly a supercap which we have already proven isnt the casebut any carrier pilot in eve can fly a supercarrier if they wanted there are factors why people dont cant afford one dont accept the drawbacks didnt think they were useful enough but that is working as intendedbut when you bought the nomad you knew the limitations on it cant jump into empire cant jump without a cyno characteralt to assist you were able to except the limitations on one ship type but think drawbacks on a supercap shouldnt applyspeaking of nonsense what exactly is the point of allowing a supercap to anchor at a pos if it doesnt prevent theft isnt that being what the op is so upset about in the first placei could make the same arguement about running a pos i dont want it to be a chore but it is the reward for the pos chore is isk but im not forced to do it the reward for a supercap is unique abilities but you are not forced to fly oneall we are doing is encouraging people to take responsibility for their choices in game instead of whining that they cant fly a supercap on a single account and fly anything else whenever they like without riski and others do not want to see the barrier to entry for supercapitals to be so low that a solo player can decide to fly one casually they are supposed to be end game ships for alliances to use and whilst solo players can own and fly one they have to accept the drawbacks on that ship you are not forced to use an alt to park it so the initial argument falls to bits it might be inconvenient to be stuck in a ship but it was your choiceit isnt rocket science
the most disturbing thing about this thread seems to be that there is no variety of opinion amongst any of the csm membersis this how you guys see a discussion developing by shooting down a proposal because you all seemingly have a vested interest against ita posthoc argument like being stuck in a ship comes as part of the risk of flying the ship completely made up is not exactly a good rational one is it sounds more like dogmatism to me
you saw that tooi would call it something far more explicit but then id get banned  o p
because two csm members giving feedback represents the whole of the csm notice on the subject of variety that you are getting the same reaction to this proposal from supercap and non supercap pilots within the csmperhaps rather than pointing at the csm as being biased you should instead examine the proposal except there isnt onewould you rather i reserved my comments for when we are in session and can vote the proposal down without public discussionsurely by being open about the reason i dislike the proposal i am giving the op a chance to look at it from another point of view and possibly amend it of course the op decided against actually making a proposal in here even after i pointed this out preferring instead of a proposal to link to a nice story about how he has a dream to fly every gallente ship in game and that evil ccp wont let him without an altas we have said you do not need an alt to fly a supercapital thus that argument is failyou might choose to have an alt or a trusted friend look after the ship for you when you decide to fly something else but that is up to youyou might choose to leave it parked at a pos unoccupied but that is your choice and part of the risk is that somebody in your corpalliance might nick it this is no different to leaving stuff in a public corp hangerexcept that the argument is not made up it is fact and thousands of players have been willing to accept it in exchange for the powerful benefits you get from a supercapitalill spell out my objectionsupercapital proliferation is not in the best interests of the gameone of the controls on their use is the cost but these days even non sov holding alliances can afford them another control is their inability to dock which means they cannot be insured default payout only and that it requires a greater level of commitment from a players character in wishing to fly one because they cannot park it 100 safelyin exchange for those restrictions you get a superior ship imagine that a concious choice for flexibility in which ships you fly or be stuck in one uber ship instead capital ships already have limitations on use supercapitals just take that one step further
i dont care if it makes something less fun or less challenging boohoo adapt thing is this limitation makes no sense within the confines of the game universein shortgame world coherence  gameplay issuesthus supported
erm did you even think about what you postedop is the one who doesnt want to adapt this limitation has been with supercaps since they were introducedanyway this isnt going anywhere people are trying to point the finger at the csm for being biased trying to point the finger at ccp for forcing them to have an alt which weve shown isnt the casesome decisions in game mean you cant do other things ive shown that is the case here is another example if i choose to join factional warfare on the gallente side i shouldnt complain that caldari faction police now shoot at me if i decide i actually want to go to jitaif the op actually posts a proposal instead of a cool story then either get one of the csm to raise it or use the following procedure from page 17 of the csm devblogi apologise for attempting to discuss issues with the playerbase i guess people would rather discussions were in private
10 minutes sounds good since it allows the alert miner more than enough time to switch to a hauler and empty out the can if hes not able to fight back at all and at the same time it wouldnt be quick enough to force him to be glued to his screen at all times
definitely supported but i have a few additionsmake it so that it is a module that they use preferably in the high slot so that they may have to sacrifice one of their weapons to hack cans make the module like a salvager so that it has a cycle time but has a random chance of succeeding and make the cycle time 5min and the chance of succeeding be 25 so at lev 5 ssh discussed next point you would have a 50 chance of succeeding every cyclemake the skills hacking and ssh change this cycle time chance of success for hacking you have a 5 better chance of success per cycle and for ssh you have a 5 less cycle time per levelmake a module that miners can use that disrupts the signal used by the hackers this would have a very low chance of succeeding otherwise hacking secure containers would be pointless and a cycle time of 1 min unlike a warp disruptor once it works it doesnt stop the hacker it more freezes the hackers progress until the antihacking module cycles another time and then it has another very low chance of freezing the hacker again i can imagine how hard this would be to code so if ccp wants they could just not implement thishope you can understand the ideas i think i didnt really explain them clearlyedit blah forgot something from the miners side now this has a 4th pointthats all i can bring to this idea
supported in general ill leave balance suggestions to the pros
yes
not supported it could be used just as another form of canflipping and would destroy the gscs usefulness as the containers owner may be unable to or incapable of preventing the theft either due to the inability to field a force against the can hacker nothing stopping a cruiser or bc from doing it and jetcanning the stuff for an industrial or not being online or in the areamining already has plenty of ways to force loss of safety and risk it doesnt really need more
when the skill is at lvl 5 it would allow you to hack and take over ownership of off line poses so you could starve pos off fuel and hack it
i get the feeling that is just another one of those posts designed to run solo or small group miners out of the business and enrich the big 00 groups and larger mining consortiums
i honestly fail to understand how hacking gscs is gonna drive miners bancrupt most of em use jetcans anyway you have to hack the container again for every portion of ore although it begs the question how about these containers anhored in lowsec it should also count as aggression so that if container is anchored next to a pos anyone hacking it will be shot by the pos
surely you have to fight anyway in 00 and lowsec and you have the option for anchoring the can in a safespot if you use it just for storage it would mean that you couldnt just leave them laying around all over the placein highsec you are still protected by concord the hacker maybe flashy to you but he cant freely initiate aggresion or access the can until the hacking is done during that time you can just fly to the can and empty the contents he can try to suicide you or just leave with nothing he cant do a canflip since he cant unanchor the can he can just clean up unattended secure cans that he has managed to findit would change the nature of secure cans though it would still give you limited protection even when you anchor it where others can find it but you couldnt just leave them laying around or you will risk losing the content im not a secure can user so im not going to support or bash this implementation but i like the idea of deepening some of the current skills and hacking is one of the more obvious skill to develop
nope not suppoertedfor many reasons1 a secure can is a secure can  notice the wording secure2 decrypting secure information takes days to years with todays technology based on 128 bit encoding quite frankly 10 minutes is stupidly insulting3 its basically making a feature of the game redundant its a feature to be used not abused if you are that way inclined just remove the feature4 the obvious defence would be to deploy hundreds of cans making the task of hacking worthless creating more lag5 why the continued knock on miners  im not a miner but quite frankly ive had enough of this crap its time the we saw some reverse of the action in the capsuleer comunity given the long suffering of miners all mining activities should receive a boost and mining ships should gain some teeth6 there is no valid reason why things shouldnt be left as they are this feature would only be used by a very small number of eve players and the net result in secure cans no longer being used results in a complete waste of time in development
can you give some examples please
 notify dual light pulse laser ii deactivates as patchkord begins to explodeso nothing changed
alright so we can label it still not fixed
confirming killmails to be anything but fixedi even saw large fleet fight node crash  all killmails from the last 10 minutes of the fight are gone
yup still not fixed
i support the topichowever i dont think the thought processes are fully engaged capsuleer ships should improve in relation to the demands within the economy in other words given the out and out attacks on mining vessels the manufactureers should respond in kind and give the vessels both sustainability and teeththe civ ship angle is stupid these are capsuleer vessels not civilian ships in the case of hulks they are meant to with withsantd the rigours of 00 space never mind highsec gankssupported but go further suggest they get a tank and drone bonuses similar to gallante
based on the recent changes to how large mass ships now enter warp we are left with inaccurate representations of ship warp alignment especially on ship undock or being bumpedone possible idea is to use a transparent arrow as the direction needed for warp and then to use another transparent arrow to represent where the ships inertia direction it is currently moving towards is pulling it once these two align with each other the ship is aligned for warp and all that is needed is 75 of max speed which is already represented by the 2nd notch on the hud speed displaymost likely a timed rotation of ship would be needed to decently show alignment of ship
i see this working best as some version of the old preexodus spinning globe display from the bottomright of the screen that became the overlay the ship model can do what it likes to get as close as possible to some kind of realism but itd be very useful to have an accurate visual display of the current velocity vector and destination vectoras it is atm whatever tweaks are made to the way the model displays its still a compromise between accurately depicting what your ship is actually doing in the game and a fake realism imposed on top for the sake of visuals
supportedop dont forget to support your own thread
ugh one of those days ty for reminding mebtw i also think that these alignment arrows should appear when warp is requested probably not something everyone wants to see and certainly should become a removable option for those with limited cpugpu power
supportedone addition i would like to make if you highlight something in the overview an arrow would pop up so that its not just for warping i would use this in low sec to stop getting ganked by gate camps trying to get to my baseedit forgot the support button
ive noticed that there are some rather redundant messages for bonus skills in some ships take the cerberus for examplecaldari cruiser skill bonus 5 bonus to kinetic missile damage and 10 bonus to missile velocity per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus 10 bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile flight time and 5 bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per levelthis ship requires caldari cruiser v before you can even fly it so why list this information in the description this way i can understand listing the heavy assault ship bonus because you only need level 1 in that skill to fly the ship and the rest is optionalso i propose that this ship description and all others using the same method change to reflect more accurate information in examplethis ship has a standard bonus of 25 to kinetic missile damage and 50 bonus to missile velocity per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus 10 bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile flight time and 5 bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per levela period on the ends of those sentences wouldnt exactly hurt either thanks for your timeeurlanthe society of innovation
signedit make sense and it will be clearest in most minds
yes i see that as a very important issue aswell
im not supporting this for the simple reason that ccp has and could changed skill prerequesites for things and doing so in the future would now reuiqre them to make multiple edits forget to make one and you can bet the next whinge post on the forums will be zomg why am i not getting my full bonus as listed in the ship descriptionelventyonethe current descriptions make perfect sense  as long as you think about what theyre saying
should make things a bit simpler good ideaplease dont put the entirety of the subject in all caps
supporting my own idea reworking the store so shipping costs are sane would bring in a lot of cash as well as provide free advertising eve loot  free advertising more ppl subscribe
two things are related in belt mining 1  macro miners can mine safely and they do2  mining interest miners and thats all other players consider mining as a really boring activitymy proposal upgrade the npcs in belt and give them more abilities like ecmeccm warp scramblethat way mining will require more fighters to defend the operation oriented combat players will prefer helpminers if there were more dangerous opponent and bounty and loot related but minerals should be more profitablethan just killing ratsit will probably take some times before more combat players really want to help miners but if they dont the prices ofminerals will go up so to help keeping price low theyll have to helpcorporate mining will become more attractive and solo mining will become more difficult  encourage players to join corps and play togetherwhat do you think of thishave you any other idea that can help against macro miners and encourage other players to play with miners 
and how lone players in paperthin mining barges would defend themselfyou cant require everybody to pay for multiple accounts
i disagree lone players can be part of corporation eve is a mmo not a standalone
if theres one thing eve doesnt need its a mining nerf
joining a corp is an option not a requirementmmo means you play in a game where lots of people are present not that you are required to be chummy chummy with them
currently theres no rats in 0810 systems at all am i right new players can mine in those systems with their paperthin ships 0507 systems should see some upgrade to rats yes currently theres no point going to a belt with combat ship as the rat bounties and loot is minimal not too big upgrade though as it would make ratting in low sec pointless
yesand it will also encourage miners  even solo to mine in the same belt than othersyou can profit even in solo if there are other players who mineprotect minersits just a way to improve the mining system in a more interactive way also lot of low lvl mission runner or low lvl miners could help in protecting mining op and it will be a good way to learn how to fight stongest ia npc further thoose players were able to move in wh or in low sec belts with less fearby the way 00 belt could be really dangerous and it will be more difficult to farm belts just to make cash and the most valuable ore will be more profitable too due to the difficulty to mine
then dont whine that you cant do this and that
so what about this proposalif someone have a good solution against macro miners and to encourage players to play more with miners and in more different way than just haulim open to all suggestions but i really think improving danger in belts could help miners and industrial corporations cause if there are less macro miners minerals will be worth the cost and if combat players can be part of mining operation theyll can get some paiement for this so they dont loose isk due to increasing price at the begining it will automatically up prices of minerals cause they could gain money by helping miners
no combat pilots who are interested in fighting tougher npcs have many options they can go to low and null sec systems they can run complexes they can run missions they can go down wormholes and tackle sleepersthere are already plenty of reasons for miners to fleet up  mining foreman mining director needing a hauler the orca its high sec for a reason safe from other players no safe from npcs after a certain level of training yes as a monthold industrial character i still had trouble with anything worse than 7 rats and retrievers cant mine solo in 5 without insane drone and shield tank skillseveryone always wants to solve the macrominer issue by making the game worse for real players who like mining how about this idea if youre 100 certain that a given miner is a macro then report it to ccp and theyll deal with it otherwise let us industrials mine ore make stuff and haul it to sell in your favorite mission hub so you can supply your combat ships as you go after the tougher npc listed above
nomake them smarter insteadif a mining op is on and a wave of rats is killed the next one should reflect what the npc faction has learned since either have them keep an eye on the op by sending small scout gangs once in a while and wait for the op to go soft or they could  in low sec at least  sweep the belt every once in a while with overwhelming numbers in 00 rats should really adapt if this is their sov space they ought to usually return with fleets that are determined precisely by the expected opposition
i agree roid belt rats should be increased and some kind of mechanic perhaps to even see pirate factions spawn their own bases and even begin mining themselves i mean why not  brings the game to lifei do agree miners should not be singled out as free for all targets as seems to be the case atm so some care and attention here but i do think its not unreasonable for miners to gang up moreheres something i posted on another thread as some other optionsthere are two ways macro miners could be stopped very quickly1 pirates are supposed to be defending their roid belts hence the pirate spawns increase the pirate spawns in proportion to the amount being mined and the repeativeness of the mining location  ie pirates gain knowledge of player activites and begin to target specific players in specific areas new players exempt from this mechanic2 decrease the value of all high sec roid belts and make larger roid fields available via the exploration mechanism basically forcing human interaction in mining
this is not drone damage mods
pharon what youre saying makes sense not sure how people dont understand iti can tldr this thoughtldrserver only sends notifications for others firing when you are the one being shot at so you will not see your friends being shot but it doesnt matter because you have turret effects off anyway yes the server has to notify you that x person is shooting x there doesnt need to be any analysis of code to assume this yes generating larger packets takes up more memory imagine that i highly doubt this is already implemented as its a pretty obscure thing to change server side operations based on client side visual settings

i hadnt and it sounds idealplease consider this suggestion withdrawn for now
tabs would be useless for the security issue im referring to people on probation would just wait until they werent on it anymore to steal stuffi understand a complete overhaul is needed but this seems like a simple enough idea to implement while the overhaul is done perhaps thats being naive
what happens if the sma or tower is taken offline
the major problems of owned station and pos is the offline conditionmaybe its time to think about this and find another systemi dont know how exactly but its the eternal problem whats the meaning of a pos or station if its offline i agree the building needs some fuelressources but the offline status can perhaps be changed by a low capacity status or something
infowar warfare links have indifferent performance at best and are only used in very niche situations in which case it would still be better to bring a different ship to the fight rather than an eosas gallente are mainly armour tankers i propose moving the armour warfare links from amarr to gallente and giving amarr a new set of capacitor based warfare links possibly one for cap amount one for cap recharge and another for cap useplease comment
please read the meeting minutes from jan 3rd where we discussed information warfare links and passed a proposal to improve themthere was even another proposal about info links raised here a couple of days ago we dont need another thread
whilst its encouraging to see the csm bringing this point up unfortunately the proposal detailed on jan 3rd isnt very good it still leaves us with an ecm ganglink which is still rather niche and not particularly effective and rather ungallente and some sort of probe bonus ganglink which is even more circumstantial and will probably be used less than the eos is used nowganglinks should offer broad bonuses that affect all of the fleet not just affect the ecm ships and tacklers with the proposed change people will still not bother bringing the eos because its just not useful enoughwithout providing any bonuses to offensive modules the proposal above would allow ganglinks to provide bonuses to shield armour speed and capacitor the four foundations of a ship and fleets tanking ability
well i like this idea but i would treat it like a regular cloak on a shipgive the negative bonuses that you would get from the regular cloakingalso i would suggest forcing people to at least have covert ops at 4 make tech i tech ii  covert ops modelsthere are a lot of other small details that could be applied to this because this could give people a major boost but this could also be majorly just think of itstealth bomber perma cloak would be so over powered
so basically you can make a safe spot anchor said cloaky bubble go rat in 00 without the penalties of having to fit a cloak then when someone comes in local you warp to your cloak bubble in total safetythis is a troll right
dude youre delusional besides being completely off topic and having posted nothing worth of readingso whos the troll againso putting the thread on tracks to avoid the pack of flinging monkeys1 scanning is unchanged whoever scans finds the first room of course if they gate into an unlocked room theyd be able to warp in there if they bookmark warp out and warp back in to bookmark2 fleet dynamics remain unchanged whoever gates into mission space for the first time will have to run through the gates3 there will be no mission time increase of any kind and in no situation its in fact all the contrary everybody would be able to benefit from mission bookmarks if theyd so desire of course if you dont have a reason to bookmark and warp out this addition doesnt benefit you4 these assumptions are plain wrong its simply idiotic to even think that you or anybody else canalwaysaccept a missionrun itfinish itwithout interruptionoh well you as in anybody might be one of those basement gremlins that doesnt have a social life but otherwise people for example have friends relatives bathroom needs and similar and at some point you will leave a mission if you mainly pve of course and will surely be grateful that you dont have to pass every single gate back in when you can bookmark your cleared roomsits all of the contrary in fact unexperienced mission runners will know that its ok to warp out quickly since they will have the option to return to mission when they have refitted or better prepared for example losing mob aggro much quicker than beforeindeed there are no contrary points all of them exist already and for every disadvantage theres an outweighting benefit5 mwds in alternative to bookmarks if bookmarks arent allowed at least allow people to travel to the next gate using an mwd afterburners are aok but a battlecruiser still takes ages to cover 30 kilometers6 rooms are still locked by gates the only advantage is that if you clear the room you can bookmark and warp in laterregarding pvp carebears would have a better card to play since itd take a just a pretty quick refit you could run missions with scramblers core stabilizers etc in your cargo to get back in mission space to face your grieferspvp gets a boost and carebears have a better chance to defend their missions
what about a cash card can you not use that to track scammers in same way
create a new interface for roles put in features that are graphic intuitive and descriptive1 have a pop up that tells exactly that role does and does not allow2 have preset role configurations for corps with standardized security arrangements and roles for mining corps wormhole corps trading corps pvp corps and so on as well as a general preset this could be set by the ceo quickly and easily at corp creation and then modified later as needed3 be able to mark some hangars as secure and have a pop up if someone is being given improper access4 add role changes to the journal viewable by ceo and directors with blinking and highlighting similar to the wallet5 add journal entries for inventory control with the ability to log two or more hangars access through the corp api this will allow the creation of a web app that can alert people if a hangar is accessed or create parameters for an alert6 create an alliance drop rights system for the alliance executor corp so they can deliver stuff directly could be a special contract type similar to a haul contract that automatically unpacks in the right hangar you could also do an automatic deliver feature that puts things in the right hangar when received from an alliance membereditthe goal is to allow for secure logistics and easy delivery of supplies this will allow for an easier division of labor in an alliance so that corps can specialize better
we have already discussed something about roles and permissions but if you think it doesnt cover this issue then please raise it in the assembly forum

i like this idea could make for some very interesting things in game

ok i havent played for 6 weeks because ive been working overtime and 7 days a week making stuff for the real military and youre telling me that ccp is going to try to send an industrial character  i bought my first myrm today after playing for a year  multijumps into a lowsec war zone where unless i bring my entire alliance with me im going to lose ships and good implants for no more reward than a cheap implantwhat part of the many threads stating clearly that industrial characters will go to lowsec when the profits available there  after subtracting the losses and the cost of paying people to watch us mine  are reliably greater than the profits in highsec are these people failing to understandccp cannot force people who dont think that getting blown up and losing money is fun into lowsec even if they eliminated highsec completely we wouldnt do it wed just quit playing throwing industrialists in to sink or swim isnt going to result in anything but a firmer resolution to never leave highsec for any reward short of a completelyfitted faction hulk and a rigged itty 5 loaded to the gills with zydrinepeople who think that pvp combat is fun are already doing pvp combat let those who enjoy that play style enjoy it let those who enjoy selling them ships and ammo and doing our pvp in the market enjoy that it doesnt make any more sense to force me to run pvp missions than it would make to force dedicated pvp players to run mining missions
supported cant see any real drawbacks
well  i agree this is a fantastic idea but that csm link says nothing about a sort function for meta level it just says they will implement a meta id in the item info or am i wrong plus dominion still doesnt have this implemented although the former idea wasis bumppwnage
the idea is already going to be implemented in either the next patch or the next expansion it has been reviewed by the csm and i quote the pdf of a csm meeting ccp agrees it is trivial and that it will get doneif you want the link to see yourself
would be really good feature and hope that this gets implemented kinda losing my hopes on ccp ever doing anything right
if ccp adds a column for meta lvls to the listdetail view then it accomplishes pretty much want you want you can go to list view and sort by columns items can be moved in this view just like they can in icon viewits not exactly the same as what you want but in the end it accomplishes the same thingedit to say the only difference i can see is that in icon view you can click blank area and sort by whatever and in the detaillist view you have to click the top header to sort by that column
yes
with so many systems this fix might be the biggest update ccp would ever need to do but with dust coming out sometime soon i hope having the planet say its 5k and having the dust players walking around in shorts would really be a big oversitei would also like to see planets orbit the suns another cool fix would that the planets cant be jumpedflown though
supported but i think it should be more yellowishorange than red
a change is needed i suggest1 for concord kills reduce payout as player sp increases new players make silly mistakes and get full insurance professional gankers need to choose their targets 2 have prices adjusted because i cannot make money with suiciding in verge vendor with dominix or myrmidon and barely a profit with an unfitted catalyst so not convinced a change is needed here
duhseems like an idea long past dueperhaps separate messages like this from the client to a secondary window option that we with more than one monitor can use to free up client space
supported for the sake of transparent pngs
as it stands when the based on standings setting is used for the fleet finder corporation and alliance members cannot join the fleet unless the fc sets every corp in the alliance blue shouldnt it allow them by default if not why was it designed this way
oh im sure he would if he didnt get kicked in the gonads by this idiotic five minute forum timeras for his idea very much agreed
as far as i get it voice buddy is not compatible with eve you can only assign the short cuts eve provides but in eve there is no key for going to warp or setting a destination or docking and so on so you cant access these actions with voice buddy the developers would have to add those short cuts keyboard commands to make it work with external programs if they dont want everything to be accessable with keys for blocking makroscammers they have to implement the functions of the external program so you assign the voice command directly in eve and no new short cuts show up to the end user if you can show me a program what can set a destination in eve i would be happy i have found none so far
hi i think it is time for the salvage owner ship to be sorted outi am sick of being told that it is game mechanicsall i ask is that there is an element of risk for the salvage thievesso please alow me to treat salvage thieves as i would ore thives or can flippersallow me to shoot them with out fear of being destroyed by concordto me it is an exploit useing concord as protection for thieveryif salvage is not mine as i have been told on many occations why then is it named and flagged with my corp and alliance name on itif you want salvage do as i do and run missions for itso please clear up this unfair systemps i hope that my post meets with your exacting standards for posting as i am not the best typist in the world and would hate to think i offend your you with my lack of skill with a key board
hear hear it would be nice to shoot the thieving lazy gits
i agree with this proposal ownership of salvage should be available now that we can freely abandon the wrecks that shouldnt be a problem
yes its time salvage thieves get flagged like can flippers lets put some risk in this reward
thats a coincidence were sick of telling you that it is game mechanicsthe solution seems obvious
you know in a way youre right people shouldnt be getting rewards like that for no risk so lets make combat mission deadspaces in to little losec pockets then you can kill those naughty salvagers whenever you like  even before they steal any of your precious salvage that way everyone who gets rewards also gets riskssound good
per ccp mitnal per gm faolchu  per senior gm ytterbium  per ccp prism x  per ccp incognito  these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleetcom
and npc corps were designed to be only start up places not corps to hide ninja salvaging  hauling  rr  probing etc etc alts that cant be war decced and can act with impunity if you want to talk mechanics how about addressing that one give the carebear the option of war deccing said individuals and actually gasp doing some pvp
yes this is the replies i think need changing i think that you should be allowed to defend your work salvageregardless of the current stand on the salvage theft it needs to be discussednot dismissed out of handthis is a forum for me to air my grievencies not be told i am wrongmy oppinion is as valid as every onesso let those who think this needs changing have there say
good way of luring players into shooting the ninja so he can come back with his bs and kill the mission runnersupported 
no there are several problems with the ops idea primarily being that salvaging is not theft secondly the wrecks are not owned and therefor cannot be stolen thirdly that nice long set of quotes from ccp the other guy posted is reason enough for this not to be an issuethis is something that is wrong with your post specifically you make an appallingly commonplace logical fallacy here the fact that you are allowed to press the buttons on your keyboard and then press the post button with your mouse does not make your opinion as valid as for example that of malcanis or infact of anyone else for that matter you also make the fallacious assertion that your right to whine on a open forum concerned with balancing game issues in any way supercedes or is more holy than the right of other forum users to call you out for making idiotic points that have been repeated ad nauseum and refuted ad nauseum edit oh and also you are wrong this is not a forum for you to air your grievances this is a forum for you to try and contribute in someway to ongoing issues regarding balance in eve onlineif you want to air grievances go to general discussion cp or caod your tears will be drank up as if they were ambrosia itself
ok sorry for trying air what i think is a flawed game mecanicbut while this issue has been discussed again and a gain it still is wrong that you can profit from others work with no risk to your selfif the salvage thief shot the rat in your mission then yes the salvage belongs to themjust as when a miner shoots an astaroid the ore belongs to the minerso why does the salvage from my mission have to be differant from ore shot from a roid
the wrecks belongs to you the salvage is the result of their activation of the salvager moduleof course if you put your salvage into a can and they steal it then you can shoot them but why would you jettison your salvage
supporting every single prosalvage flipping thread since 2009
for this reason supportingdeath to mission runners
fixed it for you not everyone running missions does not know from which end to hold a gun
even if you know how to shoot back your pve fit ship would normally melt against pvp fit ships or how long does your tank last with a neut or 2 on you
as a ninja salvager i support this topicsometimes the wrecks are all empty and i cant flag myself on anything 
but it is intended mechanics and there is no problembecause there is so much risk for the mission runner by comparison right yes because that worked out particularly well for minersyou ought to reread the definition of exploitit isnt its not even salvage until its in the salvagers cargo hold pls show me a picture of an npc loot can that has salvage in itwhy should all players do as you say theres nothing unfair about it even ccp have said salvage was not introduced to give you mission runners more income it was to facilitate rig building and to create a mini profession of salvaging perhaps you should be asking for salvage to be removed entirely that would be fair it is in fact you mission runners who gain unfair extra income from salvage by virtue of the fact that its introduction was not meant for your benefit but it was unavoidable that you would benefit as a biproductthat said i support this issue as i want to laugh at you all getting owned in ur pve ships when you get what you ask for
you aired your grievances and we told you that you are wrong bingo everyone winsno it isnt your opinion may be as valid as say mine but it certainly isnt as valid as any of those gms that larg quoted above when it comes to opinions some very much matter more than others
the salvage is not yours until its in your cargo hold
insa rexionyes because that worked out particularly well for miners errr miners didnt have big effing guns last time i checked douche
on the other hand ratting and missioning ravens maelstroms etc are notorious for being universally superior to their pvp equivalents in every possible way and totally dont have to worry about their imba active tanks getting pwned by eneutagedouche
erm talking about miners douche
absolutely not how about we get rid of salvage if youre going to whine about it and not read up on the reasoning behind the decisions that ccp madefact is  salvage was added as a bonus to the loot system not an entitlement you already have loot that flags people for theft be happy with that
well done on getting the point bro let me spell it out for you the guy is saying that missioners would have about as much success dealing with ninja salvagers as miners have with griefers incase you arent aware that means next to no success at all so yeahdouche
in the real world salvage rights encompass the whole ship and cargo ie first person to get a rope on an abandoned ship takes all in reality salvage companies will sell the wreck back to the original owner for a sensible price thus you could make a strong case that all wrecks be treated in the same way including all the loot of course that would be rather harsh on mission runners in a game so we have the current system where a wreck is flagged as owned by youyour corp along with anything inside it but this contains only loot not salvage ccp have stated that salvage doesnt exist until a successful cycle from a salvager at which time some salvage appears in that ships cargohold and the wreck owned by the mission runner turns into a can thus nothing is being stolen as such all that is happening is that one person is depriving another of the opportunity to also try their luck with a salvager this is just another form of player vs player for example you killing mission rats has deprived that other player of the chance to kill them and get bounties it would be funny if mission runners could fire on salvagers without getting concorded because all that would happen is ninja salvagers would use battleships tanked against the damage you are using on the rats and they would be setup to fire a type of damage you are not tanked against in return ie it wouldnt stop the salvaging but it might cause more mission runners to lose their pve shipsthere are frequently poorly thought out proposals that dont take the wider implications into account and this is another one and the issue has already been raised and rejected many times
ok proposal retracted on bases of feasibility instead of focusing on one idea id like to turn this thread into a discussion area for solution suggestions so far some smart ideas have been put forward and i would like to keep this discussion going
definitely whilst eve is graphically very good looking in the ways of detailed models textures lighting and shaders but lacks gravely in the detail department whilst most particle effects look good theyre too repetitive and stale there is little in the way of animation and in general is quite immersionbreakingas an addition i think impacts on your ship whilst your shields still are up shouldnt hit the hull itself but rather be stopped a small distance from it about the same distance as the shield booster effect with a special shieldimpact effectsupported
i support making the combat better looking i find it is kind of bland and boring to watch right now
yes plz
this idea has been going around for the better part of 2009 and i thought 2010 would be a good time to bring it up until it goes through please support this thread until it makes it ingame read below for quick update of status and requested game mechanic all previous threads were locked due to inactivity and the functionality discussed and implemented ingame for dominion is not what was requested to the assemblywell  i agree this is a fantastic idea but that csm link says nothing about a sort function for meta level it just says they will implement a meta id in the item info or am i wrong plus dominion still doesnt have this implemented although the former idea wasis bumppwnage
are there any columns in any tabular data display in eve that you cannot sort by  it seems to me that adding the column will make it inherently sortableanyway thumbsup from me since this really needs to be added as soon as possible
on a few occasions i have been ganked on low sec gates while coming out of warp by smartbombs in addition to losing smaller ships to this the stargate wont allow you to jump in your pod because of the session change from losing your ship and thus getting podded as welli dont believe that one should be able to get destroyed without even being able to fight back in the first placeso i propose that a ship should not be able to take damage while coming out of warp so that it will allow a person to defend themselves somewhateven when a person initiates a warp and their ship starts to go into the warp bubble mode all damage is then negated which should be the same when coming out of warpi dont mind ganking its part of the game but getting blown up and podded before you even finish loading the grid should be fixed thanks
as much excellence as the sound engine yeah i thought soas a presentation eve is garbage thanks to that now theyre taking away our graphics againmy computer is fine runs on high just fine as well but i hate to disappoint so youre a moronto whom it may concern how about discussing removal of features instead of just yanking them without warning and for no good reason thanks a lot
the problem is dx9and the different render paths it supportsdirectx 90adirectx 90bdirectx 90chaving to maintain 3 render paths is not optimalthen you cut away the least used paththat is a temp fixuntill ccp decides to go dx11it has fallback path to dx101 dx10 and dx9but if you pc only can run medium settings the problem is your pcnot the engineso please ccp ignore the whiners of we want lessand embrace the dx11 render path
hey man if you wanna pay for my new comp go ahead ill have one that costs 1000 please otherwise medium shaders were perfect for me the userhmm people too young top have a job so they should be ignored then i mean they still pay for this game also thats funny the last time i bough a game that only offered high and low settings must have been what 3 years ago strange and in case brutoid wont buy me that new comp will you thanks
my income is indeed high enough to buy an uptodate computer that can virtually run anything software wise on the market today its just that i have a wife and three kids to take care of i dont think they would accept me saying to them the next 10 days we will not eat pay the rent use the phone run the car etcetera etcetera because i need a new computer to play a game i would not even want toi bought my first computer from the money i made on my first day job in 1982 when where you bornon topic please put the ability to choose medium settings back in to the game pretty please
no you nob the sound engine is rubbish and has no medium setting to remove try picking an excellent part of the game now lets imagine everything else in the game including the graphics being made just as excellenti just switched my client to low setting and im not sure whats wrong with yours but i could still see graphics maybe you should redownload yours and check again if you still cant see any graphics then i suggest petitioning ccpso you just prefere running your client on medium purely for aesthetics or what well id prefere to run my client at a setting higher than high settings for exactly that reason but alas i cant so remind me again why people who can play the game on low but prefered medium shoud be listened to againwhy is this such a standard response when people talk about upgrading if youre unable to keep up with the times financially then what can i say everybodies circumstances are different ffs stop playing eve so much and think of a way to save 20 bucks a week speak to the wife boss whoever stop drinkinggoing out cut down on somethinganything its really not that much in 5 weeks check your savings and rethink the situationbarring all that then id suggest just playing on low and deal with itin any case weve established that your pc can run eve on low so therefore you can still play the game and dont need me to buy one for you if ccp had removed low and you couldnt play it would be different but id still tell you to upgrade if you wanna play if you couldnt then maybe this isnt the hobby for youi hope ccp put the work they were doing on medium into developing a dx11 codepath and a future graphics upgrade sorry if that bothers a few of you but youll just have to change your settings down for the time being id also suggest a few of you should start saving edit can i just add that those aggrieved by the fact the change was swept in unannounced are perfectly in their rights to be so now that is something i dont agree with the change itself is one thing but the introduction or removal in this case without any correspondance was unnecessary
maybe just maybe if many people with quite a bit of experience on the subject agree that it is a bad idea it is a bad idea
so when all the people who actually know something about a subject agree on something the most obvious reason is that theyre conspiring together rightseriously sok has two mothership characters being able to dock them would be a great boost for him and yet he opposes something that would be to his personal advantage the reason for that is because he knows full well what the consequences would be  as does just about anyone who stops and thinks for a moment providing they know anything about capital warfare
in my opinion the csm is not taken serious by ccpwhile some issues which have been raised through the csm have been resolved and of course ccp cant fix everything within a week i still think too much issues are not being looked atespecially the issues sent after the meeting in iceland are not taken very serious often only getting a line or two as reply such as its being added to the backlog and were aware of this issue after which we never hear from it again for another yearcsm2 has proposed a qa session where the csm could submit questions on behalf of the players ccp hasnt been answering these either minutes take forever to approve and be published communication is one way and i feel ccp isnt keeping up their end of the bargain and do not make use of all the work the csm does for themprofilation and interest in the csm is at a low since the last elections and ccp still hasnt come up with any plan to improve on the csm system by the time they finally have something working a lot of good people arent egible to run again which is a shame the current csm needs to discuss this with ccp and look for solutions both for their own sake and that of the players
how do you expect ccp to treat you seriously when the csm constantly reminds us of what a joke it is
i came about this idea because everyone seems to be canfishing for fights in high sec by the stations so i thought people want pvp 11 and not always the blob fights in 00 lets find a way to improve this part of evelet me introduce the arena home of the gladiatorsdock at your station an open the arena contract window in the arena you accept a contract on a fight and warp to the designated space just as you would in a mission only you and your apponent is allowed in with fighting ships others can join in shuttles if they want normal concord rules apply to themthe contract you found for the arena fight can contain any number of rules you agree to and you might also place a sum of isk on the outcome as a bet the rules could for example be only cruiser class ships 2 million isk wager on outcome 11 fight  or 22 55 the sky is the limitin basic language my idea is to make station fighting a game feature by makeing a clever match making system if used to set up tournaments the winner could be awared a medal ie winner of 2010 1000 player tournamentwhat do u all think
click
hah i see im not the only one with this idea
they could even couple the arena to missions ie report back when you have won x number of cruiser class fights
ccp tried to add this feature but the client rejected the code making instances and removing the risk in eve is not cool
sounds interesting and fun go set it up and see how it works i bet a lot of people would be interested in thatps you posted your event idea in the wrong forum
why not just a button invite to duel like invite to jion fleet could also invite to duel fleet sorry if my spelling is off
thataway
just no
i love this idea and if ccp could pull it off i think it would be a huge boom to the game everyone wins you get experience whether you win or lose you get prestige if you are good and a reputation even better the economy wins and players can bet and wager ships isk etc which is just plain funa big thumbs up ps to people that complain that this would somehow degrade the realism of eve or acuse supporters of being ultra care bear i disagree completely this will encourage and grow the amount of people who understand and partake in pvp it was done in rome why not space third and final we allow people to trade toons for isk which would never happen in real life why not this just my 02 isk
please let wow keep their stupid arena for themselves
make secure cans larger so that they can be used effectively and in return i would not mind this coming into effect but the current secure cans are only used because they cannot flipped otherwise they are practically useless
even though i make a lot of money suiciding deadspace fit exhumers

not supported this would allow the practice of ghost trading create orders using alt let alt account expire keep the orders competive using main
character goes poof orders go poof goods are returned to deliveries hangarsimple
this will totaly change trading it will be more about corp effort than single jita npc corp station trader alts dont know if support it  it will totally screw single traders
wait what omg i thought the loginname was private
for various reasons accepting the char into a corp would probably be the main reason i propose that when a character has been purchased once the transaction is approved by ccp the new user receives the log in details the characters employment history will be tagged with the time and date of the transactioncest toutedit  errata
cest touthow would this prevent me selling my character to myself in order to clean the employment history and thus render the feature utterly worthlessif i was a serial scammer or spy im not id consider a 20 fee to become legitimate again a bargain
i said tag  i didnt say clear the employment history and with this tag i bet itll be harder to be accepted into a corp which knows what it is doing rather than not
ive supported this idea in the past and will continue to do so
sounds good
ive noticed that when near gases my game loses about 10fps which when avg i get 20 means alot to me i would like to disable this as well
theyre not nebulae theyre the excrement left behind by the eve space dragon
disclaimer this is not a completely original idea and people have made suggestions about changes to the way mission and rat loot is handled elsewhere but i havent seen this exact suggestion made previously if it has been already proposed and rejected or indeed approved apologies for the wasted pixelsunder the current system there is a massive quantity of npcdropped modules introduced to the game through mission running exploration and rattingthis has 2 effects well it has a whole bunch of effects but these are the two im looking at1 npc loot drops remove demand for playermanufactured modules by supplying modules out of thin air and so removes opportunities for startup t1 manufacturers to enter the alreadysaturated module market2 loot drops also provide an easy source of refineable items and so flood the t1 mineral market devaluing and disencentivising mining in favour of mission running or ratting i recently saw a figure quoted that 40 of the mineral market was provided by melted down rat loot but im not sure how accurate that is it seems illogical that nearly as many minerals are generated through a byproduct of ratting or missioning as are bought in by miningso i propose the followingreplace meta level 14 rat loot with broken components to reverse engineer into functioning meta 14 modules for example where in the current system an npc might drop an arbalest cruise missile launcher module when destroyed it would now drop a broken arbalest cruise missile launcher components item in the wreck instead the broken components item would be used in a reverse engineering job to convert a standard t1 module into the corresponding meta level 14 modulethe reverse engineering job would be a simple manufacturing job  no datacores no t1 or t2 materials no chance of failure you feed 10 t1 cruise launchers and 10 arbalest cruise launcher broken components into an open factory slot and 10 arbalest cruise launcher modules pop out at the other end in effect the broken component item would act broadly similarly to how a bpc for a faction item or ship is currently used except that multiple components could be put into the same manufacturing job to manufacture multiple modulesi know the term reverse engineering is already taken but it was the most accurate term i could come up with for this process i appreciate that reusing the term may cause confusion so if anyone can think of a better name please say and if i like it ill edit it incontinued

youre right it would mean more competition for factory slots but perhaps that would give highsec manufacturers a valid reason to join a dedicated industry corp and use their manufacturing poss so they could avoid those queues heaven forbid there should be any incentive in this game to leave state war academyout of interest since i dont spend much time in empire are the manufacturing slots in lowsec stations largely unused or are they as busy as the highsec onesok maybe it wouldnt but all i meant was that it would be something in between the twonot sure why this is a bad thing id guess the typical mission runner doesnt much care what percentage of their income comes through what source just how much income theyre getting and honestly if people are running missions to get minerals rather than mining for them doesnt that suggest an imbalance between the professions that should be addressedum no it wouldnt after this change all metaloot would be constructed with t1broken meta im not sure where you get the idea that there would be a constructed with minerals option for metaloot apologies if ive phrased something badly to create that impression of course there would still by legacy metaloot on the market which was dropped by rats before the change but the database doesnt need to distinguish between the two any more than it needs to distinguish today between t2 modules constructed through invention and those constructed with legacy t2 bpos naturally as well as plex and anomaly lootcontinues
as it happens most of our factory slots are lying empty right now from what ive seen so yes id be glad to see them getting used if it causes a problem for alliance business there are ways around it for a start the option to restrict outpost factory slots to certain types of production have the alliance members set up manufacturing poss or have the alliance set up export facilities to buy the broken loot from their members and sell it in empire i cant speak for other alliances but i know we do all of those things already 00 alliances can be creative types when they need to beim glad youre such a fan of goonswarm that youre worried about any change that adversely affects us but ive not proposed this as some selfserving plot to make our lives easier sorry if im not living up to the conspiracy theorieswhy wouldnt they why would a mission runner today spend the time looting the intact module to sell to a shopper but turn his nose up at the broken component that he could sell to a manufacturer a meta3 or 4 broken component for a popular item is still going to be worth a significant amountsurely if prices rise theres more incentive for people to loot those suddenly more valuable itemsi meant the existing bpo for the t1 module not a new metabpoless people looting  less supply to meet existing demand  price rise  looting becomes more worthwhile any particular reason who dares wins and lowsec needs something to justify its existence although i realise this particular option would deter the more timid highsec residents like i said im not suggesting this for goonswarms benefiti realise eve isnt intended to be particularly realistic but its always seemed odd that i can blow a hostile ship to pieces and have intact usable modules fall out of the wreck with no repair work required on them at alli dont think requiring 10 minutes of training a rank 1 skill to unlock the ability is going to significantly hamper a new industrialistthanks for your replies so far
i see you havent noticed the difference between material faucet and mineral faucet people run mission to get loot they dont do them specifically for minerals especially as you dont get the minerals you need but instead the mineral that can be produced reprocessing lootloot has plenty of formsremoving loot or making it mostly useless reduce looting and increase the relative injection of isk in the system if massive inflation isnt a negative effect for you it for most people reprocessing a item require a constructed with minerals option to work and is one of the reason why some dev said that making something similar to your proposal would require a lot of work for the development team search in the features and ideas forum for the quote it was about 1 year ago
every step you add on the road to convert a item into isk or something useful reduce the number of people willing to do it i think it would reduce the number of people looting but it is an opinionnot really most of the price increase would be soaked by resellersthe mission runner would sell the items at a lower price than the old operative module resellers would buy then en masse rebuild teens or hundreds of them in one operation and then sell them soaking up the difference very few mission runners would spend the time rebuilding 23 modules at a time to sell then at full price probably the same people that currently is buying modules at less than mineral price would buy broken modules for rebuilding and reselling even less mission runners interested in rebuilding the modules but at least there will not be a proliferation of bpotime sink less interesting than running another missionthat wasnt the meaning of my comment sorry if i offended you the comment meant that most ratters in 00 would hate it i agree it not the 1 skill requiring 10 minutes for the first rank that weight on young players it is the cumulative effect of teen of needed skills at level 1 and more to be really effective from a point of view i like the idea of more complex manufacturing and even of a change in the loot from missions my problem is that eve is a strongly integrated and touching something as sensitive as the industrial part can create big unintended after effects
my impression has always been that people run missions to get isk whether the isk comes from rewards or bounties or selling on valuable meta4 loot or melting down junk loot and selling the minerals or accumulating loyalty points to spend in the store on faction items to sell on arent those just the means to the end i mean if you really really need a 1600mm rolled tungsten plate and one happens to drop in your mission thats great but if something equally valuable drops that you could sell and then use the isk to buy a 1600mm tungsten plate from the market apart from maybe running to the nearest market hub isnt the end result much the samebut the loot isnt mostly useless the broken components are still worth salvaging since theyre needed to construct meta 14 modsgood luck trying to find anything with the search facilities on this forumwait how does metaloot get melted down under the current system then theres no ability for us to construct it using minerals now so what would this change
perhaps but i feel any reduction would be marginal components for popular items are still going to be valuable and worth collecting junk components will be left in space to rot just like junk modules are left to rot currentlyhang on if theyre mass producing metamods then theyre not resellers theyre manufacturersis any aspect of mission running interesting check my corp ticker again its pretty difficult to make a comment id be offended by again i think most 00 ratters would barely notice the difference except that theyd be selling their valuable metaloot to a manufacturing corpmate rather than a fellow ratter or empire exporter it would probably increase industrial activity in our space thoughfair enough although the amount of skills required would obviously depend on the system but the existing manufacturer skills could probably cover it and theres no real reason to add more
why so complicated with re and then production and adding some more items into the database the rats might aswell just drop bpcs with no skill requirements meta0 module and like 2trit1 pyerite as mat requirements
like i said in mechanics terms the broken components would act similarly to a bpc the only problem with using them is that you cant merge bpcs so every module would have to be constructed as an individual manufacturing job which seems needlessly time consuming
not a terrible idea i think its at least worth discussion
not completely original something along this line is proposed weeklyim still not convinced theres a problem other then nerfing missions what exactly do you want to accomplish
seriously someone kill the necromancer
ah hey guy topics already been brought up lets get some thumbs on that threadnot that the csm panel seems to give a damn ive been the first to put forward requests on the topics of discussion threads and theyve completely ignored the desperate entreatyand you think 525 systems is bad try over 1700 which is what i currently must deal with
supported
cant see why not supported
sorry about the caps fixed
im with develdrin on this one this chance is totally unnecessary it is described the way the game calculates it and i dont really see any need to alter that i cant believe people have any difficulties multiplying round figures by five either so this seems more like creating fixes for nonexisting problems
youre right i didnt complain my point was that grids normally arent that bad the reason for making said point was so that he didnt waste time lobbying ccp regarding something they werent responsible for

im strongly in favor drone damage mods
i think his point is that it should be drone damage mods moving them to the highslot is inconsistant with other weapon systems and smacks of i want my domis ogre iis to do hilarious amounts of damage and i want all my lowslots stuffed with armour tank without compromising to fit damage mods there like everyone else does
how about shield tanked domi with fully fitted low slot damage mod with drones and blastersshould be no compromising to fit damage mods if you dont have a high slots in my offerfully fitted 6 drone upgrade unit domi is about 700 dps see them with 6 t2 neutron blasters shield tank and drones

agreed if its just for fighters and fighter bombers
i have supported this but does need more refining and discussioni love the black market idea but i think more content would need to be developed for this to really worki want to discuss missions as i think there is an imbalance with lowsec rewards for standard missions the people who arent newbies that do mission in lowsec do it either for the challengesomething different or because they are pirates and dont have access to high seci think currently the system is very skewed towards the hunterattacker and while balancing this doesnt mean i want more carebears in lowsec it means more corps would be willing to setup in lowsec for better rewards and protect their area which in turn should result in more territorial fightsissues with the current balance  only the lp increases for doing lowsec missions this is only around 13 of the rewards  scanning out mission runners in low sec is too easy now  salvaginglooting is a big component of rewards and you are very much a sitting duck again especially if you hand the mission in so its not dead space probe your exact position not just the first gate  bounties in missions dont change for being in lowsec  possibility of being camped in station or blocked from missions if too many pirates always passing throughnow not all of these need fixing as such but they do add up to mean that lowsec missions just return such a crap reward for the risks and possible denial to run themwith better rewards it would make corpsgroups move out there and fight for their mission spots currently the rewards are so bad high sec corps wouldnt even try this may sound like getting bears in lowsec but to me a bear wont come out even with high rewards these corps are the ones who skip lowsec as even a viable option and go straight out to 00 for the riches out therei really do like the idea of corps of all kinds being able to live in lowsec and live off the area instead of relying on alts for isk yes yes some pirates are very successful but this does seem very dependent on timezone and lowsec in my tz 10 can be fairly quieti think another easy way to boost lowsec is with lootsalvage make the drop dynamic depending on if its  5 or  5 with more higher meta loot and more salvage wormholes were a good proof that some highsec players not care bears will go to where the profits are people die in whs but a lot still do it because the rewards are great enough to factor in a loss every now and thengcc timer  i think this should be a bit more dynamic say in 1 its only 5mins and scales up to 15mins at 4 space though even i feel 15mins is too much sometimes if your in a small ship you are very limited in what you can do and most of the time i dock up or cloak while i wait out the timer it seems a waste of time when you only have 12 hours to playone thing i dont want happening in lowsec is buying protection from gate guns so they dont shoot you with gcc stations guns im not sure on yet

games are for playing not for investing
i do support this although i have little to do with this it seems unfair to me although ccp should be the first one to care about it
when i spent a summer contemplating putting my account on hold for rl financial reasons i asked in some channels about this the answer i remember most clearly was i hate it when people answer this question it just competes with my own datacore pricesthat tells me right there that someone likes abusing this and doesnt want it to be a commonplace thing i have no idea how prevalent a practice it is but a stable of latent characters should be just that latent if this change causes someone to not want to use their research alts anymore they are still able to be sold for a boost to isk just like any other account the isk they have already generated since 2003 has paid out billions to those whove been around just my own active account has made close to a billion isk in datacore sales in two yearspassive income is nice but this is beyond passive this is comatose i dont understand why ccp didnt stop rp production the same as sp accumulation in inactive accounts and i do believe that market orders and contracts should be affected as well but this certainly needs addressed
i am liking the ideas i am reading and i think putting some together would be good tooputting the sov units outside the system but joining them together with a repair effectall sov units must be under attack in amount greater then their tanks can hold if not they will repair each other an thus make them all unbreakable below 50 total hp until the last units are being hit if a sov unit is under attack and it has friendly units in the area they are unbreakable below 75 but the friendly force has to equal lets say 2550 of the attacking forces numbersthis will cause both attackers and defenders to split their forces at make choices on the battlefield it will also limit mobility in itself because removing ships could cause the ratio to change and toss all systems into a situation that owuld repair the sov unitsfeel free to play wiht he numbers as i am just tossing them out there but that would remove the need for blobs but this would also require lowering the hp of targets as their would e a limited number of ships that could be use to fire on them in all situationhow does that sound
that would be total hot cakes id love it just for the obscure pointless difficulties it would createim supportinging this anyways though
as long as its the mwd not the ab because the mwd goes faster and i agree that the trailes should be longer with a mwd make the trails last for as long as it does when your hull is almost down exept coming out the the engines with the ab make it last double the current distance
i never confused them but a different icon would be appreciated
this would be nice yeah
may i then say the the f o or c be on the topright side of the card this leaves the left side clear for tlevel and the like
supported storyline items need a different tag too and yes put it in the top right corner so top left corner can be used for tech levels

well im seeing some more characterrelated threads so im hoping to get some more support for this idea seems like some small coding on the back end for a winwin for allthanks for taking the time to look
we sooo need to get this brought up to ccp i know theirs rumors their working on improved effects but it should be made a high priority
you know the only problem i have with all of this is the smoke trails that everyone is talking about all over this threadi dont think there is any smoke in space even on engines like what the space shuttle uses in space what is being burned is a perfect combination of fuels it doesnt leave any remains behind like smoke just the molecules created after the interaction of the two fuel parts kind of like how hydrogen and oxygen when combined wont leave smoke behind just the h2o molecules created by the combination although on earth the intense heat could burn other molecules and leave a bit of smoke behindanyway anything that leaves a smoke trail isnt supported by me same with giant explosions they just wouldnt be that big in space unless it was the fuel source exploding in which case it could be very big depending on that fuel source rather than the ship size for instance it is completly possible that an interceptor with a mwd would create a bigger boom than a battleship if the engine doesnt go which it shouldnt always explode then the explosion would be limited by the oxygen in the ship in fact most ships would simply vent the atmosphere or fracture apart with very small explosions if any it all depends on how it was destroyedbasically i would rather see things be realistic instead of shiny and graphics intense
facepalmsoyeahsupport the op
whatever happened to ccp fear and his statement in dev blog of 20080806 that removal of insurance in concord events will be implemented in the near future if ccp were planning to make this change why did they change their minds  is there a link to comments from anyone in ccp i couldnt find any
it was explained at length and in detail to fear why that would be a very bad idea and the proposal was put in a bag and drowned as it deserved to beinsurance is irrelevant to small ships being used for ganking losing 10 of the price of a battleship will make casual bs ganks uneconomic but you if you remove insurance altogether then you have undesirable effects like making npc corp freighters orcas etc effectively invulnerable you have to remember that suicide ganking isnt wrong its not cheating or undesirable or unintended or exploiting or griefing and while it arguably needs rebalancing it doesnt need eliminating
i agree with the idea that insurance premiums should fluctuate with average mineral prices on a regular adjustment schedule every 7 days or month is really the way it should go fixed prices just doesnt make sense when everything else in the economy fluctuates with supply and demandi do also think that payouts from being concorded or selfdestructing should be reduced to half or completely eliminated it makes absolutely no sense that either situation would grant full insurance payout
once insurance payouts are lower than mineral value selfdestructing will pretty much stop since it will always be better to reprocess the ship for minerals as for making sense coherency takes a back seat to game balance if youre going to eliminate insurance for concorded ships in the name of good sense then fair enough but we will have to abandon the idea of concord of being omnipotent invincible and omniscient and working for free since that doesnt make any sense either if concord beome falliable unreliable and escapable then i have no problem with removing insurance for concord killsin any case i dont want this thread to become about suicide ganking there have been more than enough discussions about that this one is about reforming the way insurance is calculated
supported it is done for corp hangars  really  why hasnt this already been implemented for personal hangars  also  change it from 7 tabs to at least 8 and so you dont even have to use all 8 but at least give option to players if they want one they get one if they want 8 tabs they get 8 etc etc change this for corp hangars as well that way players in corp can each get a tab that can be locked out from other players in corp permissionsgetting back to the thread though for the personal hangar tabs make it local client cacheable so the server doesnt have to remember it and then it is just a matter of a coding change and not a resource hog great idealets make it happen
i support improving the organization of assets especially by allowing the assets search function to include items stored in station containersbut  i recognize that this will add significantly to the database that is being searched currently i have 10 mission hubs each with 5 station containers full of an average of 200 different items if my search function is going to have to include these various metacommodityrefinableetc items it could add additional latency to the assets  search menu instead of searching a list of 50 items it will be searching a list of 10000 itemscould we allow items inside station containers to be repackaged directly instead of having to be dragged to the items menu firstthis would reduce the number of items in my mission fittings station container and make fitting slightly easier
only problem i can see is people grinding out slaves to make isk aka fly to one port and turn slaves into free people make a little isk take all the free people to another station and turn them into slaves make a little isk sooner or later you could see freighter loads of slaves being moved around then again maybe this would be a little more realistic than the hold ornaments they are at the moment
i propose that ccp go back and add a ship crew amount to the show info on ships i know some maybe thinking its a pod no crew but if you look you will find a live stock item ships crew show info for it is a noncapsuleer member of a ships crew relegated to manual tasks essential for maintaining the operational status of the ship so ships have people besides you on them and personally i would like to know just how many people die when i lose a ship or blow up someone elses
assuming a 100 mortality rate caused by the explosion all of themyou may have noticed i didnt tic the box to support this asinine proposal this is just to indicate that was not by mistake

this needs to be addressed along with updating the information on the drones based on skills and equipment just like any other weapon system drones need to be treated like a part of the game and not a pariah by the programmers i recognize that they cause problems with server load and such but surely there is something that could be done

this would be a neat feature to seeeventually
considering the discussion so far in this thread i think it would be a better use of ccp resources to simply develop a more robust keybinding system this would solve both the keybinders problem as well as those who wish to use programs like voice buddysupporting through not supporting
no you clearly referenced missioners as you inferred they have big effing guns you meant to imply this gives them some kind of advantage to try to claim otherwise is entirely disingenous
the new possibility of abandoning wrecks should at least open up the possibility of revisiting this subject regardless of past discussionsmost of the time i dont personally care neither about the loot nor the salvage the new possibility of abandoning wrecks enables me to express this explicitly the extremely few times i do care its very annoying to have someone come in and salvage them with complete impunity those times even if its not defined as stealing it sure feels like itand i fail to see how this would threaten salvaging as a profession as i said most just leave the wrecks there and can now mark them as abandoned which should leave plenty of opportunities for salvaging
several years ago miners and mission runners were complaining about jet can thieves and wanted to introduce some sort of flagging to combat the problemthey got ithow often to mission runners and miners fire on can flippersloot thieves not very often why because they usually come back in bigger ships you mission runners really dont know whats good for you in your mind noob comes along and steals your salvage flagging himself you one volley him with your golem and go for a self congratulatory dance with madam palm and her five lovely daughtersin reality noob flags himself you either one volley him or force him to warp out what the hell its only a destroyer he returns in a battlecruiser sized ship maybe with logistics backup maybe not to come and ruin your day he does so and takes your loot and your tearsjust accept that your loot cant be touched and enjoy the fact that youre still making more from bounties rewards loot and lp in a single mission than he will in an evening
intended game mechanics and good game mechanics are not always same thingoh yes mission runners never get shot at or anythingminers usually run around their day armed with bling ship and 8 weapons rightwhy should i earn money for myself and someone who is lazy to do it
the point is that you assume that salvage is urs by default its not and it was never meant to be you have gotten used to something that was never intended to benefit you as a missioner runner specifically but you just happen to get a head start on everyone else in getting to it first
oh noes not this topic again   htfu m8 o
well after the amout of come back from the pvp comunity i feel that as a mission runner the term not welcome is being firmly put at my door im sorry if i have put my foot in the big boys pool by mistake i only wish to raise an issue that the pve players feel is unfair yes you can shoot me and most likly kill me but i would still like the oppertunity to salvage the mission if as you say salvage is not mine then seperate the two have the wreck spawn as a white triangle and the loot spawn as a yellow can then there can be no mistake to who owns whati would also like to ask how many of you who posted here live in empire space and play the pve gamethere is an unfairness to the salvage ownership issue that should be resolvedas this keeps cropping up maybe its time to look again at thisagain i appologise for spoiling your forum with my request
this thread is now about why we dont have a thumbs down check boxsrslyno i didnt read the thread
i run missions also and theres plenty of opportunity to salvage the mission if you fit a tractor and salvager on your mission ship more often than not youll get the most of it if a ninja shows up well thats too bad now you have competitionbut thats what the game is all aboutmaybe it would help to suggest that salvage doesnt actually exist until someone with a salvage module creates it since it doesnt exist there is no ownership and thus no flagging
i only was interrupted once to see the salvager killed by the rats yet that is not the point i believe that since i created the loot and the wreck they both belong to me and someone taking it deserves to die if he cannot not defend himself another reason for this is that ninja salvaging is the most risk free profession in the whole of eve after maybe sitting in station all day and manufacturing
really were having this discussion againloot  yours by defaultsalvage  doesnt even exist until someone hits it with a salvager how can you lay a claim to something that doesnt yet exist
riddle me this empire mission runners how often have you actually fired on someone who has come into your mission and taken your loot what was the end result i guarentee if things were changed you would still not engage ninja salvagers for fear of being ganked afterwards
thrice once i lost a raven to a trap once a catalyst narrowly escaped and the third time an anathema got popped by the rats that were scramming him thoroughly enjoyed all three encounters
who cares if it flags you or not id take it either way just like i take all the loot in the wrecks i and plenty of other ninjas look forward to getting into pvp its not a punishmentsupported
you would be much better in pvp then also if this by some mistake is implemented i probably will move to live in mission hub no not for missions why some of you even think that there is much difference between miner ship and a pve fitted ship against pvp fitted they both will melt horribly also you will find out very soon that a using very expensive ships isnt good idea then you soon will discover also the curse of mission specific tank then you will start to omni tank t1 bs then you will find out that active tank is  for pvp atm and will end with a river of tears and post why you cant do missions as quick as before whine will never stop if you feel salvaging isnt fair i got a news flash for you its a eveonline not a world of spacecraft you allready got to much advantages with lvl4 who the hell told that in lvl4 has a risk i propose the mission rat to be made much stronger with less bounty and to pod when they destroy your ship also its time for mission pirates to discover the toys of other races all mission to jam scram web and all other ew at once i want to be possible to use a bubbles in deadspace in empire this will prevent a gate camping but will effect this gods of whine and then mark the salvage as they want i feel it fair and right as all of you wow in space whiners feel about salvaging
if you crash your car can i have the engine and everything else thats left guess what noif you house burns can i have all the furniture thats left overthe salvage exists it just takes some skill to get it out and guess what all recyclable trash is my property unless i say otherwise and you cannot have itive killed suiside gankers and ninja salvagers multiple times some of them are damn stupid i really love how everyone panics that missions runners will be able to shoot salvagers the only absolutely risk free proffestion in eve you can sit in noobcorp and enjoy complete invulnerability
so if you can kill them its not risk free so what you talk about if you are able to shoot them only when they do something wrong this is the same case as mission runner died in mission it is impossible to die if you dont do something wrong if you talk about risk what about missions we know that ppl buy a new golem every week right also learn to play damn game if you wont be probbed dont use a ships which signature is big as a star tengu or put a eccm on the ship seriously where the heck do you read that eve is a realistic game class of ships is borked guns mechanics is bul aka orbiting stopped ship warping is nothing like real world laws your ship is a giant ball for the code and so on
how can it be risk free if youve killed multiple of them
very well since the salvage already exists please point at the part of the wreck that is the melted capacitor console prior to you using the salvage module on itill waitbtw if i crash my car it still belongs to me because the law says so if you wreck a ship at sea it belongs to whomever finds it and recovers the wreckage once again because the law says so by your logic the wreck should belong to the captainwhich real life example do you suppose is more apt hereand while were on the subject you salvaging the windshield of my wrecked car doesnt make the rest of the wreck suddenly vanish  oh thats right this is a game i keep forgetting that
bla bla weve got one camp calling it intended game mechanics on the one side and another camp calling it stupid game mechanics on the other sideas ccp is unlikely to change said game mechanics for that these kinds of threads have been way too numerous why not make the distinction clear once and for all after all the mechanics are in place to do so already make the wrecks spawn empty blue abandoned freeforall make the loot spawn as a can owned by the missionrunner  ratterthere no more discussion its painfully obvious what is whose end of discussionthis will however spawn more objects in space i know a node craps out at about a 1000 pvpers in 1 00 system i dont know how busy for instance motsus node is so im not the one to judge if this will cripple the node
no  because in game lag is of much greater importance than forum whine spam
thanks paul the wise that would be a dream solution as the mos i see in the systems i use is 250300 often much less than thatand seen as this is not a 00 issue then there should be no problem with this solutionthanks for the imput
macro miners helping the economy is just plain ignorant and probably the voice of a macro user macro mining needs to stop because not everyone starts out in 00 space they need to flag miners who warp back and forth to bookmarks for hours no miner will continually travel back and forth for hours on end the macros have changed to fly under the radar by setting bookmarks in different belts this breaks up their travel giving the appearance of someone going to a new belt belt rats with more jamming devices would just slow them down i made a point to mine roids macros were hitting as soon as the roids disappeared they were hitting other roidsthere are taletell signs of a macro but ccp will not end macro mining since they are constantly fixing new features they bring out macros are in pretty much every system in high sec and ccp has no interest in stopping them otherwise they would i recently came back to the game after quitting in hopes they would stop cheating or take an interest in it and attempt to slow it down the only way ccp will take interest in it is if it or goons take an interest in it we know it is dev ran so if macro mining is to stop goons will need to employ it the only time ccp takes real interest in anything is if goons are doing it everyone knows that
ship explosions and wrecks arent very realistic especially capital shipsugly to see

i like the idea id like to see how it would affect the overall faction market though
my mission running is caldari so i dont benefit from it and i still endorse it common sense really
supporting this
this is true however you lose your ship  it has nothing to do with smartbombingyou made a mistake and you paid for it just like any other type of combat in eveyour option to fight back start when you select your warp in rangewarp to 0 comes with a risk attached if your in a ship that cant withstand a disco bsyou can 100 remove this risk by not warping to 0 in a line from another gateyou need to recognise the point at which possible pvp encounters startsthis point is the range you decide to warp in at it is the same for any other type of pvp  come in at a favourable range you may win  come in at a bad range you may loseid have to say nosmartbombing has allready been nerfed it used to be possible to bomb at a gatestation at zerosmartbombing can not now be performed within a range that will hit the stationgatethis means its impossible to smartbomb at the point where your ship is out of warp smartbombs at a gate station can only hit you whilst your passing through the aoe in the last moments of warpand btw if your grid is not loading whilst your coming out of warp to a gate then you need a faster modem
i guess someone hasnt fought in 00ex lowsec smartbomber here not supported what you are proposing would make lowsec perfectly safe for shuttles and fast frigs when this problem is only limited to three or four high traffic lowsec pipes its very simple to avoid smartbomb camps its also pretty easy to tank up a frig to be able to take a volley of bombs
i agree ships that are still warping shouldnt take damageedit i just read larkoniss reply and now i dont knowi am entirely against unbeatable ships people or strategies that are always risklessbut at the same time i think that ships shouldnt be dying in warpalso i hate that tactic sitting 5k off a gate in a smartbombing bs with warp core stabs fitted so much that my opinion is biased i mean cmon go find real targets or go play wow yeah i dont know
ive done plenty of 00 and low sec pvp im not asking for smartbombs to be nerfed eitheri would like to see a fix to where a ship can not be blown up while in warpwhen you first enter warp your ship stops taking damage and as such when coming out of warp your ship should still not take damage until the warp drive turns offperhaps make it to where stargates or not targetable so that one would have to fire a smartbomb at another pilot in order for that tactic to work im all for pvp but im not for losing a ship while in warp
and as i said its easily avoidable and will make fast frigs and shuttles traversing lowsec invulnerable
its called fitting a tank

supported for 1vs1 cause some ppl dont have fleet members at their disposal for jumping in to interfere at a moments notice and theres not much they can do besides  and moan about it either and never duel again to see whos better
having the option to disrespect duels is part of what makes eve worth playing lame though it may be it gives eve its dark and somewhat realistic flavour ill take consequences in the form of loss of trust  bad reputation over easier agreedupon duels anyday duel people who deserve it and you will rarely if ever have problems with them trying to get their gang to gank you
i believe a rightclick grant aggression option would suffice at a small fee read bribe payable to concord

theres room in the world for football  boxing as well as warcurrently eve only simulates wararenas could be the eve equiv of football  boxingas long as its to the death i dont see a problem with having combat contained to similar forces on each sideand if we can gamble on the results even betteryes to arenas

imo this is kind of redundant by default everyone on the forums is not supporting a proposal because it takes an active step to select the support button it would make more sense to just start every proposal off with 400000 nonsupportsone for every active accountissues that are highly contested generally spawn longer threads filled with debate from both sides i trust the csms judgment to navigate those and understand enough to formulate a respectable position on the issue in the case of proposals with almost no supportgenerally opposed by the overall ah communitythe op usually disappears shortly after the first page and the thread dies not long after
this proposal has been brought up a few times and is part of the package of improvements to the assembly hall forum tools
i like the idea have both supported and notsupported options make them a bit more prominent than the current checkbox and have the tally of each or a  value displayed on the opsupportedfor that matter please disable the support and if added not support options when replying to a thread youve already voted on its very annoying as it is now that you dont know unless you scan through all the posts for your name and if you try to reply with support to an already supported thread it trips the 5 minute posting timer
this is true and holds true to the storyline of eve and news reports ore needs to respond to the demands of the capsuleers maybe even a new ship like a suped up retriever but that has a massive tank but only 2 strips smaller hold than a hulk but like i said major tanking ability
i think the premise is sound any large mining vessel would by neccessity require a massive hull and as a civilian vessel have little armor and shielding
a badly made pic of what i meanplease visit your user settings to reenable imageseditsorry for nutty size too used to high res
this sounds like a great idea not only is it helpful like mentioned but i also think eves ship interface what we spend 100 of our time looking at pretty muchis pretty much underpowered and for lack of a better term kind of lame in other words it is not as realistic as a spaceship would be a few extra gauges is what one would imagine would be present to a pilot now obviously the game doesnt call for much and one does not want to overclutter the screne as the overview does a great job but just adding something more like velocitymomentum etc like this would class it up a bit and add some realism imho

the issuance of a rookie ship is a stopgap from a player losing all of his game possesions and isk and thus making it impossible to recover from the loss of a ship the rookie ship always gives the player the ability to kill the easiest of npcs in a rookie ship and progress in the game however slowly however for msot players the rookie ship is an annoyance that causes mroe problems than it solvesi have several hundred lose rookie ships and bits of tritanium floating around in random stations i will never visit not because i lost a ship and needed it but because i decided to fly to a station in my pod these items only clutter up the assets tab and most importantly causes undue database load on the server there should be an option on the esc menu to optout of being given a new rookie ship and the ability to opt back in at any timethis could also apply to the annoying scc mails every time i dock in a pod although the new mail system males it easy to delete them all easilywhat does everyone think is this just an annoyance for me or do others have the same issues
right click  trashproblem solved
this is the reason i never even consider clicking the assets tab now
its pretty annoying but trashing it every time you dock in a pod isnt really that big a burden

open mail  notifications  delete allits fairly annoying and would be nice to disable not terribly high priority
i have noticed quite a few times that players get into heated arguments and would like to fight but both parties are worried about taking the first shot and being concorded consider the idea of issuing duelling permits as a way for dealing with this situation a player would have the option of selecting a notification for a duel to send to the other player if this offer is accepted both parties would make payments of one million isk each to concord to resolve their differences this would add another dimension to the gamehow about some commission on the idea lol

drop a can not supported
lets say you have a group of probes out all set to 8au scan rangeyou do you scan and find the signature your afteryou drop the range on all probes down to 42auproblem  the bubbles on your probes no longer overlap so each probe has to be moved inward to make the probes overlapmy proposal is thiswhen you grab the edge of a bubble and shift drag it to resize all probes the probes should move inwards  outwards towards there common center to maintain the amount of overlap you have setthis way as you change range on probes you only have to reposition the group  rather than constantly having to reposition each probe manually
from what i remember this was on the agenda for dominion but was dropped so i would expect we will see something like this in the future
i am against making scanning too easy i dislike this proposal
not easier  just less fiddly

as the title says make it so sov outposts and player owned stations should have mentioned
engagebut yeh i agree give you something worth fighting for
agreed an indestructable station is the dumbest thing ever i want my ship built out of whatever compound a stations built out of
sure although nobody would leave anything of value on those stations then so it wouldnUFFFDt be much of an improvementi think we should be able to break into other peoples hangers and steal their stuff in all stations
siege stations with titansno really that would be kinda cool
supporting my own topic
now that would be cool d
buhu i do believe the op is refering to conquerable stations and outposts many of which probably contain countless billions worth of stuff left by previous owners if there is a way of working around the problems this causes and the means of destroying a 00 outpost are made sufficiently time and resource intensive maybe requiring a couple of titans on grid chargin their lazors for an hour or two when the station exits its last rf timerwhile people may be concerned about supercap proliferation i for one am more bothered about outpost proliferation
this is really needed make it happen
that would be even worse because everyone and their mother would just flock in cursefountain and whatever else npc stations there are in 00 those should be destructible just as well if you go this route
are you retiredif you keep more than a bils worth of stuff in a conquerable station at the moment then youre being pretty foolish given that npc space would fill up pretty quick and running logistics to the deeper regions for moons and stuff would be somewhat difficult people would still use outpostsas i said as long as it was made time and resource intensive enough to destroy or ruin an outpost theres not going to be a problem
blowing up the largest manmade objects that exist in eve sure make them only destroyable by doomsdays justified by unbelievably resilient and selfrepairing superstructure nearly impossible to destroy ps give us deathstars i want to blow up someones disposium moon as well
already raised in csm 1 and rejected
it makes sense that outposts and pos should be destructible not saying it should be by any means easy but it certainly should be possible given enough time and resourcessupported
ccp could implement it so that once the station is destroyed it no longer becomes possible to dock and all jump clones are destroyed then once the next downtime comes around the station is removed and replaced with a station wreck the wreck would be permanent and anyone who had itemsships in the station could eject them from the station also anyone in the station when it is converted to a wreck would still be able to undock but they would get a warning that says that they will not be able to dock back upedited for support
as much as id love to see this it will not happen at least for now ccp has already stated that it was their original intention to make outposts destructible but the main coding problem that kept them from realizing this feature was what would happen to all the pilots logged out at said station once it blew up as far as people not using stations if they were destructible that is completely absurd do you even live in 00losing a station to an enemy alliance can shut you out of that station almost as permanently as the station blowing up for good if you have half a brain and live in 00 you know that it is never wise to stockpile all your assets in one conquerable station or outpost
they are already moving people out of jita station while loggin in  if theres to many people in systemjust apply the same principle to the nonexistent outpostssupporting

ccp finally came to realize that the delay on the character screen that shows all the information about the character was not as good of an idea as they had hoped so they got rid of it now whenever i am trying to fit my ship there is this annoying delayanimation where all the slots have the load in this long circle motion and by time it is done i have waited several unnecessary seconds before i can continue with my work its an unnecessary addition to the game that serves no purpose that i can see sure maybe it looked nice the first time you ever opened the screen by as with many common task with unnecessary animationdelays it just becomes plain annoying after a while therefore i would like that that animation be removed andor shortened to about the time it takes to get my cursor from the left side of the screen to the first highslot on the fitting window

option supported as mentioned before gases or any heavy animation will drop your comps fps by a lot and thats even more so if ure not zoomed all the way out even if u need to actually see something up close zoom in enough and watch your game stutter like crazy same problem goes for bubble animationsi dont mind the graphics looking like absolute  as long as my losses were due to reasonable causes as long as its not fps issues despite everything turned all the way down i think i can live with crappier graphics especially an inanimate bubble as opposed to a pulsating electrified one
warningactual real science content aheadbut of course the fact that there are habitable world with indiginous life in the eve cluster puts its age at 24b years old at the youngeststellar nurseries consume there gas within a few 10s to 100s million years meaning the eve cluster should be completelly devoid of any sort of nebulasnot that id argue for there removal on that groundsid argue for there removal on the grounds that they just have no wow factor because of there ever present nature120 systems with a pretty nebula would be more than enough for moi

changed ur mind already lol
some recent post about repopulating low sec had me thinking about low sec missions and the autobalancerfor those that dont know about it the autobalancer is a program used by ccp that balance missions rewards base pay lp bonus timer and bonus payout to the average time used to successfully complete the missionwhat is the problem lets make an esamplemission a is done by 10 pod pilots 9 in high sec 1 in low sec thanks to better ships and no interruptions the high sec players complete the mission in 20 minutes the low sec pilot need 60 minutes the autobalancer look the completion timer and say 209  16010  24 so average completion time is 24 minutes and assign as a reward to the mission 12 millions as payout 12 millions as bonus and 2400 lp totally hypothetic numbers those number are then multiplied by a modifier based on the security level of the system as we all know the security level of a system as a very low impact on missioning what really matter is if is high sec low sec or 00 00 is a kind of middle ground as missioning risk my suggestion is to split the data gathering from missions with a set of data for high sec one for low sec and one for 00 while removing the sec system modifier or greatly reducing its effect as it make a small difference for suicide ganking in high sec so after enough missions have been done so that the autobalancer has gathered sufficient data to start adjusting the rewards we would get something like thismission a average completion time in high sec 20 minutes base reward 1 million bonus reward 1 million lp 2000 average completion time in low sec 60 minutes base reward 3 millions bonus reward 3 millions lp 6000  average completion time in 00 40 minutes base reward 2 million bonus reward 2 millions lp 4000this way the rewards would be more strictly tied to the effective difficulty of a mission when you take environmental effects in consideration it would be even better if the data are gathered based on the security level of the system where the mission is done and not of the system where the agent is located as currently happen that will reduce the effect of people gaming the system so they get level 5 missions in high sec and avoid penalizing those that get a low sec mission from a high sec agentthought and comments
your under the impression that lowsec missioners are interrupted ive had days and days of never seeing reds set foot in our system so balancing under your system  terrible also this sounds easy to abuse this whole balance it because big bad piwates are at my door deal no support
supporting myself now that the 5 minutes timer has ended ccp please change the mechanic so that we can support our own proposal directly with the first post if is verys trange when the proponent dont support his own proposalthe autobalancer use completion time so if low sec missions arent interrupted the average time and the reward would be the same as high sec as it happen todaythe only difference would be that people will not get a automatic payout multiplier for doing them in a 05 system instead of a 10 system what is terrible in thatapparently a lot of people feel that low sec missions need some extra bonus and this seem a decent way to do that
a related issue is that sec status does not accurately reflect the real danger level of a lowsec system perhaps lowsec sec status should be autobalanced instead something like danger level  number of illegal aggressions for over last 15 dayslowsec system truesec would be danger level normalized into 001  049 range update daily weekly monthlyso places like ama and rancer would be around 001 while less popular lowsec systems would get a higher sec status  then lowsec sec status would actually mean something and mission running would get payouts proportionate to the actual threat of hanging around in the system in question
like ive said id expect any mission nerf as a result of this to be small missioners would still get their bounties rewards loyalty points salvage standings the loot would still retain a large amount of its current value what id like to see from this ultimatelywould be the mineral market based on mining rather than largely propped up by melted down loot mostly id like to see a reason for people to mine the highends in 00 and lowsec although lowsec needs other aspects fixing before anyone sane would go there to mine without constantly being undercut by infinite mission loot appearing out of thin air
one of the big questions and only ccp can answer to it ishow much of the minerals are supplied by mission lootand what percentage of the players are supplying that lotin august 2008 last data ccp gave approximately 40 of the minerals did come from reprocessing not including drone alloys but that percentage included modules used for mineral compression reprocessed ships and even t2 reprocessed ships and modules 1 of all morphite did come from reprocessing and no nondrone mission loot include morphitegathering those data today would be even more difficult that in the past as there is a large number of ships that are melted to recover the minerals but if ccp can get some clear data cleared as much as possible from the distortions created by mineral compression items and ship reprocessing it would be very interestingespecially if they can add the manhour spent mining and missioning or a least the number of players involved for a better comparison
unfortunately there are not nearly enough industrialists on this forum all ideas to clean up and streamline the market or corporate delivery interfaces falls completely on dead earsits been put forward for examination on each of the last three csm discussion periods and been flatly ignored for the standard pvpcentric issues yes they are issues that need to be addressed but there are more than just those

fyi there is a missing con to this makes directional scanning for probes easier being someone on both sides of the fence this is important to to note if scan probes are allowed on the overview i would set up a probe only overview just for simple sorting at the times i would need it currently all the garbage you have to sort though provides at least some difficulty in seeing probesthen again your back to the the other side when i am baiting salvage ninjas it is very frustrating sorting though 150 items on a scan just to scroll down to where the probes are just so i can see if a mark is looking for meso in the end its the same pro and con for this one it just depends on how ccp wants to handle pilots ability to look for probesedit thank you for the speedy delivery of the minutes
good ideas coming in this does need attentionso lets keep it atthe toplowsec should be a fun immersive environment all on its own notg just a middle ground for hi and 00so get to the top and get more ideas inlets get lowsec noticed and acted upon
remove insurance payoff if ship was lost in lowsecnullsecinstead for lowsec add bounty on account not character who blown the ship as percent of insurance payoff of course dont add bounty if you was defending etcor allow player to choose when he killed how much of insurance goes to bounty on killer how much to his wallet but generally lowsec insurance payoff to wallet should get like 25 penaltyobviously trial accounts shouldnt be able to train ewar thenproportional bounty will be payed to anyone doing collateral damage to accounts of any character property but less than cost of lost property lets say you have 1 bil on you head now you have to lost like 10 megathrons assume each costs 130 mil to clear in off or pay fine your killers will receive 100 mil on each killnullsec damage doesnt countsadd fast giving pvp missions to hunt highbounty outlaws with realtime update if they spotted near gate or stationadd rare pve pirate faction stations at deep lowsecadd cheap pirate faction ships without basic insurance in those stations in contrast all other ships always have some basic insurance disallow appearing in highsec in ships without basic insurance or pay fine on entry and thus insuring shipadd modulesskills to do pirating without revealing identity and thus avoiding hurting sec status and receiving bounties longer fightbigger fleet  less chances to save anonymity fighting near stations reveals identity immediatelyadd pirate faction fast giving pvp missions about ships with costly modules or freight with realtime update pve rats can scan and report or just randomlymake ships unable to warp to 0 to gate in lowsecadd some kind of pirate faction gates maybe onetimed dynamic  timedadd rare concord patrols in lowsec killable with good loot but with modules outlawed in highsecmake some pve authorities come to gatestation if someone smartbombing etc it for too longadd pirate faction missions of defending rats from mission runners but still must be run under coverremove local autopermajoin make local autopermajoin only in highsecetc etc etcthere are 101 way to make lowsec lively placeimagine it peoples will stop blowing shuttles for giggles lots of mission runners miners traders will move into lowsec some clever stealthy pirates with good skills and high pirate faction standings will be able to do good harvesting of pimped ships some pirate huntersgangs will make money by hunting em lowsec will become lively risky but rewarding interesting place
this  why ccp just lets it languish there is beyond me but i suppose i should have a bit of patience

splendid idea  fully supported
as a self proclaimed drone  i fully support these ideas
i support the idea of an improved drone interface in general i think that the op has a good vision and has clearly thought out the utility of what he is proposingi think the few naysayers in this post also raise some good points too i am a dominix pilot and i can fully appreciate the abuse which could be perpetrated by afk missioning if these changes were executed i would appreciate seeing something like this in the general settings menu as a few more choices beyond what is already there i would also like to see those settings given a prioritization function so that you could say ahead of time whether an optimal range target a frigate or an ewar ship is the first thing that your drones go after there are options there already and if ccp could get the drones we have to adhere to those commands without going rogue like they do it would be a huge improvementi do very much support the idea of an ignore command that could be applied to pvp intys or spawn triggers i swear that drones now are scripted to target these things preferentially just to make drone pilots suffer for being drone pilots

makes good sense to me
when anything burns you get c02 and h20 both of which would freeze into crystals in space so it would be a crystal trail rather then a smoke trail but a trail nonetheless

true but on the other hand you nor i have any idea whatsoever how much if any lag this will causethe only systems i get lag in are jita and nobodys missioning there and fleetfights could restrict the feature to npc wrecks player wrecks are still ffa but not as obvious if its that much of an issue
seems unnecessary to me to create twice the numbers of space crap jusy to ram home an ownerships issue that already exists
if the amount of junk is the problem shorten the ttl for wrecks and cans to one and a half hours that will work to lessen lag everywherecan you please allow players who have no interest in 00 or low sec to have an issue addressed with out damning it as whining i have no interest in the politics and mass pvp of evei enjoy the game for the pve elementi pay my subscription the same as everyone elsethe ninja salvager is like some one running on to the green and kicking your golf ball in to the distance shouting goal after you spent time getting it to the tee
so because you dont like what ppl here have taken the time to set you straight on they are all just 00  losec pvpers come to troll not quite mate you are just horribly wrong and we are pointing it out for the 100th time at least
if you must quote real world examples i will once again quote how marine salvage rights work in the real worldwell assume that wrecks in eve are abandoned in that sense in that the rats flying them are deadnow the cargothus under this law the cargo is the property of the owner of the ship in eve this would be the pirates corp but is awarded to the player instead but as the ship is abandoned salvage rights are available to anyone who gets there firstof course you could point to wreckage in that second quote as being the same as a wreck in eve but in that isnt the case a wreck object in eve is the remains of the ship itself not wrecked cargo which would be the wreckage referred to in the uk lawthus the current system is actually an improvement over rl player is awarded the cargo ownership instead of the rats corp whilst remaining in the spirit of the law salvage rights of the ship are separate to the cargojust saying
all very good pointsunfortunately the salvage is mine camp arent interested in logic td as they prove everytime this thread comes aroundedit quoting failure
 the carebear would have to leave its own npc corp to do so ps this reply made me spit out my gatorade
stop playing the game thats the only way ccp will understand when player growth in empire stops
good but then let me translate that quote to everisking his life and property  undockingproperty of another  pretty self explanatoryperil  being salvaged by the one who created the wreck in the first placei think this nicely sums up the issue were trying to discus  main point being ofc the property of another part the wreck and hence the salvage the salvage doesnt exist yet is a technicality no wreck no salvage is created by the missioner and as hes the one risking his ship he is after all being shot at its not all that strange he feels the salvage is rightfully his too
so what youre saying is if i go out on the seas and sink a boat i should have the right to be its salvor because im risking my life and property to rescue the property of another from perilyou carebears truly are a sick demented twisted lotseek psychiatric help
no ap theyre misinterpreting the definition of the word salvor most likely on purposethe salvor isnt the person who makes the wreck it is the person who salvages it
no if you go out to sea and sink a bout you should be shot for the pirate you areif however said sinking would be legal and you would be allowed to loot everything that comes from it flotsam jetsam whatever you should probably also be the one that gets first rights to be salvorthe original quote illustrated this prior to a salvage attempt the salvor receives permission from the owner or the master to assist the vessel owner or master thats under discussion but as the flotsam and jetsam rights have been transferred by concord from the npc to the carebear and on op of that the npc is dead its no stretch to state the owner or master in the comparison would be the carebearrl comparisons dont map to eve 11 as in eve pvany ship out there  go out to sea and sink a boat you are risking life and property because the npc and players if you engage in pvp will shoot back well life npcs wont pod you but it can hardly be called a rescue from peril the only peril the wreck faces is being despawned well boohoo the only risk a ninja takes is undocking and they are not rescuing anything hence the comparison without explanation is flawed a marine salvor requests permission if it isnt abandoned actually risks something has to do a hell of a lot more work than warp in take a beer and press f1 through f4i got the definition quite right i think you either didnt understand my random gibberish or youre trying to sidetrack the discussion by misinterpreting my crystal clear explanation truth will be somewhere in between i guess but its always more easy to go to some end of an extreme call the opposing party a sick demented twisted lot and stop arguing because youve proved your point commonly known as a straw man and they are unfortunately all too easy as there probably isnt a single comparison that fits 100
a note on bookmarks any smart miner also uses bookmarks  carefully planning hisher attack on a belt from preset positions that ensure that the lasers cover every last rockno proposal that relies on detecting bookmarks is reasonableadditionally legitimate miners will fly back and forth in a hightraffic system with lots of can flippers so that idea is of marginal use as welli dont like macro miners holding down the price of ore i could be mining more profitably but i have not yet seen any solution that didnt take the fun out of being a legitimate miner or target legitimate miners along with the macros
how about smarter belt pirates to cause grief to macro miners pirates which perferentially target largevaluable ships hulks use warp scramblers and engage drones would make life difficult for a macro i think since they target hulks they would let beginners play freely genuine human players should be able to respond to rats appropriately or if needed ask for help in local im not suggesting high dps rats rather low dps  warp scrambling capability
maybe we are going about this the wrong waywhen ccp looked at the rmt problem that is present on pretty much every mmo they implemented a novel solution a ccp certified way of meeting the same needs thus turning a problem into a profitable mechanicwhy not do the same thing with macros produce an api better yet a mini virtual machine and make them code in assembly limited cycles per real time clock that runs inside the client and allows scripts to operate make these scripts packagable items that can be traded on the market or at least contracts thus clever writer can make money selling designs to other playersplaying field gets leveled and they would create a whole new market type
i dont like seeing green moross blaster flashlites on my rifters plating even if i know it cant hit me with that thing
yes it would be quite nice is a miss really did look like a miss the comedy potential could be quite good if youve never played city of heroes misses especially with guns or energy blasts that were calculated as a miss did cause the animation to show a miss it really become hilarious when a player wielding a massive machine gun standing literally face to face with an npc has the server calculate a miss and you see him suddenly point his gun straight up and start shooting by the same token seeing a full broadside from a battleship trying to hit an orbiting frigate splay out in all directions would be damn funny to watch
now another little addition could we have tractor beams neuts vamps salvagers analysers and all those things come out of the places where they where mounted instead of guns the gun hardpoints at least for those ships that have empty gun hardpoints also would be nice if every ship had a hardpoint for all the effects like target painters to come out of that would make some sense looks ridiculous when my myrmidon target paints someone from its thrusters while flying away
give the syndicate faction more drug bps after all its space is supposed to be a pirate haven and its market flooded by contraband goods and illegal wares
as fleet salvager for corp missions i long for this feature
having been one of those pirates in the past and having as many as 5 discobs at a gate to lol at everything from a shuttle to hacs melting even before they can be targeted i would have to agree with the op somewhatyeah it was hilarious fun when a smacktard tried to warp through the camp from off angle only to see our repositioned fleet in his face but it got pretty boring after the first few thousand blue flashesdamage should not be applied until the ship is fully out of warp you cannot attempt to navigate or attempt to jump and thus should also not be damaged by aoe effectsjust the 002 from an old pirate
first im not for or against the dying in warp second u gotta realize that a smartbomb battleship with warp core stabilizers is one of the few counters a solo pilot can fly to stand a chance against a blob or just being outnumbered in general which im sure ull agree that its even more unbeatable and riskless
yes i preferred running on medium because it looked better if high looked similar to medium this wouldnt have really bothered me at all its hardly about the capability of my rigas it is a lot of color and detail was lost in environments that im accustomed to like in amarrgallente stations in other cases distant objects are rendered too sharply like npc structures in missions and plexeslow is just an awful colorless messwhat i really want to know is how less user setting options are considered better by anyone most games dont just have lowhigh but many variable options for all kinds of settings eve is very limited in that regard and taking away more options doesnt make any sense to me
actually im against this if caod goes away the idiots might start infesting the useful forumswell more than usual id rather just let them have their cesspool
this
oh megasigned the other forums on eveo are crap anyway
no one is forcing you to read caod you know lest have our fun there its like smack in local in my humble opinion if you dont like it dont read it i respect the posts and tone on this forum the unwritten rule on assembly hall is no smack an troll i never smack or troll or flame on this forum even thou some of the proposals is just an open invitation i think its only fair we have caod where some of us can behave like children me included i may be childish on caod from time to time but i find it funny in my book there are two options either dont read caod or to quote gandhi be the change you want to see in this world now back to caod to act like a child
so whats your proposal pictures of drill sergeants and 150point red font
thank you for the thumbs up 
this is so exploitable it isnt even funny

ccp needs to give the csm secretary mod powers over the csm forums that would solve all this stuff cleanly sadly either the forum software doesnt support that theyre not willing to or both hopefully its the former and spacebook will fix that until then though its not going to happen still supporting it  it really ought to be fixed
yesmarking threads with proposals picked up by the csm is also part of the package of improvements to the assembly hall forum tools
are you mad the csm4 secretary is a total noob the current system is pants there isnt anything to suggest that a topic you are raising is there already let alone been voted on even adding subcategories would help however we are stuck with this for the momenti do think it would improve matters if it was possible to actively lock threads once they have been raised or gone inactive to stop thread necromancy this could apply to duplicates too lock with a link to the master topicsadly this would take a significant amount of effort to keep on top of so i cant see this working without more ccp involvementi do support this idea of a quick indication that a topic has been raisedpassedrejected though
what is it with the obsession to avoid necros does a good idea get bad just because no one posted in the thread for a month if you start locking them for that people will have yet another reason to bump threads and when that fails they will create a new duplicate thread which will have to start from scratch getting support the same things will be discussed etc so imo nothing is gained
after that mazilliu person you think thats a good idea no way should a csm have mod powers as someone who just recently necrod a bunch of ideas i thought were good i disagree theyre inactive 90 days after the last post not before a good idea is a good idea no matter how long ago it was raised
if it was a good idea why wasnt it being supported also who said a monththis forum isnt a suggestions and ideas forum it is a place for people to post a proposal gather support for it either gain 25 of the last voter turnout or getting a csm representative on side and have it put to csm if stuff hasnt been picked up and hasnt had a comment for say 6 months lets draw a line under it and move onpeople do that anyway if people are campaigning for support on a proposal as they should be and via other channels not just here then bumping is naturally done by people supporting or disputing the idea bumping only becomes a problem when the bumps become the proposer clinging on to a failed idea in the hope that they will eventually gather a few more supportersbut considering csm dont have mod powers this is a moot point because maz is the template for all csm reps i saw this and also noted that you deliberately bypassed the 5 min forum timer in the process and pushed all the active threads off the front page well done note that most if not all of those necrod threads have had no further support since your bump which basically shows why they ended up inactive in the first place also a quick look shows the majority of those threads have less than 2030 supports even though they have been around for over 90 days whilst a couple threads had around 6080 supportsim not saying the ideas are bad but if there isnt any support perhaps the proposal needs reworkinganyway we are getting off topic some indication that a thread has been taken to a csm meeting is a good idea
supported it would be good to know when csm has looked at a topic and discussed it you might have two colors one for csm has looked at it and one for csm has made a decision on it since there might still be some debate and suggestions after csm has taken an initial look
it was but it got bumped off the front page and then forgottenand if it was forgotten for a good reason no need to lock it rightyou among all people should know that csm can only handle a limited amount of issues thus lots of proposals with excellent support are not brought up because there was something more pressinginteresting at the timereally other than fi what other channels do we haveyes and at some point the discussion ceases because everything has been said and all interested assembly hall regulars have voted if you click through the pages youll see countless proposals with incredible high support which never got raisedyes but with better forum tools this could be handled as well like auto locking based on novotes or even better a system that makes bumping unnecessary
probably not it was just a suggestion because i like things to be neat and tidy if it is a really pressing issue for somebody i wouldnt expect them to leave it for 3 months without a bump or an attempt to get a csm rep to pick it upmany people dont use the eveo forums but have in game channels evebloggers industry siradio etc which they use to point people at relevant proposals about their common interests not to mention other eve related forums corp  alliance forums etc it depends on the idea of course but there are other ways to get support and each support is a bump as wellbut if people are behind the proposal they should be approaching the csm reps most closely related to that area of gameplay and pointing at the level of support achieved it is a safe bet it will be missed if it has dropped below say page 5 and a quick eve mail with a link to it wont hurt if you get no reply within a week or so you can post that on the thread for a bump and a kick up the backside of the csm reps i agree totally we are limited by the current system hence my support of your other thread i dont speak for the whole csm except when publishing minutes etc  but i figured when i had time i would enter some of these discussions i know not everyone will agree with me which is fine the rest of the csm dont agree with me all the time either
no but if it happens once it can happen again ccp already demonstrated their lack of concern for the integrity of the csm give the wrong csm member mod powers and we might as well all forget this forum for 6 months
minor but sensible that said i want that view available contracts feature everywhere not just on scans
missile retargetingsince we cant seem to get faster missiles without breaking the game what if guided missiles lightheavycruisecitadel cruise were able to retarget when a ship has been destroyed or warps awaysay you are shooting at fred in an apocalypse from 220km away fred sees a ton of missiles coming and warps away or is destroyed by turret fire all the missiles heading towards fred will be diverted to ralph who you also have targeted and flagged as a secondary targetguided warp missilessecond solution which imo would work nice for ships without a missile velocity bonus what if guided missiles could warpexample jim raynor in his raven fires his cruise launchers they fly out 20km and after 20km they warp towards the target and strike there would still be a short flight time delay however cruise missiles would swiftly strike ships from a long distancethe only drawback to this is that cruise missiles generally do superior dps to turret ships setup to shoot that far so maybe we should introduce special warp enabled guided missiles they would still have their base range limitations that are currently implemented would only be a factor for lightheavy really but i dont think frigates should be shooting lights 250km away but could strike from long distance of course having an onboard warp engine would mean a smaller warhead and less damage output but if a raven or typhoon for example with guided warp missiles could do 300dps from 220km that would be kinda nice and mean people can bring missile ships to fleets
2nd proposal what kind of use would missile range skills have theni think the normal warp mechanics should apply here meaning missiles should only warp if the target is 150km awayall in all i think missiles are fine ravens are good at killing support
would still be quite useful for rocketsheavy assaulttorpedocitadel torpedo and would also still increase the maximum range of all missiles 150km makes sense though yes i would still give the missile an arming time i dont think they should warp straight out of the chute yanno what i mean
the retargeting aspect would only be the feasible solution but only if it requires skills and an additional high slot and or mid slot module other than the launchersuch a thing would be a bit overkill and would threaten balance if some sort of penalty wasnt in placewhen i used missiles heavily ive always frowned when i wasted a salvo of torps or missiles when the target was destroyed or off gridif you where getting aggrod the missiles should retarget what happens if you getting repped well thats aggro under the mechanics to a degreeso you got a few things to work outall in all this could be a can of worms
flag secondary targets with overview
could work 
what if missiles were shot out from the launchers like normal turretsbut they wont reach the target only appear like 50km before the target then the missiles would travel from there to hit the target the same way as they do it now ofcourse the flight time would get a decrease according to target distanceso it wouldnt matter if the target is 50km away or 200km away  the missiles would have the same delay timethe retargeting system seems too complicated and imho bad for lag
this is a great ideaall the really lame ass ideas will forever be at the top of the forumas a constant flow of peops show there non supportif you dont support an issueproposal there no need to post at allyou are not supporting a topic by erm not ticking support or even postingnot supportted  just in case you dont get it by my lack of not supporting this propal by not providing my support
iam for the love of god crop that picture so it doesnt break my browser or better yet stick it on eve files
a direction crosshair in space was the way frontierfirst enc did it and that worked very welli love the new look of powersliding my bs  but somesort of clearing indication of ship travel would be useful using the dusts travels direction is a bit squint inducing
i have been thinking about this for a long time and while i know i havent worked out the kinks in this here is my proposalimprove researching tech i blueprints with the following following the give  take principles and adding a new skill called ship customization or something similar giving 1 adjustment per level max 4using the abaddon as my baseamarr battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to large energy turret damage per level  5 armor resistance per level so say i want to make an abbadon with better resistances i would following the gt principles adjust the bonuses accordingly using the skill at level 3 you would get the following 2 bonus to large energy turret damage per level  8 armor resistance per level or 8 bonus to large energy turret damage per level  2 armor resistance per level now to take this even a step further i would also suggest at say level 5 of the skill the researcherinventor could remove one of the following skills and replace it with an appropriate racial bonus for the bonus that is removed so you dont get 5 armor resistances  say 5 armor or armor repair  repair timethis also gives to specialized ship builders something to leave their mark on maybe modified by or built by  corpalliance  giving sellers  owners a chance to make a name for themselves as  corp specializes in building this the of ship visually identical unless you scan the ship with a ship scanner most people would not know if your ship is built to be a glass cannon or a tanker from hadesas to the technical aspect of this i would treat is the same as tech ii but would require more research time for this modification as well as depending on the modification the use of different research materials including possibly a bpc of a ship using one of the bonuses wanted for said changing of bonusesmy two cents while a rough draft this to me is something to think overedit changed proposal to idea as it really is more of an idea
its interesting but how would the market work it would need to have 100s of entries for each ship for each possible configuration it doesnt sound plausible
the market would work just like it does with bpos and bpcs there isnt a seperate entry for every combonation of me and pe is there
well thats because you cant put researched bpos or bpcs on the market so that only furthers my point
i would like to fully customize the t1 platforms say you start with an unbonused platform where you can adjust powergrid cpu slots dronebay bandwidth turret points targeting range etc etc and bonuses each races ships would have to stay within the race specific bonuses though no laser and ecm bonus on gallente ships i believe it will never happen though becouse of the autobalancing problem i can see how the dominix upgraded to tier 3 battleship with rr range bonus instead of hybrid bonus might be a problem
as for the market it would need some major adjustments again still not 100 i have been tossing this idea around in my head this is more of a write it down and get input type proposal i was speaking with my corp leader and we went into a tangent on how the whole market system would need to be adjusted around thisto me its as simple as contracting bpcs which would include the information of what bonuses the bpc had  yes read your contracts to the fullest  i personally have issues with the contract system but thats something for another day
so just to make it clear none of the bpc or final product created from those bpcs ie the ships would be sold on the marketim going to have to say no again nothing wrong with your idea but breaking the entire market around this idea is bad the potential benefits do not outweigh the downside not by a long shot
as it stands no it would be contract only as some ships could be 4 to 6 or 2 to 8 on their bonuses it would make it hell on the current market systemif you have a solution to this i would be willing to hear it
this cannot possibly be balanced nor can it possibly be workable no thank you
i think its a really cool idea pimp my boat yeah i like it ferrari corporation
not supported
more options to customize ships would always be nice but its hard to make it balanced as it is some ships are almost overpowered while others are practically useless the market problems aside i could only support it if some kind of handicap were included with the modification for example sacrifice a rig slot if you want to adjust the ship bonuses of course then the natural course would be to forget the invention stuff altogether and just make new two rigs where one increases the bonus 1 and decreases the bonus 2 and the other works vice versa make it also unusable in t2t3 shipsnot supported for now as i cant see it happening in the foreseeable future
im against this a bit less annoyance is not worth the possibility of putting someone into an irreparable game state
right but the simplest solution would be to remove the automatic sawning of rookie ships and add a button request 1 rookie ship in this stationthis way the player could spawn a rookie ship everywere he want even where he already has a ship available or in a hostile station but the system will not automatically generate tons of rookie ships add a small cooldown period to avoid people that would spawn tons of them for fun
be in the same corp you dont have to pay concord or bring one unit of trit along to the fight anyway whats wrong with one unit of trit you both steal from each others cans and you can both kill each other you dont even waste the mill
they have these already theyre called jetcans also wardecs
id be fine with allowing saved probe configs as a way of letting players do this sort of thing for themselves but the game trying to tell me what i want to do with my probes seems like a recipe for frustration
this but because i want this post noted supported
i remember a video interview with one of the devs who stated this is a result they are working to achieveit was in one of the fanfest vids so either they are still working on it or it may not be possible at the moment and was placed on holdso just keep reminding em 
not sure whether id call this making probing more fiddly or just plain easier probing does not need to be made an easieri cant support this unless you add in the op that there wouldd be an option to turn this offcause sometimes i like my probes right where they are and i dont want them moving around all by themselves
oh come on what would you know about npc corp jita trade alts more seriously it wont screw anyone the vast majority of trade is solo and that wont change this will just make corp trading less silly

every new patch the same thing im starting eve client waitin for login screen waiting for declaration of incompatibility waiting for patch notification pressing ok waiting omg for downloading auto loader waiting for closing login screen what and so ontherefore i cant autopatch eve on a distant machines via remote desktop or radmin because i cant launch login screen but i do not need to login i just need to patch so i have to waste my time to patch every computer manualy using afterloginscreenautopatcher it make no sence imhofor sure i can download patch manually using mexe links but its really uncomfortable and what autopatcher is anywaymaybe its not a very important problem but for me it isplease make patching before login screen not after help me csm4 you are my only hope 
so basically you want them to change the autopatcher to better suit you even though you are the exception to the established patch process rather than the rule and you already admit theres a way for you to do what you want to do without them doing any work at allumno if you want to be different thats fine but dont expect ccp to change things just to suit your differences
uve forgot to support this topic mate 
can you explain exactly why you need to patch so much machinesinternet cafe with eve online or thatupdsupport this feauturelooks like sometimes it can be good thing
my speed internet connection  128 kbpsbecause its not possible to use download managers in resume mode i have to pay traffic for every update
what are you getting at againbecause i fail to see the problemmy complaint is the patcher tends to be ed have to slap upside the head every so often when it tries to get you to reinstall the clientother than that it works fine
no no no i play at home 3 machines at work 3 offices  4 machines at my gf comp my workpersonal notebooks depends were im atand i cant just press buttom patch distantly and forget about it i have to download patch manually it means that autopatcher is not auto
what are you doing playing remotely all the time oo
autppatch much plz
i do not play remotely i play where im at i just want to spend my free time on playing and not installing patches if i could install patches remotely  i would spend 10 minits for all machines but i cant and i spend few hours if patch is not very bigi mean for what are we launching login screen when we cant login because of incompatibility it makes no seeeense or it is
eve addict muchsheesh so let me get this straight your throwing a fit over the time it takes to patchwhat is this a trollyeah not supported
what cmon guys do u realy like startingclosing client every patch for no reason just to see incompatibility do u like no direct links to patches and no resume in autopatcher downloadsi dont care about traffic but someone careswhat i care is my free time thats alli think its more comfortable to patch first and to login afteror maybe it would be better to login first and patch after lol
couldnt you just use the repair tool
allow me to clear up your confusionyour using a client a client that has no idea whats going on until it launches and checks in with big mama which is the serveryou log in client says hi supserver says hey cant let you in you need a patchyou download patch client shuts down patches you restart client rinse and repeat and heywhat do yah know your inwhat your asking for is for a clinet that is always active and on hidden in the background for what a measly 10 minutes of frustration on your partdude you got issuestime for you to take a walk in the park and remind yourself there is more to life then a measly missed 10 minutes of eve onlineamiright k have a great dayps we dont have a problem with it because we can find things to do while we wait for it to patchhowever if we have to reinstall the game thats not fun but there is no issue works as intendedand this doesnt belong here should go to issuesworkarounds  o p

i support this idea and wish to subscribe to your newsletterexcept i cant watch a thread which is another missing feature this forum should have and only this forum or spammage will ensuebetter tools to enable people to find and support existing threads instead of the same issue being raised in 15 slightly differently named threads would be a good start however i would go as far as to suggest that the csm should have a subsite rather than simply a couple of forum sections something with a more formalised proposal raising system gameplay categories problem solution pros cons etc as specific sections so things are all in the same format it would also create and attach a discussion thread for public comment as well as support not support and dont care options the system should allow the proposer and current csm reps to make edits to the proposal which like the wiki are logged so you can see who changed whatit would be almost a wiki with discussion thread but slightly more formal in structure you cant rely on people putting things in the correct format they cant manage that now it would have to be enforced by the systembetter tools i dont mean csm reps even if you think we are tools  would mean better proposals going forward and thus the csm will be better used

everything has been sayd
this issue was raised to ccp by the first csm after really strong urging from jade constantine the consensus then seemed to be that actual outright destruction was badif only because it would wreck players asset lists in rather unpleasant fashion but a mechanic whereby they can be sacked and left in a damaged stateunusable but repairable if someone wants to spend several billion was generally fairly wellreceived this would also work well with the new outpost mechanics  make it so that you have to sit through 2 rf timers to take a station but only one to wreck it the idea isnt bad but no support because its already been raised
1 find alliance with most dreadstitanscaps2 blow all hostile 00 stations up3 4 profit
perhaps not destroyable but absolutely wreckable to the extent of not allowing docking and access to hangars you can still undock in your current ship but the station needs repairsrebuilding at some cost to recover other assets
that route seems the most reasonable but is there a reason to just have 2 states recovering existing assets shouldnt be much of a hasle compared having to repair the station in full working orderi would suggest at least 3 different status levels first is fully functional with all the services working second is destroyed with only the ability to get out stuff already in there maybe you can still get in with a pod and leave with small shipsshuttles but cant bring any new shipssupplies third stage where you could dock normally and use it as a base but services wouldnt be working more could be added as people see fit but you need few different station graphicsmodels to represent the damage and reconstruction anyway so you might as well have corresponding status levels to the outposts to give more options

thank you cms for ignoring us players twicegood job
it is csm not cms this topic only has 24 supporters and was submitted too late for the meeting on the 17th it didnt have 7 full days before the meeting we only had limited time for issues on the 24th and thus this wasnt looked atif you want this brought up ahead of better supported proposals i suggest you seek out one of the mission focussed csm reps and get them to take it forwardalternatively get 25 of the voter turnout from the csm4 election to support the issue which will force it to be included on the agenda
there were 20k votes cast in the csm 4 election has any assembly hall thread ever had anything even vaguely close to 5k supports looking over the first few pages even widely supported threads like boost afs and the original dead horse pos only have a few hundred supports 5k supports is also considerably greater than the number of votes received by any one member of the current csm dont you think this number should be revised downwards
im simply quoting from the csm devblog imo even 400500 supports would be beyond most proposalsthis may well be a topic for discussion with ccp in the meantime the only practical way to have a proposal raised is by talking to a csm rep who campaigned along similar issuesgameplay the other point here is that if you cant get even a single csm rep to support an idea what do you think the chances are of it being passed at a meeting is this fact part of why so few people support proposals
seems helens a bit butthurt about dronesboat violenced by em a few timesedit there was nothing wrong with my proposal the maffs are entirely up to ccp as has been stated i gave plenty of options and suggestions and reasoning lets not forget reasoning behind it someone just obviously did not read the proposalstop being racist against drones 1 theres no drone implants in game none zip zero zilch nada goose egg the big fat null 2 if they are meant as a secondary damage system then why are there drone boats what about the myrmidon pilgrim curse ishtar and gila unlike the vexor and domi those boats only get dps bonuses to drones3 large rigs only working on large drones wtf does this even mean teadaze do large weapon damage rigs only give bonuses to large guns no they give that bonus to all guns of that weapon type so yes a large drone damage rig will give its damage bonus to every combat droneyou want a specific proposal here it isdear ccp claus there are no drone implants in game the drone users of eve would like somealso while youre at it a drone damage rig would be nice
i will quote whole proposal as raised in response where is the specific reasoning behind drone rigs and implants beyond because other weapon systems have themif this was not your original proposal then i suggest you contact the csm rep who raised it and ask them why they didnt include any detailsso working from this proposal there are no options and not a single suggestion for types stats etc saying that it is up to ccp to design everything is pure laziness certainly they will tweak what is proposed if it is passed but they shouldnt have to do all the initial research on a csm proposal it should have included examples in the first place mostly to support why they are neededthe irony is i like the idea of drone implants as i stated providing they are sized as per weapon implantssized rigs are new which is why we currently have a small sentry drone augmenter which is a bit daft when only one ship iirc can even use it and why would you fit one sentry in a frig over 5 t2 lightsso yes the current system is that any size of rig gives the bonus to any size of gunlauncher etc however the only drone damage rig is specifically locked to sentry drone damage have you considered why ccp decided that only sentries should have a damage rig it was never addressed in the proposal but it must have reasoning behind it nonow if we look at ship bonuses all ships with weapon bonuses have it apply only to a single size of gunlauncher except some missile boats where light and heavy missiles are bonused and all drone boats where it applies to all sizes of drone the domi for example is the only battleship that gets a bonus to light weapons when using light drones of course if there was a general drone damage rig then the domi would be the only battleship with a double bonus to light weapons even having single bonused light drones off a rigged battleship is a nerf to frigate pilots with no drawback to the battleship well it would take up the rig slots but that is alli simply wondered if drone rigs should be sized which wasnt possible originally with the one size fits all rig so that the bonuses apply to the size of drone appropriate to the ship it was a topic for conversation and something not addressed in the proposali am not against the idea of more drone rigs even though there are already 16 drone rigs in gamethat was even less specific than the proposal we voted on
okay lets try this again number 3please examine the following game grind issues and put them forward for changesorting corporate deliveries as personal assets can be sorted by rangeallow us to get rid of the market overunder percentage warning popup if we can get rid of the criminal action popup why must we suffer this thing with no recourse in the end as has been mentioned in about 4 separate threads on the assembly forum enable the option to keep or discard all of the various popups per user preferancescience and industry ui improvements in line with the market so industrialists can see how many job slots they have openin usepos fabrication arrays reactors refineries ect showing up on the industry ui would also be a boon to production managers this has not been brought up in the assembly hall but can fall under ambers ui suggestionswhy do i get the feeling im merely beating my head on a wall here anyway
im pretty sure thatd be too late to get on the iceland agenda
only 14 supports one from a csm rep  i suggest you contact them directly to get this moved forwardonly 5 supports  have you tried speaking to the industrial focussed reps about this why are there 4 threads about it anyway are people not willing to support somebody elses thread on the same issue7 supports one from an alternate csm rep  again have you tried speaking to the industrial focussed reps about thisi know the feeling well i put together a sticky post about how to get a proposal raised and picked up thus i suggest you speak to one or more of the industrialist csm reps and get them to pick up these issues because i dont think youre going to get these picked up on supports alone 25 of the last voter turnout required
i am linking a thread and proposal i made about changing the autobalancer for the mission payout so that they would be more fair for low sec00 if you think it is a acceptable proposal support it i havent placed it in this thread as i think that placing it here would mean losing that suggestion under several other proposalslow sec missions and the autobalancer

i dont understand the reluctance on the part of csm having shield ships get zero ehp from gang bonuses is a problem illustrated by the low amount of shield ships used in fleets compared to armor ships the disparity is vastly increased whith shield tanked cap shipsive read the csm logs and theres not a lot of explanation of why they think its fine as is i would like to see a post from a few other csm members explaining their position on this more clearly
all the dont leave the pc out comments are pretty silly every shooter in existence that can be played on both pc and console keeps those 2 realms separate not only is it hard impossible to integrate sony ps3 with pc etc but itd also be unfair fps on pc offers superior control and response time due to the way the mouse works this isnt anticonsole bias i now prefer to play on a console but it simply is dust cannot keep them separate as there is only one eve universe pc based groups would have an unfair advantage over console based groupswould it work if eve had 100 servers ala wow sure but it isnt so it wont im pretty amazed there are this many people who are posting when this is so obviously never going to happen
sums up this whole thread tbh
i think they should make it pc only then seeing as the community that made ccp who they are eve online are in fact pc only
ahh but then how would they tap the console gamers marketwhat a fascinating and utterly baseless assumption
ccp dust 514 for pcsigned
signedim not going to debate or rage oni have no interest in getting in a console warsmy opinion is clear and beyond debate with me
first try googling ccp whats the first thing that comes up oh and did eve not win some award recently what was that for again
community college of philadelphia then ccp games then eve online your pointit was for best community and best game of 2009 how does this support your claim that players of eve are exclusively pcgamers
no no no i missworded my comment i am saying that eve is pc only not that people who play eve are pc only
oh ok then lol that makes a lot more sense then now hehe
ooh what the hellill just jump in i am stupid after allhere is the thing arguing over what is better pc or console will always have flaws in the argumentnether is betteryes pc  easier hackfact consoles can be hacked but not as easyheres the thing i dont think it should be pc or console exclusiveether of those would be an insult to gamers of all platformspc fans tend to try and talk things out in a long big worded manner this makes us sound like pricksconsole fans storm petitions like this and fill it with insults and raw emotioni think we need to both get are heads out of are asses and start 2 petitionsone for yes one for nothis will draw the battle line clear and make the votes easy to count and the winner will be declaredif we must fight then lets fight so as they will listen to us instead of ignoring everyone because we make these petition posts erratic and filled with more ing then real commentsi personally believe in equality for all platformsbut that looks more and more like a pipe dreamif you companys have not stopped reading this by now listen to me console and pc fans do not mix you most find a bridge that both sides dont want to set of firewell s to me i make my opinion clear as a bellmay the flaming on my post begindont expect me to care i cant change your minds

supportededit i hardly think it will take a lot of time to alter one tiny policy
yes developing the keybinding system would do it but it might not be a great deal of code to do the next step and implement the voicecommad link but maybe we should not speculate to far how much work it is for ccp because the only guys who really know how much work it is are the cpp developers so why not giving them the idea and then they can decide what they do about it and how much work they can put into it
while this is an extraordinarily cool idea  there are several far more pressing issues that the developers need to be focused on adding a oh wow neato feature needs to be prioritized appropriatelylove the idea cant support the implementation of it at this time
to whom it may concernwhat you are saying is that the current mechanics of salvaging is not correct to real world examples therefore what you are saying is that there is no example of a conflict engagement a mission occurring consisting of winner of the conflict engagement the player and a loser of the conflict  engagement the npc and subsequently a third party the ninja turning up later and salvaging the wrecks for profit without permission from either the designated player or npc of the conflictengagementare you sure of this factbrechan skene
thats a hell of a long post to make just because you didnt get your own waythe csms purpose isnt to give one segment of the player base everything they want ccp have made their position on salvage rights very clear and as far as theyre concerned threads like this are predicated on a false assumption that salvage ever belonged to the person who created the wreckit has been definitely proven that this is neither the case in real life nor was it ever the case in the gamethe issue here is not the csm failing but a widespread misconception amongst a segment of the playerbaseyou have completely failed to make the case that you are entitled to the salvage from wrecks you create you can if you like try and make a case that you should be entitled to it but that would involve demonstrating that high sec missioners dont make enough isk already face too much competition from other hisec professions and dont have a diverse enough set of income sources from the isk minerals loot lp faction gain and such salvage as you already getgood luck with that
warm blood oni find the whole discussion of what ownership ccp intended absurd it simply is not relevant to the discussion of how it should be really there is no end to the amount of low iq backbone reaction people in this game and its not just in this thread its almost every subject ever taken up im sick of itps please note i did not say how i feel about the subject so dont cry about that just had to get a load off cold blood back on
given that it is ccp that makes the final decisions on the mechanics of the game i find that their intentions especially when they have very clearly laid them out time and time again are very relevant
sighill answer you and then never come back to this thread ill blow a bloodwessel omg UFFFDUFFFDits not relevant to the discussion of whether a change is in order how can anything ever change if idiots rule the day with working as intended arguments how some people can equate intented with best is beyond me btw i personally dont care if they change it or not its fun to shoot the wrecks just under the nose of ninjas they always scream its so funny
in this case ccp has made it clear time and again how they want salvaging to function theyre not idiots and their argument isnt simply working as intended there are six or seven posts that have been copied and pasted into this thread and just about all the others on ninja salvaging that explain their views on itin more detail than your own arguments
now it only remains for someone to claim that salvage flagging will protect new players
salvage flagging will protect new pl nah i cant complete that with a straight facemuch of what i could contribute has already been said so ill simply agree that the current system is fine and if people are so annoyed about missing out on the isk from minor salvage they should pick a more profitable profession
or a different place to mission its not that hard to find one ive been missioning for the last four months or so running level fours to grind standing for rd agents  ive been ninja salvaged i think twice in that time honestly when you get right down to it the impact on my income was so small i doubt i noticed it
thats a battle thats been fought for years  best of luck on that not saying youre wrong  but im pretty sure that if it was an easy fix it would have been taken care of by now
well youve gotta fix it some day
hmmm i agree with this and i wish theyd stop being botherd about the game as its finea t the moment and focus on graphics thats why most people play wow isntead jsut for the graphics i do like idea of missiles being upgraded graphics wise though and they shoudl at elast get the guns and missiles sorted before the ewar stuff first only thing i think this game lacks is a little bit of annimationthey should work on anniamtion and graphics of weapons then ewar then ure idea on how things miss that in annimation could lead to things missing and hitting other ships but thats for further down the lineall in all sort annimation and we have agreat game  more sub so htye get mroe money
yes better graphics and more options perhaps any missing shots could be displayed on a vector from the gun to where the ship was 2 seconds or so before the actual shot was fired that doesnt sound like it would be hard to do or intensivemissing shot animation displayed on xyz vector 20  or somethingi personally think eve is in dire need of graphic options enabledisable options for effects abcdetcvery good post

of course i realize it and agree with you but its not the point herethis thread is about disco bs with an alt on the other side of the gate they will never die its riskless
the man has a point about smartbombs dealing damage before any other weapon systems can but its aoe for a reason
i think if smart bombs are allowed in low sec i should be able to drop bombs on the gang camping the gate basically smart or regular bombs either need to be allowed or both need to not be allowed in low sec
or have a garage alt which neatly gets around the whole issuewhich is why they all have garage alts or similar arrangements to entirely avoid all that risk neat huhno i would point out that this is the status quo most 10 characters have shopping alts mission alts etc they dont even need to be on a separate accountwhats making me laugh is that you are actually proposing this as an argument do you even play evestrange  i know all manner of people in various militias who are kos in various areas of space who use market alts etc to entirely get around this limitationim laughing again  but only at your argumentno they do not they only have those drawbacks if you have an allergy to having other characters you dont even need other accounts in most cases to do those things for you assets ships etc are easily transferred between such characters even if on the same account through the contract systemthe limitations you describe simply do not exist they exist for a single character but any player can get around them so absurdly easily simply by having a different character do them  even on the same account so it wont even cost him or her more moneyyoure on the csm and you do not know the most common way eve is playedactually if you think about it it increases risk at least for those who use itcurrently reality is that when supercarriers and titans are not needed a character enters them and logs out they vanish into the great beyond where they are entirely and completely invulnerable until needed their pilots then go do other things until those ships are needed againthis isnt a security buff quite the contrary it puts the vessel more at risk because it is in game to be attackedyour argument is so nonsensical that i can only assume that you must fear that were security to be a bit more sensible ccp would put in a rule that you couldnt log out in a supercap which really would greatly reduce their security so either thats your real reason for trying to torpedo a most reasonable request or you honestly dont understand the way the game is commonly played at all
they clearly have their agendanote the silly point about somehow my not replicating the original post rather than a more sensible link somehow invalidates the proposali could cut and paste it in five seconds and waste more of my time but im thinking well have to wait for either a more reasonable csm member to come along or just a more reasonable csmby the way  nice job chasing that tri fleet through our system the other day its always great to see you guys out  shame we couldnt have caught them between us  but then theyd have just logged out
hahaha oh wowby the same token most supercap pilots have garage alts and they dont even need to be on a seperate account eitherit is possible to live as a 10 without any alts at all just as it is possible to live in a supercap without any alts at allin fact all of your counter arguements revolve around but these people can use alts to get around their limitations so why the hell cant you
o7ill be sure to pass your compliment up to the guys in chargeside steps anvilmeep meep
it is also possible to leap out of an aircraft at over 30000 feet without a chute and survive the fall in fact there was a tail gunner from a b17 who did so in 1943however not many people are willing to try it possible doesnt mean its a good idea or commonly done it just means not impossiblei can easily even reasonably cheaply that doesnt mean its right however as ive mentioned several times i think alts are the thing that damages eve the most my wife disagrees and has two accounts so she can dual box and mine and haul at the same time  its not for me to force her to adhere to my ethics even though i pay for all three of our familys accounts its not a matter of money or of time its a matter of ethicsi happen to think that its wrong therefore i am not in favor of doing itperhaps i shouldnt really expect someone who cannot adhere to a real world legal agreement over an unfair advantage in a video game to understand ethics however
that depends on your definition of an altan alt typically is one of 3 slots on a single account in addition to the main that is created to do various things like a cyno alti dont consider it to be an alt if its an actual paid for accountbut then thats where the debate startsbottom line if your paying for that additional char i dont got a problem with itwhich is why i favor killing off all alts and forcing people to get multiple subscriptionsbut then no one would like that would solve alot of problems and make the game interesting thomy corporation however would kill me 
ok then its possible to own and use a supercarrier without a parking alt just because you are not willing to try it does not mean that the game should be altered to suit your needs and particular ethical bentoh snapplease dont lecture me on ethics sunshine ill eat you for breakfast
lol no wonder why csm is at the state as it is now like these 2 elitist csm delegates telling us that we dont realy want a supercap if we dont want to stuck an alt in one like forevermothership use is so limited they are just a buffed carriers with ew immunity and bombers  extra hpthey cost a lot and cant be insured why docking one could be exploited but anchoring one should be fine1 for one would like to buy a mothership for my alt but because i wont be able to use that char for anything else forces me to not to do it
definitely needs to happen 100 omniscient intel in a system with no effort at all really sucks 
while annoying when trying to find prey there needs to be balanceall advantage can not be in the attacker since that would mean that no one at all would be in systems apart from jumping between places to fuel stuff making especially 00 almost completely devoid of any lifethere needs to be at least a fair chance of someone getting away rather than being a free kill
supported local is ridiculous out of hisecso maybe lowsec could have the number of pilots but no names unless they talk 00 could have totally nothing unless they talk but possibly have inteligence sov structures to gather said intelanyway local currently sucks and creates a perfect intel device for free and with no skill to use change needed
your idea would make lag far worse than retargetingyour asking for missiles to spawn offgrid and ongrid at a supposed random location and then to seek a target and hit said target provided the target is there to begin with a target likely movingmight want to think about that a bit 
no what would be the drawback of missiles then compared to gunscurrently they do decent dps and dont worry about tracking and most of the missiles dont worry about range eitheri would support this if say a bs sized cruise missile would have a speed of 300ms so a cruiser can outrun it just like it can outmanuver a bss gunsbut that way the change would be as much of a nerf as your proposal is an unneeded boostedit i wont eaven start about the warping missiles
i see you have never used missiles then missiles dont have to worry about tracking the stupidest thing i heared so far  missiles are more penalized by targets speed than guns same with range for delay dmgthey dont do decent dps if you add on their disadvantagesthats why nobody uses missiles at long rangedrake draconis why would my idea worse for lag missiles only spawn closer to target not at the missile ship 1 animation between them thats all the retarget thing would be the laggy one but that is an assumption as we dont know how the game is programed
nobody uses missiles because strategically they dont make sense cant hold a tackle at long range and guns do instant damage at range why would you want to leave your snipers at a perch for the entire time it takes a missile to travel 100km so that you can hit the target that may or may not be there anymoreto say that nobody uses missiles because of their low dps is a bit of a farce
i havent wrote that missiles have low dps  i wrote missiles dont have enought dps to even out their disadvantages at long rangeit doesnt matter if you have a weapon which has much better dps than the other weapon if it cant realistically apply that dmg like blaster is fleetsmissions
warping missiles sounds extremely awesome but it would be overpowered with existing missile stats p
on trying to think of a comment to make for this the only thing i could think of when i was about to hit post reply was all trollish ideas better have a serious oneso this is my actual trythe missile retargeting is seriously needed for pvp and pve during a mission is is so annoying to see 6 missiles just fly off into space when there are ships just next to it that i am already targeting that those 6 would really help in killing just as long as you dont make the ai like fof i dont want it randomly targeting my dronesi had another idea for the warping missiles but that to sounded trollish
fof missiles could warp not sure let missiles retarget to watever you paint with a traget painter only so whatever you yourself paint with a tp the missiles go to it if previous target vanishes
i will get the teleporting ability for my drones too
sorry to say this but both suggestion one and two are awful missiles have no tracking penalties like turrets the price you pay for this is that missiles some times dont hit target either because said target warps or gets destroyed im equally annoyed when my turrets fail to hit small fast moving targets thats the price i pay for instant damage yes i know that you can fit modules to make turret tracking better but by doing that you take up some mid or low slots witch could be used for other things
i think people have to accept that this can be considered one of the penalties for missile use as has been said sometimes turrets miss completely wasting ammo  should turret users be guaranteed a 100 hit rate as wellnot supported  missiles would become too overpowered
first try out missiles in fleet then come back to tell us how usefull you werei love when people posting about things they have no idea how they work at all
if youre caldari and want to take part in a long range bs fight then train for a rokh im sick of people wanting to homogenise all of the races weapons and nuances in this game guns are not missiles and missiles are not guns they both have their pros and cons
thug you where not quoting me i thing i will dignify that with an answeri personally fly minmatar caldare and galente if i ever brought a missile ship to at fleet fight i would ask me fleet mates to primary me just for bringing thatmissiles suck in large fleet pvp go to dotlan en se the kill mails after a large 00 battle i bet you most people fly amar and minmatar closely followed by galenteif you want to do better in fleets my advice would be to train for minmatar minmatar skips are extremely versatile and have a high dps or alpha if you have just a sleight of how to fitt them
everybody knows that fleet fights are for amarr  matar shipsthis is the problem the long range missiles caldari missile boats were designed for fleet fights in mindthats why the huge range they can operate at but because missile sux at long range these cant do their intended roles is there any reason to use a cerbnighthawkraven in fleetsnot realyso eighter they should change those to be good at closemedium range or fix missiles at long rangebecause other races were designed for the closemedium range  i would go with the fix missiles partoh and crosstraining is not a solution or an option
are you retiredmissile boats are particularly good at close ranges just because they get a range bonus doesnt mean they are long range only it also means they can utilise their close range weapon systems at longer ranges than their counterpartsand why is cross training not an option should all the races be able to do everything of course not please for the love of black jesus stop trying to dumb the game down
this and give me just one good reason why cross training is not an option
retired huh no and youmissile boats are particularly good at close range realy like the cerb is good with hams tackle gear cross trainging is bad for diversity and balance everybody knows thatshould all races be able to do everything hmm what about caldari should be able do its inteded tactic which is long range  oh and put matar back to their place by nerfing arties at least they should not be able to do everything according to youblack jesus it is so wrongdumb the game down so asking for balance is dumbing the game down why because then other races then mataramarr would be viablepls stop trolling
stop sperging out broyes a cerb is good with hams and tackle gear and is also an excellent hml platform for stand off support in small to medium sized gangs please tell me what other hac is capable of 500 dps at 40kmif you want to fly a caldari bs in a long range fleet fight then fly a rokh or a scorp you will have no problem applying instant dps or effectsprotip theres more to pvp than long range 00 slugfests and not everyone is inclined to use the traditional sniper fleets for those in fact since joining a 00 entity i havent once fitted long range guns on my bsi happen to fly all races and im perfectly happy with the performance of caldari and missile boats in generalplease learn to play then learn to spell and then stop trolling me
well this is disturbing to say the least after doing a search on evesearch for the whole issue of larkonisgate after reading this dev blog here just to get a better idea of what happened i found this thread and having a bit of time on my hands and a fresh cup of coffee i decided to go against my own judgement and read the forums for oncefirst of i like the idea of the csm its a whole new twist on the issue of game designer vs the player base and something that makes me proud of ccp being an icelander i have the same chronic sickness as the rest of the countrybut like dirty wizard says and then mazzilliu clearly confirms is that the csm is broken the csm is not broken because the large alliances have representatives in the council it is understandable that the largest bodies of players that have grouped themselves together vote for a player within their own alliance this mirrors what happens in real life you vote for the person that can best represent your views and ideas and as the council says at ca 35 minutes into the video here they are able to agree on issues concerning high low and zero sec play styles 90 vote on something concerning missions at 3918 min into the above videono the reason the csm is broken is that it allows a whole seat or more to be occupied by a player that clearly has no real drive to be in the csm mazzilliu she acts like a little kid in a school yard trying to act cool and tough against well written and thought out concerns about the issuesideas that the csm is spending their time talking about instead of acting like a representative of the players and taking her position seriously and with a little pridei have no ounce of fear regarding if ccp will allow the change mazzilliu suggested and the council voted on and passed by a margin of 1 vote mind you to get implemented because every individual can see the potential for misuse the csm is not a council that can impose its will on ccp this they have said many timesbut i guess that having the longest possible term only 1 year to weed out those who do not deserve to be there would only limit the use of those council members that actually do take their position with pride and realize what kind of unique position they are inand having a longer term 1 year would only create a larger possibility for individuals that think the csm is a joke to get elected repeatedly by those who share their narrow mindednessand how would ccp ever promote the idea of democracy to the players if they would simply kick out those csm members that are obviously not doing their job correctly even if the reasons were sound they would still be going against the principles that are the cornerstones of the csm this it would seem shows the flaw of democracy but i still endorse what ccp is doing with the csm and since this is the first time anything like this has been done before it is understandable that there will be some bumps along the way trying to get it right i only hope that ccp will create a better venue for the player base to both see each candidates list of ideasissues and to vote for the candidate they feel best represents them i can honestly say that i did not vote in the first two csms because of the difficulty to accurately find information on the candidatesedit time of 90 vote
just for the sake of argument and food for thought what if the csm wasnt a democratic system but a form of isocrazy a system where every individual has equal ruling power this would play itself out in theory as followsthrough a series of questions issues raised surveys etc available from inside the game every player can voice hisher opinion and the results go directly to ccps analists bypassing a councel this makes the whole councel absolete and the only data available to ccp would be scientific data the only people analyzing the data would be people with phds in statistics and whathaveyouany player can create a survey question and any player can answer survey questions the analists pass on the survey results to ccps game designers and they figure out how to turn that into game adjustmentsin that system theres very little room for corruption and the tyrany of the majority doesnt apply either because game designers have the final call not the majorityyour thoughts
sounds an awful lot like designbycommittee i dont know if youve ever been down that road but its not pretty
not really what i ment its not like majority rules in the end the game designers make all the game design desissions its just that the filtering system between the players and ccp is less corrupt this way
we need a csm thats accountable for there actionsno csm is worsecurrent csm system is an insult but its better than nothing
i think some accountability could improve the current system but how do you execute it
if i knew the answer to that question id come up with itfor starters these cannidates only get in with there massive alliance posses backing themnot all csms are elected this way but anyone in goonswarm pl or any other others are likely to win either wayso player participation is a big problem as a resultbut who keeps csm in check when they go about there businessdont know how to solve that problemand thats just the tip of the iceberg
i had a thought as i was buying nanite repair paste and thought i would put it in the assembly corner and hopefully might get some supportsimply put nanite repair paste blueprints on the marketplayers would then be able to produce it themselves and use it sell it in stations npcs dont seem to be seeding it ini go through a bit of repair paste now and again and its a pain having to pay the prices the npcs are asking when buying in bulk
it is a good idea but the prices are the hight they are for a reason ccp wants it to be more expensive to repair while your flying then if you dock and pay for it at a repair station i dont agree with it myself because i use the stuff a fair amount so i will happily sign this petition daco
its an intended isk sink just like station repairs in npc stations
i use missiles so the signature radius of targets is a huge part of a my tactical gameplay in both pve and pvphowever i currently have to guess the effect of mwd bloom target painters etc when choosing targets as the sig radius of a target cannot be shown in the overview which seems very odd for a core concept especially one which seems to require very limited work to implementproposal the overview should gain a new optional column showing the sig radius of the selected object
haha no that would not be opyesgimmeh
there is its called size funnily enoughderp
ive heard that only showed the base signature radius of the hull that youre looking at im not sure since ive never used it since there are more pressing things for me to have on my overview than sig radius
incorrect size is the base size of the hull it doesnt change and isnt the signature radius i was looking for in fact its not even useful a rough guide to the sig radius
serious question why would this be overpowered its showing me something clearly gameplay that i can infer anyway but in a clumsy fashion it doesnt directly boost damage or let me know its safe to engage cf ship scanners this isnt analogous to seeing eg cap levels or something else internal compare to seeing target velocity which also affects missile damage and might change what tactics i useat low skills levelsexperience playing its difficult to determine why some targets are effectively damaged and some arent this simply lets me know how much my tp is helping for example or if its even hitting turrets can see range  velocity missiles can only see one part of their damage equation inputsalternate id like the icons on the tactical overlay to be tactical with sized circlesspheres according to sig radius
i apologise then they must have changed it recently
or i might be wrong anyone know for sure the size is invariant even on missions where velocity  target dmg suggest mwd bloom which is why im assuming its a base size and my pvp is too chaotic to say one way or another from thatnote to self experiment with corp mate soon to test this
topic is fairly self explanatory ive seen a few of these threads pop up but usually centered around being able to inject skills before you meet the prereqswhat im saying is to be able to put a skillbook you have into your training queue without injecting the skill itself obviously youll need the prereqs in the queue already and when the queue comes across the new skill it will auto inject it and continue training saves you from the hassle of having to get up in the middle of the night to inject and train your next skill
in before the trolls start threatening to change queue back to the way it wasyour variation of the proposal was suggested as well so supported
dont be such a perfectionistput capital ships skill on 5 at the end of the queue and inject the new one when you get online next timeyour post is the same as everyone elses injecting before prereqs are metand has a lot of problems like where is the actual skillbok at a given time what if you remove a prereq from the middle of the queue etcactualy what if you do anything in relation to the location of the skillbok or anything in relation to the prereqs wich are not trainedalso support because i would like someone else to figure out and solve all the problems so i can inject skills without prereqs and add them to queue
when the queue reaches the desired autoinjection time it will check for the skillbook in your hangar so all u have to do is stay docked with the appropriate skillbooks to inject if its not there it wont inject and the queue will pause and if u screw with the queue in any way it will not autoinject if your new queue list does not allow it to just like trying to remove lvl 4 x skill before lvl 5 x skill simple as that
and if i live in 00 and im not docked in a station
could be simplified further to only check the ships hold or check both ship hold and station hangeri like this proposal though its unneeded but it the ocd kids absolutely have to have it its better then the inject any book wo prereq proposals we usually getim meeting you halfway you dirty hippies
while i would like this feature i would prefer ccp spent their time in other areas not supported
way to blow away the efforts of skill queue improvementsnot supporting removing the human factorallow injection within queue time yesauto injection at end of the queue hell no
this is 100 what i had in mindas for living in 00 and not being docked well then either take it from the ships cargo as others suggested or just have it not work since i dont think you can inject skills from cargo not really sure though i dont tend to try and inject skills from my ships cargoeither way the whole idea of the skill queue was to prevent the need of getting up in the middle of the night to change skills at least thats the impression i got and with new characters and people like me who are pedantic about skill training learning skills in the proper order then needing to inject rank 3 learning skills means exactly that also itd be nice not to have to come online wait for a skill to finish then inject and start training the new skill on the spot 24 hour window is niceras for what happens if the skillbook isnt present id say skip it and go to the next skill instead of pausing
thisits eve online not afk online play the game
you say that like skill training is the whole gamei still play the game i pew pew but i dont wanna get up earlystay up late to inject that skill
cause every high sec miner autopiloter and docker must be dualboxing right u want a grindfest that keeps everyone glued to their screen 247 to play to trainlvl go back to world of warcraft
i agree with the above if injecting a new skill is that important and ill be asleep or at work for eight hours invest that time in a less important skill for that tiny amount of time geez its a game
wtf is your problem i live in 00 quite comfortably my only complaint is its not as convenient in high sec but i dont have any issues with skill trainingget off your lazy arse and actually play the game stop ruining it for the rest of usthere are these really handy tools like evemon and evehq to tell me when the skill queue changes are coming upyou people are utterly helpless arent youare you such an ocdaddict that you have to get on right at the end of the training queueseriously you people need helpi have a full 24 hours notice plenty of time to get that skill injected and trainedwhat is the deal here how about a bit more thinking and less complainingwow is that way
1 wtf is my problem wtf is with that tone of yours when its just uncalled for2 how r we ruining it for the rest of u what difference would it make to your end if we had log on to inject we log on inject log off again how r we ruining it for the rest of u poor baby in fact just logging on would add to the server cluster so what u want is to crowd it even more if anything ure the one who wants to ruin it for the rest of us 3 edit so were utterly helpless ocd addicts when ure the one who needs addons to keep track of your 24hour notice which is still plenty of time for u i wonder if i can sig all of that4 what is the deal here how about a bit more thinking and less complaining5 if u wanna go back to wow where u value effort so much and going afk gets u nothing go ahead just dont try to drag us with u
oo i think this is the first time ive been told to gbtwowim not entirely sure how injecting your skills constitutes a 247 err 237 dualboxed grindfest if it takes you that much work to inject a skill i suggest taking the time to master the interface it shouldnt take you more than a few seconds to right click  inject skill if its taking you hours youve got bigger issues than i can help you with the point is the game already caters to an afk playstyle the skill queue was introduced because sometime changing your skill was just entirely inconvenient most of us have jobs lives sleep etc and it was affecting everyones ability to manage their skills  not to accommodate automated training
agreedeve online is for mature players people who take the time to enjoy the game and master itnot for kiddies who want to push the i win button and then go off and do something elseive pioneered if not 2nd the skill queue changes way back when csm was in its 2nd term and i never ever wanted it to be automated to that degreeif you not u bothered to read my post youd see that you get a full 24 hours to log in and change your skillsif your in high sec you have literally no excuseif you live in 00 jump clone down and pick up your skill and log off since your too damn busy to play the game anywayif u cnt fgur out hw to ply th3 g4m3 then dont bother come crying to us
if i want to train research project management and im finishing research level 5 and thats the last skill i need and it finishes as im arriving at work all the notice in the world isnt going to helpno matter what you cant set up the queue for skills you dont meet the prereqs for instead of spouting the crap you did and ive read your posts theyre usually not this uninformed and ignorant then youd know that this is what the op was talking about the op isnt asking for a longer queue or for the game to autostart training at the end of the queue the op is merely asking for one simple fix at the exact moment you finish the prerequisites for a skill that you ahppen to not be online to inject if the game could help you out as there is currently no way to set up a skill that you are freshly meeting the prereqs for if you arent online at the very moment the previous skill finishes
1 it doesnt u said its not afk online and to play the game which gave the impression that u only want active players playing the game thats why u could go back to wow because unless ure active in wow u get nowhere2 did u ever realize that convenience and accomodating automated training is one and the same1 noeve is a sandbox and its for everyone who enjoys it however they want even if they want to take it in moderation if it was only for ppl who spend assloads of time every single day there would be a minimum playtime requirement but there isnt and whats this i win button ure talking about cause i dont recall any high skillpoint char roflstomping a blob by themselves2 u dont want improvements because u dont want anyone else to enjoy eve but uu think eve should only cater to ppl like u who have nothing important to do with their time and it is an improvement because u have not once stated how it would hurt anyones gameplay in any possible way including yours3 yes ive read that part more than once but u also said u still needed addons to keep track of the queue4 so once again if i were to log on inject and log off how am i ruining your gameplay for someone who wants to nitpick youu u sure like to ignore the important points5 if someone couldnt figure out how to play a game he would not continue his subscription to continue playing no one has to play 247 just to learn the gamewell maybe u do
for someone who thinks im uninformed and ignorant you obviously dont read whats put in front of youi dont have a problem with injecting skills that are going to qualify upon training the preq within the queuei have a problem with making the entire process automatic to the point where you can afk the damn thing to deathif i have a queue opening up and i cant train the said skill until the one finishes i should be able to tack it to the end of the skilli do not want that to be automatic its not my problem your work schedule prevents you from playing a gamefor crying out loud people your like a bunch of whiny babiesccp wont allow that think about it before you start flaming mewhats next automatic purchasing of skills leveling upsounds like wow to methis is eve online deal with ittldr  inject skills that meet prereqs when current skill being trained will finish within 24hrs yesautomate the abovementioned idea hell nostop whining stop being lazy stop afking and go play the game
facepalm not touchin this one youre ed for making assumptionsthey didnt add the skill queue for convenience they added it because people were losing training time to circumstances they could not control training time is what people are paying for your not losing training time without an autoinject featureagreed eve doesnt take assloads of time metric standard or otherwise to master but it takes involvement minimum requirement wtf and you expect the rest of us to accommodate you and your gimme gimme playstyle sounds an awful lot like pot and kettle syndrome we dont want improvements because we dont want anyone to enjoy eve think about that for a minute rationally take more than a minute if you have to any automation tends accommodated afk playstyles read that as macroers farmers etc the fact that you have an inject skill button is an automated process that you should be happy with how hard is it really to train that skillis this a necessary feature no there are mechanics within the game that accommodate this you can train quite another till you get home  im sure that youve got more than one skill you need to trainwhat addons do you need no third party application is required to keep track of your skills evemon is just a tool to help you organize and plan not a required interface for keeping track of your skill queue youre attempting to hijack dev time for irrelevant crap and you havent spent the time to think about the widespread implications character farming would be easier macro creation things of that nature how is requiring people to log in and inject their skills impeding them from learning the game this game should require some sort of active involvement were not asking people to dedicate their lives to this  just to check in once in a while if it took you 237 to learn the game then my heart goes out to you i dont even wanna know what it took for you to learn to tie your shoes if thats the casewhos playing 247 nobody is implying this it takes literally 2 seconds to inject a skill before it took closer to 15 seconds real backbreaker there edit apparently my attention deficit wasnt letting me finish sentences
the first paragraph of your response have been gone over to death for whatever reason it has been argued down repeatedly that injecting skills you dont meet the prerequisites for is a bad idea just check the last 300 topics about this subjectthe op isnt proposing anything blatantly automated in fact i daresay his method takes more involvement with yours you might as well buy any skill you ever plan on training and inject them allowing you to set up your skill queue hwever you want personally i dont see a problem with this but the idea has again been shot down so many times in the past im not going to bother rehashing it herethe op suggests that you be able to queue up those skills for which you will meet the prerequisite just as your inject unqualified skills idea does the ops idea however requires involvement in the terms of setting up the skill queue to finish your prerequisites within 24 hours since that is what the queue allows having found and placed the desired soontobequalified skill at the end of the queue and finally to have the required skill book in your possesssion hold or current hangar since you can inject from cargo hold it actually ends up more complicated than simply injecting skills ahead of time as it takes that player involvement that you desirelastly i do apologize for the uninformed and ignorant comment and realize that an insult is not a good start to a civil discussion regardless your attitude towards my reasoning with this issue i do hope you accept my apology for the aforementioned comment as i believe it was just a misunderstanding of your post
first off read the ops proposal again i even bolded the bit that clearly says he wants it automatic it just begs the question at bestsecondly i apologize from my crass statements and i can respect your position in that contextthirdly your wrong about the idea as far as my idea goes being shot down it was carried up to the csm 2nd or 3rd not sure passedand then presented to ccp directlyas to whether ccp approved it or not good luck getting that out of the csm laughable as they areas to my idea allow me to specifically detail it hereif you have a skill your training up say minmatar frigates v and you wish to train assault ships frigates within the 24 hour queue provided all prereqs are met you can buy the book and inject itif you change your skill queue plan before the new skill you just injected triggers you lose the skill book you injected permanently to prevent abuse and thus have to buy it again much like an implantpros  its only a wee bit easier to plan your skills out and requires human interaction without going totally afk you still have to buy your books ship them with you until the 24 hour window opens upcons  you miss the 24 hour window you can only blame yourself in reality its no different then what we have now just assumes your going to meet the requirements within the window coding wise its just a series of if then elses and the i accidentally the titan skill scenario would make one scream in utter terrorautomating that process is wrong it would allow them to line up a series of books and just run off and not bother playing the game for prolonged period of time this would also increase char farming rmts and other nasty thingsso while you may think im a raving lunatic coughtrollcough i have my reasons
u still dont get itthe accomodation for circumstances beyond ppls control is convenience and u do lose training time when the next skill ure training cant be injected when ure not at the comp not everyones gonna be rdy at their comp to inject when the time comes because they dont have such a free schedule as u do if anyones ed for assuming its uthats the point i was trying to make which refutesnot for kiddies who want to push the i win button and then go off and do something elseso we all agree that u have to play the game to be good at it right its not like this new system is gonna make anyone a better player automatically since im sure ull agree that skill training is not an i win button its all for the sake of convenience for when real life calls is it that hard to understand oh im sry am i asking too much when i pay the exact same amount of real life money as u do and im not the only one asking for this eitherkeep that in mind1 the difference is we do not generate isk by afk skill training alone if we did ud be lumping yourself as a macroer farmer etc2 again with complacency would u like every single aspect of eve to be left the way it is after looking at every single thread on this board as well3 its not hard at all but answer this can u reach that comp while ure far away from it4 technically everyone has more than one skill to train question is what good is a skill if ure never gonna use it tell that to drake he thinks were ocd add whatever and hes notmerely because he uses an addon to keep track of his queue1 is it eve related yes its relevant is this thread locked or deleted no its relevant2 char farming wtf and macros for what
supported although i think there should be an option to turn it onoff
thumbs up to this idea
interesting
this would be very useful supported
yesimplement a whole new crafting systema new marketpesronalized itemsnew contracts systemhowever this is a whole new version of eve maybe the long prommised industry expansion and it all has to be done at the same time because for each of those things to work everything else must be changedso maaaaybe one day far far awayalso please post wild new ideas in the featuresideas part of the forum for discussion
it would however be super cool and be what t3 is supposed to be making your own modified ships and mods however there would be many issues with balancing and trading them
yay for you they did this with t3 ships problem solved
a fair request considering the ease and volume of isk obtained in hisec and he did say harder belt rats not just bigger bounties so i say supported  whilst requesting the 00 standard of rats be placed in lowsecgood idea
this is why you can do combat sites and scan other types of combat sites the fact that finding a 3 bs rat group in a belt is so damn easy to find and kill it pretty much deserves its current rate of isk income combat sites like sanctums and 610 1010 plexes do have a lot more income and are significantly harder than belt ratting and most if not all lvl 4s heck lvl 4s are ez mode now a days running a sanctum you at least have to remember to have a tank
not supported
definitely support this as someone that likes to keep the assets clean getting another rookie ship everytime i jc or hop to another station in a pod is extremely annoying really wish this had been implemented ages ago but sometime in the future works too
supported
exactly
1 disallow logging out in supercapital ships once built they remain ingame at all times occupied or not2 improve security of supercapital ships so that while not occupied they have at least a reasonable measure of securitypoint 1 is to address the concern that there are too many supercaps out there as they are effectively mobile stations and cannot dock then they should never be able to leave the game currently garage alts are the common way of storing them  just log out and make them invisible and completely invulnerable when not in use this makes them too easy to secure and contributes to their proliferation as they need no defenses while not in use and are completely invulnerablepoint 2 is to address that if these ships must remain in the game they should not be so ridiculously simple to walk off with there are many ways that this could be done better pos security options would be one wayaltering bumping to not be such a ridiculous tactic would be another allowing cap ships to anchor when not in use would be yet another allowing passwords on ships would be even yet another you can password a cheap can but not a multibillion isk spaceship which also has a crew of thousands huh makes no sense at allthere  a proposal which limits supercap proliferation allowing them to be targets and requiring assets to defend them when not in use rather than the dirt simple alt wand and which also allows those who dont like alts and believe that they are one of the mor broken things about eve to actually own these ships without either being chained to them forever or accepting completely ludicrous amounts of risk
what happens if the pilot gets dced in some form or a node crashes and the pilot can not log back in for some period of time while other pilots canie getting stuck on logging screen even if it were to be anchored it would still be vulnerable to attack and the ship would have to be pilotless as if the pilot were to dc than that would act like the character logging off or if the character were forced to stay logged in to eve but the player was logged off from the players computer how would the server act when the player tried to log back in from computer since the server would believe the character was already logged in i dont see anything like this ever being possible just the technical things with this just wouldnt make it fair for anyone and would cause a massive amount of unreasonable loses in super capitals what is the motivation for this idea i do not see the need or how it is an unfair advantage to have alts login and log out in a titan when they see fit
so proposal one failed and you directly come with the next
i dont understand you say you dont want them to be all over the place yet you want better securitynot supporting until its cleared up
all good questions lots of possible answers most of which depend on how ccp wrote the codeif for instance the ship was in flight with a fleet it might send out a message to the fleet command failure or some such and then another pilot could take command etcif passwords were an option this would allow only friendly pilots to board it other options are possible as well  thats just one way of doing it i would hope that folks who regularly fly supercaps have relatively stable connections but dc does happen and can be caused due to lag perhaps the ship would go auto like a pos and keep firing it does have a crew after all of course its possible  many things are possible as to massive losses well folks have been complaining there are too many around what better way to fix that than to let enemies find and kill themsome of us hate alts raises hand eve is supposed to be a sandbox a ship like a supercap is supposed to never be able to dock which means that in any sensible rpg world it must always be somewhere in the universe waving a magic go away and hide from the bad guys wand is about as nonsandbox as you can getand teadaze was whining that my idea of actually asking to be able to store one in universe sandbox style would lead to supercap proliferationthus an answer to that one im sure heshe wont like but an answer nonetheless
actually i want more security only for the ships when they stay in gameright now the standard security is to have a garage toon that just logs out in the ship whenever its not in use gone from the game invisible entirely invulnerable unfindable poof thats vastly better than anything im proposing anchoring passwords etc and thats why supercap pilots like the status quo theyre pretty much all alt happy anyway having gotten all their cyno alts etc etc that you virtually need to play the game at that level easily so a garage alt is no big deal to your usual supercap pilot or someone getting ready for one most cap pilots have alts for cynos too  i think im the only one in my corp that actually has to get real players to light my cynos for my carrier  the others sometimes do if its more convenient but they dont need to as they have alts on other accounts to do so if they need to jump soloright now  those logged off supercap ships are pretty much never in game unless theyre in use it does happen but its very rare they spend most of their time in logoffski landif just improved inworld security were to be added the result wouldnt actually be more supercaps as some maintain garage alts arent that tough to get and they are far better than storing the ship ingame which right now is too risky to really do so before getting the ship people buy or train a garage alt and then use that alt to log off in the ship perfect securityteadaze and co used the argument that any kind of improved security ingame would add to the numbers of supercaps something i very much doubt in unreasonable numbers my answer to that is that if true counter it but making them immune to the magic alt disappearing wandof course that would really cause waves for supercap pilots in eve who would actually need to find real solutions for storing their ships so i expect it wont be real popular
im gonna have to disagreeyou gotta keep in mind these ships are bloody expensive to field and they dont make themselvesprofliferation or not you have a crapload of isk to deal withwith the obvious cost of running an alliance alone going up up up its not likely going to go rampantsecurity is highly needed to encourage them to use them more oftenyou want them to get shot up encourage them to bring them out of there little cubby holes and come out to playthis is a pickle indeed but i dont think forcing them to stay on grid in some form or fashion wont help much
i was told it was technically not a proposal because i linked to it rather than retyping it all in this forumso this is just covering off that technicality for teadazeitll still die because the nonalt position seems to be very unpopular i expect but i felt i had to at least try
hey  thats fairi know  ive been considering a nyx i can fly one but was told flat out that without some kind of garage alt there is simply no current way ingame for it ever to be even remotely safe id be willing to work hard to build the shipmake the isk to fit it etc if it were even reasonable to keep it at a pos someplace sure the enemy could launch an attack but thats just a good reason to have a battle not a bad thing in my book im willing to take that risk  but not with the current mechanics which makes stealing them ludicrously easy ftc lost a rorqual to exactly such shenanigans about a year ago and the pilot who built it while she still has an account has almost not played since it ripped her heart out that muchim with you on that the on grid all the time thing is mostly for teadaze to answer her complaints of possible proliferation id be happy nee overjoyed with just reasonable ingame securitywell it is a lot more sandboxy and would certainly shake up the major alliances some probably more than dominion did
such witty repartee how can i ever hope to answer such a brilliant counterargument
the other thing is your likely going to open a can of wormssuch condition are going to be applied to titans and potentially other capital shipsthese things have a tendency to get a little out of handbut i can at least respect your argument on the matterand thus ill withdraw to my cave 
i remember a time when eve was so differenti remember a time when fight winner was not determined in the first second when piloting was a real factor that made you a great player or noti remember a time when gameplay did not favour kikoolols when your skill and your ship and stuff did not make 99 of the job when players did not runaway the battle as soon as they see theres one more ship in the ennemy fleet i remember a time when there was not so many kikoolols in this game when it was too difficult for them to survive cause you had to think a little about your fitting and your way of flyi remember a time when intys gave you a real sensation of being dangerous for your ennemy no matter the ship he has and so much things elsei remember a time when eve directions goal was not so much a marketing one targeting all wows kikollols it was such a great time
i remember a time when the assembly hall was for actual proposals
i support functioning neuroanatomy
i remember a time when people who posted here had half a brain and bothered to be rational and discerning enough to know what was considered a worthy proposal and not complete pile of 
now drake youre being unkind again dear this isnt a complete pile  its only half a pile at best

thats niceit isnt all of the time i dont see why this should be a problemit isnta made up wordits called realistic so your one more ship hyperbole aside you mean that the player base was fairly stupid and would refuse to run away on the basis of misplaced pridehonoragain this would go better if you didnt use made up words use englishyou have yet to explain who this them iswe dothat sounds stupid someone in a vastly inferior ship should not feel dangerous to someone in a vastly superior ship and define intysthen you were utterly deluded ccp is and has always been a business using eve online to make money this is the third time youve used what appears to be a gibberish wordstill is
oh yes i think youre right on this point and because it seems you think a bit more than the other i may precise what i define by a kikoolola kikoolol is a player who uses every possible way to avoid difficulty in a game such as engaging only the easiest target or profiting of every nonregular situation to make himself shining also you could meet them on forums they often reply to every topic no matter if they have a pertinent and constructive reply to share
im unsure what the problem is basically a kikoolol would seem to be an intelligent individual who is slightly critical
so what your saying is your a hypocritical kikoololbecause youve not given one proposal nor one solution this is entirely spam and as such im going to report it
i did that when it first showed up apparently like discussing forum bans for players spam is now allowed in the assembly hall

i did attempt to contact them directly and was told to stfu and go away for spamming two mails weeks aparti have repeatedly attempted to bring these topics to the attention of industrial side csms and have recieved little more than passing lip servicein one ear and out the otherindustrial players dont seem to frequent the forums nearly so much as those interested in pushing forward their personal agendas pve versus pvp et al because those have the most direct impact on individual player experiencebeyond that it appears i will have to suffer along in silence with the rest of the industrial crowd for lack of anyone giving a damn

the idea is that people who dont follow the law get a bad standing and cant enter certain areas people who do have nothing from itmy idea could lead into the profession of headhunter and more pvp in 0308tell me what you thinkhmm i think some reward for a high security status is somewhat fair seeing that acting agains law cause a drop in standingsthe main idea is to expand the security onto the low sec in order to see more people go to low secthe first part which came into my mind was that a bodyguard patrol is somewhat ridiculous even for us carebears but nonetheless on a small part this could be a good idea where even our bloodthirsty pvp friends could benefit frommy idea to this would be thisevery person with a sec status above 4 can attack pirates and gankers even if their corp hasnt been targeted like the have a sec status 5 till a sec status of the system of 06 on the low sec part this people get a higher security just on the gates of low sec 04 either the guns would have a higher power or the gates would fire as well so even a bs could not stand it longer then 15 seconds every gun is concentrating on a different target so for 04 id say gate concord board and 3 sentries make 5 targetsthe same system would go for a sec status above 45 but the hunting ground expands to the system of 08 in low sec that would go then into 03 concerning gate camps and a max tanking time for a bs of 20 secs 4 guns aiming at different targetsbeeing to much of a care bear i dont know about rewards is a reward by destroying the pod or just the ship if the pod the sec status above 4 should allow to pod as wellnaturally the pirates  gankers corpmembers must be only allowed to assist in 02 or below or they would suffer the gate defensesby helping concord doing this another incentive could be given out the headhunters could gain lp which they could change into a tradeable concord insurance basicly this tradeable insurance can be redeemed with a platinum insurance to insure a t2 ship to 75 of the value which on the other side hulk owner might consider as a stimulation going with their ships into low sec areas or deeper of course this makes only sense if the buyer has a certain sec status like 25 or above or maybe just above 05what are the pros imho of this 1 a new profession would be introduced headhunters2 causing more pvp between the sec areas of 03 and 08 3 a bit more security against gatecamps in 03044 more traffic into low sec 03045 marking gankers and pirates to all players with standing of 4 and more free to shoot6 high sec areas will be more security driven by players and less by concord7 possible more miner into low sec cause of buyable additional insurance on t2 shipscons1 pirates and gankers will have a hard time in 03082 i dont know how long the marking of a pirate last but id say 46 weeks time would be a good period open for ideas here3 gate camps are mostly done by 59 ships not all of them could be destroyed by concord in time but at least it would cause discomfort replacing 4 to 5 bs after a gatecampi hope you consider this as an honest try to serve both sides carebearstearbears
first uh what was that you were saying never mind
nice spam noobletop  not supportingi get what your trying to do but you got alot of holes in your logic and no ones going to really dig thata higher security rating gives you the ability to punish the lower sec rating or the one who decides to attack you if not pod youthe punishment for such an action such as podding exponentially increases when someone attacks a higher security rated pilot as opposed to a low onedont have the maths on me but thats how it was explained to meas to the overall benefitbout the only thing i could come up with as a plausible benefit would be a lower standings penalty accross empire when you  off someone or some such missioning or a increased standings increase for doing missions with higher sec ratingskeep in mind that its going to cause problems when it comes to people who rat up there security ratings just to get back into high sec so if your going to propose something you need to make the sec rating on said pilot worth moreand more costly than everhence why your not going to get very far without a lot of thought and effort put into this
i heard that too it would be interesting to see how much bigger the loss would behmm i am not sure if the lower standings penalty would be such a big bonus after all if you do such things you do it more often therefore youll never reach a standing which grants you that bonusthats where the flag comes in its like having a very bad standing frozen at a level which allows all other people to hunt you down at this moment the upratting would be a waste cause your standing wont improve till the flag time is over that would be the more costly price for doing pirating or ganking most carebears are asking for an insurance loss even tearbears have to confess that the amount of time which is needed to repair damaged security status cause of pirating or ganking is very less compared to someone who might have to replace a hulkso instead of losing the insurance which i now think would take some motion out of the game this could encourage people to do pvp and take defense in their own hands cause the offending character is free to shot for everyone the fixed flag time would even out a bit the amount of time you need to replace ie a hulkthe lame version would just be that depending on your sec status your insurance for t2 ships increases so if you reach 45 or 5 sec status you get 95 of your hulk or transport or whatever t2 ship replaced this could also a be a way to drive people into lownull sec but then i have to confess that would be unfair again against people with a low sec status living in null cause then a highstandingalliance can more easily attack with a t2 fleet and get it replaced if loosing
the one thing that i never understood is when someone ganks or pods someone in high security it was always very easy to get that sec rating back up provided you know what your doing and even then that knowledge is readily availableits not as soul destroying as some would lead others to believeso perhaps one way of increasing that value is not so much give a benefit but increase the penalty for attacking someone who goes to the trouble of maintaining a higher security ratingand then double if not quadruple the time required to get it backthen you run into a situation where people have to weigh the costs of committing criminal acts in the eyes of concordtop that off with the fact that you can still traverse high sec in a pod and do various things and work around concord to do your gankagebottom line the punishment is not high enough for people who wish to break the lawmany would support the removal of insurance for getting concordd or self destructing your shipthats a good start but the value of sec rating is quickly becoming a very very trivial thingyour idea as good intentioned as it is wont fly it wouldnt take much for someone to rat up the rating and become this said headhunter and cause some troublethe metagaming alone would cause some major problems hence the little paradox we have with bounty hunters and suchyou got a lot of territory to cover before you come to a reasonablerefined idea herekeep trying you may come up with something someone has yet to come up withjust remember to keep it balanced high sec is supposed to be safer not safealso as rampant as the suicide ganking is there are many things you can do to make that job harder if not little to no risk to begin withlike mining in whs or 00 most griefers are total and utter cowards they wont go there because they find themselves without the almighty concord to protect them that and getting blown up by fellow corpmates tends to have quite the effect on ones mindsetironically there argument for depreciating the mineral market by forcing demand up is totally bogus00 provides high end minerals for the high sec market low end is in high demand out here with little veld to go around and such we need supplies pumped up herethis isnt all high sec based they think in micro econmomic terms and not macro ironicmaybe they should spend a little bit of time living out in 00 learning how to survive in a economy that must pay costly sov bills eh
im not entirely clear on what youre proposing here but i dont think i like it it smacks too much of a solution looking for a problem
i have this idea that pop up in my mind from time to timeships that looks old and used the longer you had themlets say you owned a megathron or whatever ship since 2006 andhave used it alot then it should look really usedblack parts around the engines and guns lights that dont worksome armor plates bended due to hits paint missing in some parts etcmaybe supported with some sort of info about owner history and ship age in shipinfoedit forgot to support and sorry for my post being kinda ot

hi thereive been missioning a fair bit and noticed that nos and neut ships dont show any icons on the overview which can be annoying to say the least when youre in one of those mission areas where youre blinded by the surrounding light and cant see which ship the nos beam is coming fromhaving nos and neuts appear on the overview the same way ecms and websscrams do would be a great idea imo and i hope youll sign and support

this is needed and a complet drone overhul
voice is way too slow and inaccurate for detailed instructionsimagine trying to tell the computer which ship to target what coordinates or direction to fly all this while you have dozens of friendly and enemy ships buzzing around youthen add into the mix the odd names eve uses and trying to pronounce them correctly bei is that with a long e long i or long a soundi always get a chuckle at people wanting a voice interface there are definitely niche areas where thing like speed accuracy and range of vocabulary arent issues and it works ok but generally its not that practical
actually it could be much easier with additional voice control especialy when you have to do a lot at once and with defined commands it is quite accurate to target a ship the overview window could have numbers or ids for every entry in the list counting from top to bottom then you just have to call the numberid and not any random names setting a direction could be easier without the double mouse clicks too you could have commands like turn left 45UFFFD the ship does a turn of 45 UFFFD from its original course or turn up right 45UFFFDship turns right and up if you have a ship selected just say orbit target at 500 or approach target it would activate the buttons you have to reach and click with the mouse otherwise if this produces too much lag then dont use voice control in tense situations as you say there are plenty other moments in the game where you have no time pressure like mining traveling or being docked in a station where you can do a lot of practical stuff with voice control
yes it would be totaly awesome to be able to control everything with voice i could then set up other pcs that loopback voice comms into the mic input and control whole fleets of alts with sound alonethe reason ccp doesnt allow you to bind most ingame actions to a keypress is to make macros harder to create
the only way to fight macros is in adding complexity to the game not in limiting its features
i seriously hope youre wrong about that wows graphics were y when they came out and have not improved durring the years one of the things that attracted me to eve was the graphics i honestly thought that it was all production vids before i downloaded the client and was happily amazedwhere the eve graphics fail is in having clear understandable meaning itd be nice to be able to tell whats going on without having to refer to the raw spreadsheet er ui i mean
we also need antialising and proper shadows btw proper shadows

you ever hear about explosion velocity and signature radius yes they hit but for a damage you can die from laugh on caldariyeah unbonused amarr missile boats can hit at rediculos 20km 30km for torp on raven and 250 for cruise but rokh can shoot at surprise 250km caldari ships mostly have kinetic missile damage bonus and mostly resist holes equal to lost bonus damage so there is no diference unless caldaki will have bonus damage to all miseles or as for amarr no bonus at all since then jamming not affecting missile ships first you need to switch to fof and back for normals then jam is over and this takes at least 20 seconds and mostly use of fof make no difference at all only guided missiles have fofs making only half of weapons affacted by this  there is defender missiles but they shouls be ovehauled too and smartbombs that kills missilesyes thats why all missile weapons  countering should be overhauledhave you ever heard of null ammo rokh with nulls have 1716km range megathron 1116 without and traking modesyesno
this is true but some damage is better than no damage in fact missile ships are the bane of most speed tankerscongrats but can a rokh hit for the same damage at 250km as it can at 60km didnt think soderp rof bonus is just as good if not better than damage bonusboy i wish i had fof ammo for my laser hybrid and projectile weapons you have to be pretty pro to hit missile volleys with smartbombs and outside of caps who fits them nowmissiles are finecool story bro a mega does less than half damage at the same range a raven does full damageif turret users max out their support skills they get at most an extra 25 range out of their guns if missile users max out theirs then they get 100 extra range am i complaining nothey are two completely different weapon systems missiles can do some things guns cant and guns can do some things missiles cantlive with it princess

havent noticed that to do accepeble damage to a speed tanker you need to neut and web him same will work fine for turret ships you still missing point at 60km rokh damage more then raven at 200 but and 200 abit less so its still something in betweenyes thats why i see so many uberleetnoncaldarimissileships oh wait there is sacrilege its sooooo used ove zealotmaybe vengeance  no assaults are rarely uset especially this cruel joke of naturemayby huginn  typhoon but matari ust have split systems not specialized so mostly using both equallylachesis mmm still as pipular as sacrilege legion with missile system  but t3 ships in pvp a quite rare especially this config am i missing sometning  naglfar  but there is no missile bonus now so its just some extra dps on those launchers not main heapon to play with scissors paper is fine nerf rocktypical turret user1 and torps do less damage then you move faster then 106 ms thats for perfect raven and even 91ms for rage torps so he need to web you to do full damage 2 missiles hit for fixed damage turrets can crit closer to your optimal  more damage so if you get in your optimal you do more damage  nerf turretsyou have long range ammo live with it princess

if such modules gonna be created then current default range of missiles has to be lowered and i believe you wont like it
makes perfect sensefitting a missile enhancer low slot would be a choice that probably would mean losing a bcufitting a missile tracking computer middle slot  would mean less tank or less tackleso overall these modules would no make missiles op as many of the gun firing detractors knee jerk reactions would seem to suggestmore options for adjusting the performance of missile boats would be goodbetter hits against fast small stuff comes at the price of raw damage or tankand ahem  defenders are the equiv of tracking disruptors  if you dont fit them then stop complaining  and yes they are crap so complain about getting them fixed rather than spouting we dont have missile disrupters
supported as long as you mean 15 reduction in explosion radius and 95 increase in explosion speedand yes i do think that missiles need flight time halved and velocity doubled
not supported see above
can you fit a tracking disruptor on a raven yes can you fit defender missiles to a dominix nothere are no missile disruptorsop  id support this if the existing ranges of guided and unguided missiles were nerfed commensurately as it stands you have to fit tes at the expense of damage mods to make blasters useful even with null hint null buys range at the expense of tracking so its a bit hard to feel sympathy for hamtorp users who want to be able to boost their already significant range advantage
well thats one of the issues with defenders isnt it you need to use a missile hardpointthey should probably have a dedicated launcher  much like the probe launchers that dont take up a missile hardpointback to the op and requireing a nerf to justify the extra mods is just stupid reasoningthe op is talking about fitting choicesfitting a missile enhancer means using a slot that is currently used for something elseso no nerf is needed  a player fitting a low slot missile enhancer would lose dps much like the way a gun pilot fitting a te losing dps by losing a heat sinkgyromag stabthere are no extra slots to fit the op requested mods
op was saying that guns are overpowered compared to missiles because of tes and thats why missile enhancers are needed missiles are not guns and if you want one of the flexibility advantages of guns ability to fit a module to change engagement profile slightly then missiles need to be rebalanced around thatbesides theres already bay thruster rigs which provide the flight timevelocity bonus and painters which provide the same benefit as an explosion velocity bonus in reverse but for everyone in your gangseems to me that guns and missiles are balanced just different
rigs are neither here nor there  there are plenty of choices in rigs for both guns and missilespainters effect the sig radius stat of the enemy ship  they have no effect on explosion velocity which is the missile equiv of trackingthere would be no need for missile rebalncing because were talking about choices made at fitting timeexplosion vcelocity can be improved with this mods but something has to be given away at fitting time thats where the rebalancing occurs
derp it helps to catch them first many a time ive engaged a competant cruise raven or hml drake in my vaga and had to fly away whereas turret ships would have been ineffectually missing me all dayjust pulled up eft all level 5 raven with 3 damage mods and faction cruise 518 dps253krokh with 425mm ii and 3 damage mods 553 dps 54 30 320 dps at 19430 hardly a bit less and the raven still has 2 utility highsturret slots and a bigger drone bayi see plenty of sacs its just that most amarr players havent trained missiles and the zealot has more utility in a lot of snipe hac gangs hence you also see more eagles than cerbs get over it i dont really see what your point is yes some other ships have missiles as their secondary weapon system and recieve an approapriate bonus to it as i said 5 rof bonus gives you more dps than a 5 damage bonusactually kiddo you can check my killboard ive probably lost more missile ships than youve had hot dinnersirrelevant turrets wont hit a moving target with transversal as well or even at all turrets can also glance a target for less damage boost turretsso do you
no missiles are not turrets and turrets are not missiles they need to be distinct i agree that some missile types especially roflkets need an overhaul and perhaps do more paper dps than turrets at the cost of not applying full damage to your typical target without webbing and target painting this however is not the way to do it
lol thats defenetly a point bs  hac bc  hac problem is not in missiles its still fitting oh wait is there something missing on rokh  damage bonus comparing to 5 rof on ravenchecked others  apoc having 700dps on 60km and 400 at 200  exactly there is no point in training missile line just for one ship there must be real reason for that yes coz cerbs are inferior comparing to eagle in terms of long range shooting and people use mostly more effective shipspoint is that most of caldari missile ships have kinetic damage bonus not rof yes rof is better i agree give caldari rof bonus instead of kineticchecked 0 kills 1 pod loss sure learn to control your ship to affect transversal not just press f1 f2 f3
the only module i would support is improvement to explosion radius and maybe flight speed however stats yoy are suggesting are rediculously broken that would result in increasing missile range by 50 can i please have a magic nuke that kills people from the different end of a solar system
regardless missile ships are much better suited to driving off speed tanked ships i was just throwing that out as an exampleraven has 75 effective missile launchers rokh has 8 effective turrets i dont see the issueas for lazors well they are in need of a bit of a nerf imho but also eat up cap regardless that 400 dps at 200 km is still less than the raven and nobody fits 8 tach apocs anywayits not that theirs no point people have the option and plenty take it its just that traditionally missile skills and amarr dont go well together qq morebaww range on the cerb is a non issue for a start seeing as you are not advocating instant hit missiles i think well let your obvious statement pass there are plenty of occassions where you would fly a cerb over an eaglemost do and kinetic is one of the better damages to have a bonus on its a bone of contention of mine though and not the issue at handhi you must be new around hereyes you go ahead and do that
and turret deal instant damage on range i can live with bothmore lolz if you dont fit them dosnt mean noone does all i see is you qqing with no thinking out of straight lines sadno i wont flyed all hacs and cerb is last in line i would take into combatno its not
rokh is the worst sniper ship in eve regardless of it overgrid fire rangeabout 400dps at 250 kilometres missile speed is 7850ms so it will take 32 seconds to deliver 2900 points of damagelets take a spherical battle where apoc fighting against raven at 190km sniperangeraven 1900007850242seconds to deliver first 2900 damageapoc has instant damage delivery so we dividing ravens delivery time with rof and multiplying with volley damage 242731228775712and just to make clear that caldari sucks we bring here the rokh 24258615976595 15 less damage 25 less tracking speed than apoc at the same rangeall three battleships have 2 damage mods and 190km optimal range skills are allvat last you can see that turret platform has at least 3700 points of damage legup against missile boats at 190km rangeif there will be ten ravens against 10 apocs at 190km range then three of them will pop before their missiles will reach the targetso shut up all of you whining that missiles must be left intact
all very good now compare 10 torp ravens to 10 megapulse apocs at 10km and the situation is very differenthorses for courses caldari have a long range option for bs slug fests two in fact if you are unhappy with the performance of rails then train lasers or projectiles its that simple

thiswell yeah missiles make crappy sniper ships nobody is disputing that i hear that if you put up 10 apocs against 10 charons you can really massacre caldari ships thing is what you propose wouldnt actually change any of this in any way so umgood for you
current situation there are three kinds of missile battery for pos defence  cruise torp and citadel torp citadel cruise have been added to the game but do not have a pos defence associated with them instead citadel torp batteries have a x12 range multiplier to serve in the ranged role proposed solution recreate the citadel cruisecitadel torp split for pos defences add a citadel cruise battery module to provide longranged missile firepower for pos towers remove some of the range bonuses from the citadel torpedo batteryprobably drop it down to x2 velocity and nothing else and increase its dps ensure that both are actually balanced against their turret counterparts when you do this  either remove their cpu need or give them stats good enough to justify it if you can work in a change that makes normal cruisetorp batteries not laughably bad thatd be nice too benefits allows better choice of defences on pos towers also itd be more internally consistent drawbacks as long as theyre made to be actually usable none if theyre still jokes after the change ccp will be wasting their time on a module that no smart people will be using
makes all the sence in the world for that to happen
pos missile batteries need sorting out when attacking poses in the past i always used whether or not a pos had missile batteries how many and what type as a baseline of what sort of defence the owner would put up 
supported
supported but in all due seriousness do people actually use missile batteries to defend pos i mean being one of the few defense systems that shut down if the tower goes into reinforced isnt their usefulness somewhat limited to begin witheditand the following post answered that question
supportedbtw i asked ccp weirdfish about this when citadel cruise missiles were introduced on sisi he said he was unsure if it was being worked on iirclarge caldari pos with cyno jammer and 110 cruise missile batteries
theres a reason i asked that they get a very serious buff in the process you realize thats a really terrible fit right each cruise missile battery does 17 dps even after the towers bonus you can get 50 more dps out of beams even on a caldari tower for less pg and no cpu cruise batteries are a special kind of bad
the lag alone would be bad enough
not to mention the extreme amount of gunners youd need to man the towergive them a buff and remove the cpu req maybe at the price of increasing grid would depend on how much you buff them and then do this if you wont do that this change will indeed be a waste of developer time
supporting the original proposal and suggest adding rethinkrework pos missile batteries in generalmaybe this could be another caldari tower bonus 100 reduction on cpu so missiles can actually be used after the tower comes out of rfmore variety is good and missiles are not exactly worth the cpu as they stand
oh snap someone struck a nerve
not really bro i liked your previous edit better you can throw my previous little indiscretion at me until youre blue in the face i dont care i regret doing what i did i was punished thats that i even found some amusement in the emo rage that was generated afaik nobody died and ccp didnt lose any subscribers due to csm dissillusion if anything it was probably the opposite no publicity is bad publicity right
from my perspective and this is of course purely opinion an alt is any character who acts primarily as a subsidiary in some way for your main regardless of what account it may be attached to so different from the definition you would use that doesnt make yours wrong im just explaining what i mean when i use the termi have another character on my account for instance but he has nothing to do with my main i flew him for awhile until i realized that i couldnt train him he was created expressly to play around in fw briefly considered another account for him so he could train and then had to be sensible about my real world time committments and simply shelved him i dont have anything like the time i want to fly my main character and i certainly dont have the time for another one at least right nowthe real world is a pain sometimes
it is possible yes and for some players it might even be enjoyable  but i suspect very very very few few enough that for most intents and purposes its closer to jumping out of a plane without a chute than it is to say painting your house green instead of whitethis is a game one is supposed to enjoy it one is also according to ccp be able to play it completely without alts perhaps this meets your litmus test for playing without alts but given that it would make doing something that im doing for fun rather unfun it does not meet minei dont think ill bother with the reply id originally written for that suffice to say that i am entirely unconcerned about your ability to eat anything more complex than grass
if you run out of arguments attack the other persons in the discussion that will always lead to success
if being locked in a supercap all day doesnt meet your definition of fun then dont do it you are still able to play the game completely from within your floating death palace with one or two exceptionsi can think of a couple of dozen things to do in the game which other people find fun without the use of alts or even in general but i most certainly wouldnt does that mean i should lobby for each of those facets to be changed so that i find each particular facet fully enjoyable on my own no it doesnt
oh its far more than one or two exceptions i could list them all but id run out of characters ill just list a few1 mission in empire2 visit my research agents3 fly anything that doesnt move like an iron bathtub filled with neutronium4 go on roams with my corp5 compete in frig tournaments or for that matter any kind of tournament6 run smuggling missions in my blockade runner7 for that matter fly any of my other ships which number a few dozen at a guess without countingas i have said i could go on reality is that i could rat do limited plexes those without accel gates and fight in fleet battles occasionally i couldnt even do market stuff without assistance as i couldnt dock id even need someone to bring me ammoyou realize you wrote that badly rightthis is probably not the place to debate the to alt or not to alt for the game as a whole  that discussion is long and neverendingccp says you can play the game without alts i say that if you own a supercap no you cant you disagree fine neither of us is going to convince the other
dont even go there you and i know exactly where its going to end up atand your not going to be the one to win that argumentyou can be entertained all you want the truth is still the truth and it will not be ignored

ok im probably just going to get ripped to shreds here but ill throw this idea out herenew sov upgrade supercapital anchoring relay probably strat 3 or 4new fuel bay on titansscswhatever the hell else they make later anchoring fuel baynew menu option for above ships anchor for selfanchor for corpyou fly it to an unoccupied moon anchor it and it effectively becomes a tower exact numbers to be determined without guns im not sure whetherhow much of a reinforced timer would be a good idea so i leave that to wiser minds ive left the details a little vague here because id rather the solid numbers come from someone with more large alliance experienceif you want to get really evil about it make it so that supercaps dont ever disappear when you log out but that might be overkill
i would make it so that they have to be left at poses or cloacked in deep safespot otherwise they stay hovering in space when you log off you should be able to leave it at a pos with it being impossible to bump away cant see makiing supercap vulnerable as anything bad as opposed to have it vanish
things on that list i also cant do if i choose to be a 10 pirate1 mission in empire2 visit my research agents in empirei could also add other restrictions but it basically boils down to large areas of space being off limitsnow if you cant see the similarity here and are going to spout the but you can use an alt line then you are invalidating your own argument it is completely possible to live as a 10 pirate without any alts but it is just a bit harderlet me break it down to the level you might understandif you choose to be 10 or join factional warfare you cant do certain things in game even if you park your ship in lowsecfw friendly space we agree on that correctif you choose to be in a supercap you cant do certain things in game but you can choose to park the ship at a pos we agree on that correctyour answer to point one was people use alts to get round it well that is true for many people but they are not forced to just as they are not forced to become 10 some do their choiceyour answer to point two is to complain that ccp are forcing you to get an alt to get round it or risk leaving the ship at a pos where some nasty thief in your corp will nick it again you are not forced to get an alt but some people choose to you could also join a more trustworthy corp now those two arguments are exactly analogous with the one exception that if you choose to be 10 you are restricted far more than you are if you decide to get into a super cap specifically because you have the option to park a supercap at a pos with the risk that have to trust the people with pos accessi agree that you can play the game without alts i choose to have alts because i can and i dont have any issue with themyou havent proven you cant play without alts nor have you proven ccp are forcing you to all you have proven is that some people can use alts to avoid the issue you would have due to your position on altsim also glad youve written off the csm because two of the members publicly and one more privately think the current supercap system is fair please feel free to ignore the hours of debate on other better supported by the playerbase issuesive attempted to discuss my position with logic and politeness and in return i get abuse and claims i dont play the game  i play the game enough to know how unbalancing unrestricted supercap ownership would be yes some people choose to use an alt to make it less difficult but that is a choice not required or enforcedwell i will say no more on this issue unless you feel the need to attack me again or it crosses the csm agenda  but you already know i wont support it
this is to be honest diverting the argument somewhat away from the realities of capital ships etc and into other things about using alts to get around penaltieswe could go there but i expect that we wouldnt agree on that either one of my main reasons for disliking alts is that they do let you get around the penalties of being a pirate etc much too easily in fact so easily that the penalties are largely a joke and have little real ingame meaning at alleven if you were a 10 pirate and didnt use alts which is how i will play it if i ever decide to play that aspect of eve its nowhere near as limiting as supercaps not even closeno and thats the heart of the argument parking a supercap at a pos with the current rules set is not a realistic option  which is why its almost never done they are so valuable and so easy to steal at present that it just isnt doablewhich is the point of the proposal  make it doable not with perfect safety ive never asked that by any means but with a more sensible level of risk come now  thats straw man any active corp of any size like say one that could support characters with supercaps cannot be trustworthy enough in the current rules set its simply too big anything over about five or six real humans and its too big all corps recruit etc if they are healthy and all it takes is one character in the corp for even a few days and poof no more supercap the character could have a stellar background etc and just have been purchased etc by an enemy player just to infiltrate real life vetting is basically not possibleour corp is not huge maybe 2030 real humans active at any one time yet we lost a rorqual last year to exactly this and we were smaller then the person had no permissions at all other than being able to enter the pos shields one quiet night his allies showed up bump bump bye bye rorqual the ships in the ship array were fine because they had no access to it including some capital shipsif this were true we wouldnt be having this conversation the limitations are much more extreme in the one case which makes them not exactly analogous at allthe reality is  with the current rules as they are  that pos access is just too risky if we had better pos security options id be cool with that if we had the ability to anchor to prevent bumping id be cool with that you dont seem to want to admit it but it comes to this  leave your supercap at a pos and its gone in 60 seconds okay  maybe a month but you wont have it very long at alli believe ive adequately proven you cannot own a supercap without alts and still meaningfully play the game its you who havent proven your position that it can in any way be safely parked you were the one who started with the condescending attitude not i thats what got you written off disagreement is fine but talking down to people and not even intelligently discussing their points will get you dismissed every time and so it should
no it is purely me pointing out as i have done a few times now that there are many other things in game that require you to live with the decisions you make one such decision being supercap ownership which comes with the disadvantage of not being able to dock itbut you are not forced to use alts which is the point i have been trying to put to you if you want to play pure and not have an alt you can is it as easy no  i never said it wasno you have just shown it is harder without an alt but not proved it isnt possiblei dont have to prove it can or cant be safely parked all i had to do was disprove your lie that ccp force people to use alts it is perfectly possible to own a supercap and keep it safe by sitting in it like other things in game as ive again proven above you have restrictions placed upon you yes people can use alts to get round it but that is their choice many supercap pilots remain in them at all times just as many of them use alts to park themyou can park it empty at a pos but there is risk doing soyou are the one who wants to raise a proposal to change the game you instead complained that ccp were forcing you to use altsexcuse mei take exception to this because i have been polite at all stages if you took offence from me sayingthen that was simply me pointing out you should have actually read how the csm procedure works in the first placeyou wrote me off for statinganyone looking at my posting history in this thread other threads the csm meetings and in game would see i support my opinion with reasonable debate i fail to see where i have not done so here perhaps you would like to point to something that means my statements should be dismissed every timeand you were the one who accused me of not playing eve and in your other thread that i whined about x when i did no such thing i simply pointed out the drawbacks and issues if your argument was sound you wouldnt need to resort to mud slinging at me or the other csm members
apocrypha made this subject redundant last year people now have a choice if you dont want local go live in a wormholeben
fixed
im a miner who likes wh space and the way it works the removal of me and my stats in local is good imo as it means the players who manage to get past our wh guards still got to try and track me down before i can get back to the pos what i would suggest is to create a decent tool for gathering info is quite easy we already have it the directional scanner in wh space if i spot an unknown ship on directional then i run for safe spot just make it that you can preset the directional with an automatic cycle rather than having to constantly press the button and if your not paying attention to directional and get ganked well only got yourself to blame as for the cloaked ships the gankers are not the only ones with cov ops ships we usually have several close by to our mining ships to quickly lock down anyone who tries to gank the minersindustrials and have caught plenty or cov ops and t3 ships using this tactic so i support removal of me being in local
youll note that i specified the secretary not all nine of them the secretaries thus farankh oz meissa tea have all been more or less reasonable folks  the jokesters tend not to want the workload that position implies yeah we noticed admittedly necro is less bad in this forum than in many others but its still generally poor practice  messes with too many peoples heads
as any player who has ever experinced severe lag knows how frustrating that it is im not talking about lag where all your acitons are delayed by 30 seconds im talking about being on the receiving end of a blank screen for 30 minutes then suddenly having an insureance mail arrive whilst still on a completely blank screen then waitng another 20 mintues to either load a completely war torn grid in a pod or show up in a station ccp in my very honest opinion this is a horrific burdon on your part i find it utterly appaling that you continue to release promotion videos for a game 
while i can understand your frustration but pushing 15001600 people into dg was just no good idea all in all we dont need more threads about the lagccp is aware of this just in case you missed the ingame news this thread or this threadthey are awarethey are working on itand your posting is not a proposal just whining get a tea fit a new ship and hope the next fight would have less than 1500 in local
lag is a really big issue but i dont think it can be solved without any change in game mechanic here is my analysis on what causes blob to be a winning tactic and my proposal to act on gameplay mechanic to change it and fix lag once for allthis obviously does not exclude working on technical problems but i state that lag will not be fixed with technical improvements people will keep packing in a single solarsystem until in crashes or lag becomes so terrible that they decide to log off my proposal would require to split fights over many solarsystem in a constellation setting a minimum of solarsystem to contest at once with constellationwide reinforcement timers please check it it this thread and contribute
and while you are at it when the scan is complete show the full market value of all the loot sorry cargofittings
i do not support thisthis is heavily aimed at making suicide ganking even easier  quicker in terms of the decision loop id be all for adding a universal view market details or view available contracts right click on any item but this as proposed is please boost ambushing passing ships
i will support this as soon as i can fit a module to reduce the chances of that cargoship scanner of getting a good read on what i have
this
although i dont like suiside ganking my personal rule of thumb is that game should not be balanced by making something more clickes away if suiside ganking is to be nerfedcontained which is shall it shall be done by other means
cross training is bad for balance wtf this is eve not wowcross training makes you a more versatile pilot the more skips you can fly the tricks you have up your sleeve to be honest it sounds like you have no clue what your talking about the purpose of most caldari missile boats are long range pve in my book if you want a pvp sniper fleet go amar or minmatar or at stated above go for a caldari gum boat they are there you know if you fly caldari and only use missiles you can only use half the shipsthat would be like flying minmatar and training the following gunnery skills missile skills drone skills shield tanking skills and armour tanking skills
so what youre saying isremove the drawbacks of having high dps at 200km range and the diversity of weapon systems in doing somake missiles act like fighters without needing to train for a carrieryou dont want to waste caldari navy scourge missiles if your target warps awaythese changes would make being a caldari player even easier and even more boring
ive always desliked the way missile spray wastes huge amounts of dps at any rangei support your first proposali think that any unexploded missiles  of the firing ship  should attack the next target you activate your launchers on as the firing ship still has control of those missiles
i was wondering if warping missles might only work for torpedos and citadel size missles which also means theyd be only really effective against larger targets the idea behind it is that smaller sized ship engagements are not affected besides it makes sense that only really big misslestorpedos are big enough to fit a warpdrive on them anyway it however also paves the way for a person with a laser pointer to target a ship that his buddy who is orbiting another planet in the system could then fire his missles at the missles warp to the planet where the target is being pointed et voilUFFFDyour thoughts
it would be interesting to find out how well the eve community rates its gms in handling petitionssplit in to different areas such as 00 low sec and empire then broken down under petition category im curious to see how well the eve community rates its gms and their policies volume of petitions vs expansion dates and so onmaybe the gms and whoever dictates gm policy could use this information as a kpi in how well they deal with petitionsto prevent people from using this data for metagaming purposes the data should be released only on a monthly or even quarterly basisreleasing this information would let some transparency shine through on to ccp something the company lacks at the moment if its clear that deficiency is found in a certain area then perhaps ccp could open a more direct dialog with its customers to see how they can improve customer service
would be really interesting to see this kind of statisticssigned
fyp not supported though
well clicking on a value between 1 and 10 really isnt that hard i think with a bit of common sense gms can easily understand why the petition received the score given we all need to remember that gms themselves arent programmable massmessage distribution systems and the policies they enforce are crafted by the higher ups in ccp so what im saying is even though sometimes they come across as emotionless robots theres a person behind that canned message i hope even so as mentioned before the release of this information is needed to let the community know how well they are supported and what they should expect of course if ccp declines to do so it merely reinforces the opaque and carefree image the company is projecting upon itself through some of its policies
what good would the information do us some people cant be satisfied so even a perfect gm team will have imperfect ratings and people will just whine about how its not high enough and they need to do better and its not like ccp will listen any more to us if we have the ratings data than if we dont  they know the numbers they know if its a vocal minority thats annoyed or a widely felt sentiment i think they should share the data with the csm but putting numbers out publicly seem like pain with no gain
they showed the stats to the csm3 i dont think i can exactly post the pagedont know if i even still have it but the ratings went up they were giving a whole presentation about how everything got better with the gms since 2007or 2008 i forget in categories like waiting time score number of responses till it was closed and i think gm count if i remember rightits worth a devblog though stats are always interesting
this would only add to the critism ccp gets now as the petition system is brokentakes too long to respond and in alot of cases even though they have the persons email and character info you get a message saying petion closed failure to respond the person filing it was never made aware they had a responce  so ill assume if you cant answer the question make it look like the capsuleer dropped the ball go team they need to look at all thier promises made on the net to the public only to fail at everyturn
pain with no gain they gain a more transparent image and we can see who the whiners arethey added the rating system and have never spoken out to the userbase about what theyre doing to improve customer service
not supportingwe have no business knowing what they dothats ias job
while i agree with you broadly thats actually not ias job ias job is to investigate corruption not user satisfaction
not supportedi agree with drake draconis those are performance reviews and are between the gm and their boss
i would think ia would be interested in seeing negative feedback statistics over gmsisnt that what they are supposed to do supervise not just investigate if not provide some oversight how else are they supposed to get there dataeither way we both agree not our business it does nothing more than cause needless epeen stroking and griping over something we have literally no control overits like throwing a fit over a killmail it happened what the  you gonna do about it o pthat and no one would be satisfied with the amount of information people will continue to ask for more or claim its false blah blah blahno ones going to lift a finger to open that can of wormsif people are that upset they would quit funny they never leave they just whine some more
i suppose the problem would be reduced if people could not vote on a member of their own alliance this ofcourse brings forth a host of other problems but it might still be worth it
i thought about that but then the really good people who have large alliances backing them would be cut off as wellnasty pickle to be sureyou should start a different thread about this this thread is not what i call a good way of discussing the csm troublesas i think disbanding them is a baaaad idea

the only accountability an elected cms representative or any elected official has is to the ballot box likewise the only tool the membership has is to exercise their voice and approval or disapproval thru the ballot box i understand all the issues and concerns laid out from not enough information on canditates to large alliances casting majority votes for their pet member to the memberships inability to do anything about the poor performance of an elected cms representative the process however is like any other democratic process and unless the membership really gets involved these problems will not be mitigated i would concentrate more on the election process and attempting to better inform and motivate the member base they need to feel comfortable that they have the information they need to place an educated vote for a particular candidate to represent them and motivated that their representatives and the cms system will repond as intended  on behalf of the membership base
well as i said a couple of posts ago i actually feel that taking the human factor of the csm out of the picture is whatll fix our problems it wouldnt really be a csm anymore though just give players the ability to get their opinions directly to ccp in the form of survey results and you wont need a csm
you can never take the human factor out of any group of peopleccp includedthe fact this is a democractic process is a insult in itselfdemocracy implies people are discerning enough to know the difference between good and bad in the end all a democratic process gets you is a popularity stuntlike it is in real life which doesnt really matter a whole heck of a lot even today thank you oh so very much college electoralsuch things translate to the current csm you have a democratic process of election note the quote marks   and then you look at who really votestherein is your problemi didnt vote last time around because a i was very tired and lazyb i had no incentive to vote let alone lift a damn finger because i was so ed off at mazz and lark for the bull stunt they pulledpeople are going to react just like i didwhy bother why should they vote when its a laughing stockwe are just single individual pilots how many votes will it take before someone can make a difference in the end its a futile gesture to even votefix that problem and youll get somewheregive the people an incentive to vote no not bribing  o p 
in the system i propose there would be no need for voting because there is no csm
granted but no csm is worsewe need gamers who are discerning enough to relay problems and ideas to ccpmaking them listen to potentially 50 to 60 thousand pilots is not what i call a smart movecommittee or not the csm is nice for that particular problemhowever the individuals who are put in the csm well perhaps its time we inflict more qualifications and less grandstanding
i reckon youll always run into the corruption problem in any electoral system you could have ccp hire phds in psychologygamedesignpolitics to form a permanent csm which might reduce the problem but thats pretty close to what im saying minus the survey tools which i think a permanent csm made up of educated people would opt for anyway
i honestly doubt a phd let alone a bloody psychiatrist is going to know anything about eve online to be quite honestthe people who get hired to do the job should be unbiased seasoned eve pilotsgood luck finding that
i disagree the permanent csm would only be relaying the messege theyre there to figure out what people want not how to give it to them thats up to ccps game designers id imagine the permanent csm are statisticians and psychologists who know how to set up surveys and how to analyze them
think about what you just saidwho would you rather deliever the message someone who understands and has done whatever the hell it is your doingwe dont need to be pyschoanalyzed and share our problems while lying on a couchwe need people who play this game on a frequent basis people who understand the mechanics and day to day struggles in working around the problems and trying to come up with solutionspeople who have no agenda and not interested in grandstanding or getting a free trip to fanfest and dont give a crap about usgetting some phd or some psycho to listen to us is a total waste of time
the people relaying the messege really have no need for playing experience the designers who decide what to do with the data however do i consider it a mistake that csm members see themselves as needing to know what fixes players problems thats gamedesign not the task of a representative of the people a representative needs to know how to listen and people who have surveys and statistical analysis in their trackrecord of education can do so
alright let me attempt to explain what i meani work for a computer shop i sell pcs and macsi also fix them im a certified tech a professional apple care technician to bootwouldnt you rather talk to the tech who fixes them as far as purchasing a computer as opposed to some punk sales kid whos more interested in getting a commission checkwho would you trust moreeve is its own world its own culture you try to explain eve to some average joe who plays wow and they are going to go glossy eyedi would expect the same for some random phd or some suchbottom line  eve is like its own langauge if you dont speak it know it fluently hireing a translator is going to be foolishi do not want some random joe to handle the critical process of collecting and coalating data for ccp when it comes to critical matters such as lag or skill injections or supercapital shipsi would rather have someone who knows how to fly that said ship and dare i say is intimately familiar with itnot someone who knows how to read a book and generate stats hell anyone can do thatfew can play eve online and know it well enough to relay informationnot even i would fit that job im just starting and ive been at it for a little over 2 years if not atfurthermore my pet peeves with mazz and lark whom i seem to pick on frequently are there actions not there experienceif either of them tell me this ship does this and this way because ive been doing this for this long and thats that im not likely to argue with themi will argue with them when it comes to there stance on ethics and accountabilityso when it boils down to my large sore spot with those 2 its political not experience in evebottom line yet again if we dont get people who are experienced with the daily life of eve they have no business representing us let alone dealing with the data they collect
granted but the expertese youre after tends to come in a package deal along with the personal interest such an expert has invested in the game aswell as that he cant be held very accountable being that hes just a player not a payed employee who has his livelihood depending on his ability to keep his jobalso a lot of experts lack the other skills required to be a representative they feel theyre so keenly aware of the game and what it needs that they stop to listenwith permanent employees who have good credentials you will lose some of the experience and gain reliability which in my view is a good trade would ofcourse be nicer to get both but how do you go about getting that
thats why i said unbiased experienced pilotsbut again i dont know how surely someone around here has an idea that would involve keeping what we got but altering the rules or the process of election to make it fit betterperhaps you force them to leave there various alliancescorporations much like an isd volunteer this would force them to be detached to a degree and would have to do a great deal of work around to get anywhereand to prevent alt abuse require a 2 year old pilot age requirement to get elected in the first place for those with more than one account verify via credit card records and such hell they ccp want a passport its just gonna be a little obvious if they are frakking aroundno one should be allowed to run if they are on an different account if thats not a rule already it should bethis keeps the repeat alternate crap and people who get thrown out from coming back without a great deal of effort and cost to there ownnothing stops them from doing alliance business but it would give the impression of neutrality and less on judging them due to there ties to whatever allianceit may not be perfect but it would cause alot of frustration on the current status quo and may change it up juuust enough to make it work
to be honest im rather sceptical of that that would work mostly because in order for the people to have faith in the system again it shouldnt look too much like the csm we allready know or theyll argue that it hasnt really changed and theyll still have biass against it and without good playerbase involvement it wont work no matter what we do
csm is hated because of peoples actions not because of the csm itselfthey just dont know who to blame so the csm gets slapped aroundso change the behavior of the csm and get people to try againrestrict who can run and who cant make it harder to get ini would give it an another shot if convinced there was a good shotbut shutting it down would be worse
i dont think the average human being works that way theyll want to see radical change before scepsis goes away in the end even if the change is just cosmetic in nature id still support the main idea of disbanding and reforming the csm or the idea behind it
the above posters are correct its meant to be expensive for a reason that being said i wouldnt think theres anything wrong with providing the bpos and making it expensive to manufacture componentmineral wise so that wh inhabitantsnullsec alliances could have easier access to themofc i dont live in wh space or nullsec so
as long as it costs basically the same to build as to buy from npcs maybe a 510 discount but no more im fine with this
im pretty much on the side that says if it can be bought it ought to be player produced there are other more efficeint ways to get isk out of the game docking fees crew costs etc npc products used for this purpose feels like a false market because it isedit the thumb is imprortant
docking fees and crew costs are the worse way to remove isk from the game as they can make the game unplayable for people with little isk unsubbing for a period and returning to a negative wallet because you have paid crew fees witout getting isk would push people to isk buying or abandoning the game
those were just two throw out suggestions and there are easy work arounds for those the point was that there are better ways to remove isk if it becomes a concern the player market works well one of the most important aspects of the game as far as im concernedand should be as open as possible without npc interferencethis is completely besides the point but since you threw some red herring arguments into the mix ill address them if youre intersted the crew fees would only apply to ships with crews and only when youre flying thus frigates would cost nothing in terms of those docking fees could also be by ship type and its a one time charge not an hourly fee second your home station determined by medical clone could be free of charge or it could just be one of those two or somthing else entirely there are so many ways to work this that making the argument its unplayable is ridiculous also we arnt talking about huge sums here 
a if you want to do just two throw out suggestions try to avoid those that are evidently bad if you make them they must be taken as serious suggestions you suggestion is part of this thread so it is valid to comment upon it again pay the crew to fly the ship while good for immersion could break the game for people low on isk b we want everything to be player made is not a good idea and this suggestion is part of that line of thougt the game need isk sinks and the dependance to supply lines to npc providers for some item c nanite paste is a luxury not a indispensable item like ammunitions or ships so it is a item well suited to be produced only by npc
i want a button on these forums that shows a downward pointing thumb to show i do not support the topic
im almost certain that this one has already been raised to ccp likely several times by now everyone agrees but it cant be expected before the forum software changes hopefully those are coming this summer at which point this sort of change would already be in the works
well now that they killed the only decent way to make isk while being in fw surprise surprise we see a mass exodus from fw amarr militia needs corps
yes we are very sorry that militias now have to work for their navy geddons a bit more than before but what i gather from my friends in militia it isnt all that hard to make lp quickly
i read the above as i dont know what im talking about but people who did actually participate in fw and knew what they were talking about said this will lead to allot of people leaving fw and low sec ccp did the change anyway and allot of people are leavingleft fw and low sec just saying btw are you sure your friends are still in the militia and havent left yet   you dont work any harder to do fw missions after this change you just dont do them because you cant decline missions that send you to places like ammamake go ahead and do a few missions there tell me about it unless you are part of a big corp that can field a large farming fleet at times when no one else is online or you can play eve full time and wait four hours between missions its just not a real viable option anymore anyway i dont think more people made fortunes in fw than pilots in high sec or null sec most just did missions so they would have ships they could blow up in pvp a very few people may have made good isk but from what i hear it required allot of work and coordination i suppose you think that should only be allowed in high sec and null sec
yes they are still in militia and i regularly buy fw lp only stuff from them they have no problems with supplying
as a miner who works in high sec and worm holes i support the upgrading of the exhumers who are attacked way too often by gankers simply because they know they can usually take out the mining vessels in quick order before they can either escape or help arrives to hinder them but its not just the miners who need an upgrade its proving now that even the industrials need upgrading takes forever to get the skills to fly ittys and such like but they havent got a tank of any sort really and suffer ganking a lot because of thisok rant over p
funny thing thats not actually how it works military vessels of any quality dont just take civilian vehicles and strap on armor  an aircraft carrier isnt just a freighter with steam catapults they are designed fundamentally differently from the keel up civilian ships are designed to be cheap military ships are designed to withstand damage and not just with a few inches of steel on the outside a miner should have a physically large hull yes but that does not in any way translate into having a lot of hull hp it translates into a ship thats built of tissue paper but has a big cargo hold 1 suicide ganking is supposed to be possible its an intended game mechanic 2 youre fitting your iteron wrong mine has had multiple suicide gank attempts and never gotten below like 75 armor admittedly most gankers know how to kill hulks and tailor their gank ships to break even a good tank but that is definitely not true of most other civilian ships
that is a really good point herschel that i had not considered i was honestly comparing it to that of an orca cause when i looked at the orcas stats it made sense to me that it has such a high structural hp if only for the reason that it would take lazers a long time to melt down all that structure required for such a large ship to keep out the rigors of space and since most of that hull is required for cargo bays even longer to burn through it to get down to the vital organs of such a vessel that was my thought on the matter a military vessel of equal size would by necessity have a small cargo hold and much more vital organs but the same structural considerations considering how much armor you need to strap to the outsides of iti probably dont make any sense i read the forums more than i get to play the game haha due to real life getting in the way 1 for getting to read the forums at work though1st edit fixed spelling2nd edit explained first edit doh
signature radius is already sent to your client to determine lock time so why not have it viewable
correct size column is pointless as currently implemented all frigatesdestroyers are the same size all cruisersbattlecruisers are the same size all battleships etc i filed a bug report concerning the fact that size has no relationship to signature the response indicated that it is working as intendedthis feature request is supported
it wouldnt bei thought the way that i build my post made it clear that i was sarcastic pand what sense does it make to support something thats op itll just get nerfed later anyways
yeah this would be nice
excellent suggestion
great little feature that could save so much hassle and hair
someone proposed a similar idea where all missiles would retarget if their target was destroyed while the missiles were enroute now it seems there are a few things that can go wrong with that fcs calling for a missile salvo on a target they are about to alpha so the missiles may veer off and strike something else alphaing it without warningmy modification of the ideafof missiles are meant to acquire and launch at targets with a minimum of pilot input currently missiles suffer the travel time problem where the target is occasionally dead with missiles still in space in flight to the targetwhat if fof missiles retargeted and finished their flight towards another target assuming 1the missiles still have enough flight time left and 2the target had triggered an fof launchi believe you have to be fired upon for fof missiles to launch at the targetit is my current understanding that fof missiles as they stand now are useful for overcoming jamming and have drawbacks from normal missiles which compensate for that advantage to keep this from simply being a missile buff it might be necessary to put a new skill into the game to control it say friend or foe missile specialization that gives fof missiles a 20 chance per level to retarget
missiles never miss this is how flight time is balance with other weapon types not supported
1 it impedes them from learning the game by pushing back their skill training rate since theres gaps in it fyi some skills r a requirement to use certain ships and mods did u know that2 checking in once in a while is not the problem cause i never said anything about pushing the queue past 24 hours did i no i didnt i merely supported nonexploiting autoinjection which still cant be commanded to be done without gasp logging in zomg its all clear now i hope3 tell that to drake hes the slow one who cant comprehend that no one can afk forever even with this improvement4 it doesnt matter if injection took a nanosecond cause once again u cant be away from that comp on a real life issue to actually inject step a before step b step b takes 2 seconds step a is the variable put 2 and 2 togetherfyi u still have to log in every 24 hours to update the queue even with autoinjections and that hardly qualifies as afking the damn thing to deathand its not your problem were asking for this change for a game either all were asking for is convenience for a game yet ure the one whining about itand that just proves your ignorance again theres no autopurchasing of skills or autolvling up in wow failr u paying for my subscription no then ill do what i want to do and take eve in moderation if u have a problem with that well thats not my problem u cant stop whining about it
im in favour of both free injection of skillshey if you want to spend money on a skill you cant use be my guest and a removal of the training queue length cap skills are too fundamental to the game to force us to screw around with them  if i have a paid account i should be able to train whatever i want whether i poke my head in every day or not
contrary to what i stated in my original post it appears the topic isnt as self explanatory as i thought it would beill post exactly what i meant so people dont need to guess at itsay im training medium projectile turret 5 actually i am training it atm and i want to train medium autocannon specialization right after its finished assuming i have the other prereqs motion prediction 4 and small autocannon spec 4 at the moment the only way to do this would be to be logged on at the exact time when medium projectile turret 5 finishes which can be a problem if it happens to finish in the middle of the night or while youre otherwise unable to access a computer what im proposing is to be able to add skillbooks to the skill queue the same way you add injected skills to the queue and when the queue reaches the skillbook it will just start training assuming the skillbook would be usable in those circumstances otherwise skip the skill and anything following it that happened to need it as prerequisites while this sounds stupid why not just train motion prediction to 5 or something while im asleep well thats a possibility and i do it when i can but for things like making alts in the shortest span of time possible to save training time you want the skills to be trained on the spot and as optimized as possible regardless its a minor issue and nothing for ccp to worry about if it cant be implemented with about 510 minutes worth of coding when more important issues and fixes are on the agenda
i dont get what the problem isother than my proposed idea which again as i said was passed and carried up to ccp you get a full on 24 hours to put that skill inan entire day to log on take 3 minutes to grab your skill book and figure out what you need to do nextthe only problem is you get locked out due to the prereqs rule hence my proposed idea to resolve thatonly other way around this is to pick a generic skill to train wait for your current one to finish then switch it backautomation is going to result in severe abuse and afking that alot of us will not likewhile hersch has a valid point free injection of skills is too much freedom and removes the risk from transporting valuable books so your pirates are going to be screaming about thatcourse i wouldnt care much either way as its a benefit thank you 00 marketswhen it gets right down to it imho my idea is the most balanced and thought out solution to this conundrumany other way is begging to be called an exploit think ghost training
as much as things that are easier are nice i honestly think the 24 hour skill queue is as far as ccp should go in automating skill training i dont think it is really too much of an issue to simply add another skill after the prerequisites finish and then inject that new skill the next time you log oni deal with it this way over my main and alts just fine
good point i also would imagine it only activates when warp selected
yes please
please and thank you ccp
the whole market system needs an overhaul i never said this would be easy as for a solution to the problem for the whole market keep it the way it is then add corporate  alliance store fronts this gives people the ability to show off the goods im not talking cutsie stores i mean something maybe depending on size need  social skills costs a monthly rental fee i also can see this being a nightmare server wise next i do agree with adding a negative effect as well as to what depends on the ship make it something relevant to the survival of the ship i dont want to see an abbadon with a shield recharge negative effect t3 has its own vision and works well to a pointthere are more important things out there than this idea fix destroyers really ccp for the love of all things holy fix them  fixing the pos system  go go dead horse   one of my personal favorites fixing it so t3 can switch subsystems in a ship maintenance arraybarkeep 2 shots of the strongest guttrot
oh agreed t3 is the model to go for here i dont think t3 was implemented quite right but its a far more coherent approach than ops
i like this idea supportedi played star wars galaxies in the beginning and they had a very phantastic production systemi was able to build weapons or whatever with completely different stats and it was always the sameweaponname it hereso everyone was able to choose the xyzsniper with the stats that fits his specific needsin eve we only have all the same standard hulls boring as hellit would make more fun if eg a rokh can be modified altering stats during production or inventionusing rigging modules is not the samethis would boost the invention to 10000 from the current situationif you want to have a uberrokh you have to pay uberpricesif you want a cheap rokh you get a less tanked rokh or a rusty one if you want a rokh for mining then well here you have some altered stats for thishowever balancing the stats will become a very important thing in the gamein which way this can be exactly done is very complex discussion becauseadding features to a ship which normally doesnt has this featureremoving features from a ship to get room for new features or to make other features much higherand so on and pvp can make more fun because you are never sure is this a altered ship or notif yes which stats was altered added removed this makes ship scanner really worth her slotproducing ships with this posibillities will make a lot of more funforgive my bad english  
it would be considerably more reasonable to make highsec missioning less profitable thus making 00 ratting a more attractive choice
iUFFFDd rather have anomaly rats having belt rats bounty
its time that we as paying customers either get compensated for ccps lack of ability in fixing the bugs they create with each patch and game time lost from dying nodes due impart from the systems inability tohandle the traffic in gameeveryday altough the system says trabquility is up and running players are getting messages that they are in que to enter game ie you are number 11 yet seconds later 2000 more players have entered and you move to number 6and again exceeding to the demands of players more and more eye candy is added to game making the frame rate drop in missions when the blob of npcs show up to what point do the condencending ass kissers in this game stop catering to thier childish whims and fancies and actually assit ccp in making this the great game it was and still can be there are a great many people in this game with the ability and knowledge to do so yet they are hell bent on sniping people who bring honest concerns to the attention of others the daily quips in forums stop complaining and leave the game followed by can i have your stuffsgreat retorts and to a point many have done just thatleft the game many more will do so can ccp afford to keep losing its clientell because  they dont get answers from ccp but instead are victims of ridicule by fellow players i admit i have seen the ridiculous on both sides  and so far niether have helped improve the gameits not a bad thing to want more content in a game to keep it interesting but if in the process of getting itsomething else is sacrificed as far as functionality what have you gained examples a pos owner anchores a ship maintenance array only to find out that everyone in corp can use it but the guy who ancored ityou go dock up for the night and as a good capsuleer you repair all systems on ship call it a night next day you log on undock going to do that mission or mine to find out everything on your ship shows online but it isnt and you have to redock or its all offline once you undock youve sweated out going into a wh youve lived there for a few weeks  mined the heck out of it you sit hoping that youll get a new grav site respawn you log in and lo and behold its happened youve scanned out a new grav site preparing to mine it you hop in your ship nothing works you suspect a crash comming head back to pos and boom the node dies  no worries your confident alls okwhen it comes back up you have to rescan all sigs as they have changed and then you find out the respawn went with the node its no longer there i love playing eve have for yearsstop and think if the smallest most unimportant things in this game cant be fixed how can it move forward with new content and other than the csms how come ccp fails to give voice to its loyal customersadress the issues that have plagued the game or admit that its not possible to maintain the game at its current lvlor is there an alterior motive behind it all new console games in the works like the much touted dust with all its endless possibilities that are no longer available to eve players for interactionfix the fixsnipe away will
uh whateven when im in queue ive never actually waited more than 5 minutes except dt queues which can sometimes be annoying but understandablebad fps in missions are you even serious set details to low and upgrade your typewriter pthe undockissue sounds odd is this a repeating problemive had problems with some mods after largescale fights but nothing ive been unable to handle 
holy wall of text batmanalso pick any 2 of 3can i have your stuffbecause of falconi have 17 mill can i help
i could live with that but my concern is idiotproofing it for newbies i dont want to see people quitting the game because they cant find the button or anything stupid like that
the idea of forcing supercaps to remain in space would be cool ship yards would then exist and woudl become very prized targets only thing is this is a game and we have rlim a super cap pilot i have my ship which i bought after a long time cool now i have a life so i decide to go on vacation jobs little demanding its finals week what have you and you cant play eve for an extended amount of time now what do you propose happens to my ship it has to stay in space able to be blown away and dont give me the its the responsibilities of the cap pilot blah blah blah this is a game rl always comes first also i personally would not trust anyone else to fly it personally too expensive and also like ai they might be a total nub at flyign it and thus get it blown uppersonally i dont like the idea of having to creat a garage alt either but when you think about it in this sandbox game its very viable you say its disapeared i say i put a cloak in the high slot in that case the ship is invincible sinc eits cloaked in a ss
i wouldnt go in the cave im painting
oh i understand real life and completely agree i have a toddler and run several conventions in different cities each year plus a wife a job etcas one possible option though  you just answered your own questioncreate a deep safespot put a cloak in a high slot and turn it on go on vacationccp would have to change the game slightly that mods which were on when shutdown came were also on when the system came back up but that wouldnt be too bad to do when i log out in my carrier the shield damage i took before logging out isnt repaired even if it is the next day so it is clearly possible to keep some settingsthe game would without question require some tweaking if such a change were to go through desyncs etc would need to be addressed folks discoing during a fleet battle in a titan etc lots of issues and it would not be simple quick or easythere would be as you say some aspects that would be kind of cool though
why are you in my cave oo
um i think i already started this discussionnot that im a csm or the like so ill just link my thread
theres a difference between a post youve made to suggest issues for the csm to discuss and a thread posted by the chairman used to put together the agenda
mrs trzzbk attended so far at only 1 csm meeting some alt csms only showed up at the first meeting and the last csm meeting there were only 7 csm available including the available altscsm4 should ask ccp to have mrs trzzbk removed from csm and have it replaced by the 1st alt csm before the csm trip to icelanda big shame to serenity steele and meissa being alt csms for not showing up at csm meetings as they both were former csms i guess being an alt csm is not good enough for them anymore you both only attended to the first csm meetingx
dear csm and outspoken eve citizensi am currently working on an explorer ships idea thats still in development and research such as providing work tables and graphs and researching into how stuff is done like finding out one new activity of the suggestion threatened another existing one and the idea has to be rethought to fix that this all takes time and currently the idea as old as long as its been around of the fourm is still nowhere near donethere have been third parties out of my control last csm term that tried to get my idea promoted to be voted on and i had to shoot it down myself and had to prevent the idea from being voted on at the time as it was very incomplete and there has been 3 major overhauls of the idea since thenso i am requesting that if anyone aside from myself that is trying to suggest my ships and profession revamp idea to be brought to the csm table to be shot down until i am fully ready to publish the ideaby then it will hopefully be in a presentable manner with all bases covered the idea is very extensive and far reaching effects that need to fully researched to predict possible conflict of fragile activities once identified generate solutions to relive or prevent breaking of something already existing and not planned on being replaced by the ideafor those of you who are getting tired of waiting on me please help out by any means by pointing out possible market threats breaking mechanics suggestions critizisms and commentsthank younova fox novafox shipyards
after an extensive threadnaught in ships and modules me and liang came up with the following proposal for the rebalancing of railguns and the caldari railboats in conjuction with that change this proposal amounts to15 to railguns dmg modifierreduce spike optimal bonus to 7010 to caldari railboats pgso they are up to par with gallente ones as far as fitting requirementsthe thread where arguments and counter arguments were flung at each other is here please ignore the obvious trolls that try to derail italso so that the csm can use it and after being proposed there are graphs and a rounding up of all the arguments that have gone back and forth herethe railgun issue has been put to vote by csm and was dropped because they did not have a specific proposal therefore i put one up with numbers data and logical justification also it has more support and views than most of the many other issuesfinally it affects more than 50 of the eve populace and half the issues concerning gallente and caldari are tied to underperforming weapon systems especially hybrids it is of concern to both pvp and pve pilots so i think it is of interest for a lot of peopleps i have no proposal for blasters yet my data are very scant on them if anyone wants to do a separate thread about them be my guest
because i naturally forgot to support my own idea duh
got to back this one up its utterly sad that arty got such a huge bonus but rails still utterly suck especially when hybrid ammo is supposed to be soooooooooo powerful according to lore
if you could id like to see a graph of the current state of the long range weapons in the game and then what this change would do to itmy one concern with basing all these arguments on caldari snipers is how gallente ones will turn out i dont think that 15 is so extreme that itll break balance but id still like that train of thought sorted out before i support it
yes since rails are no longer the sniping platform of choice both changes make them viable
so heres the stats on how the assorted t2 turrets compare the dps number is not actual dps its simply multiplierrof since all other dps mods are basically the same all numbers are before any skills or ship bonuses dpsoptimalfallofftracking425mm rail 0345 57624 00096tachyon beam 0432 52820 001391400mm arty 0319 4835 0009250mm rail 0518 28812 0023heavy beam 06 248 0033720mm arty 0478 24175 0022150mm rail 0776 1446 007medium beam 09 124 01280mm arty 0717 12875 0066if any longrange turret needs a buff its arty they do noticeably less damage than rails track a shade worse and their ranges dont match up until about one falloff out rails do less raw dps than beams but their range is significantly better this doesnt seem like it cries out for a flat 15 damage boost  that would give them almost the same dps as beams with significantly better range i know amarr is fotm and all but that doesnt mean you need to make other stuff better instead regarding the pg issue which ships are you referring to the rokh can fit 8x425 ii and a mwd ii with one t1 rcunot exactly onerous given its a sniper boat with five lows and nobody actually cares about any of the other caldari rail boats
anything that makes the craptastic rails betterdude those s are those pre or post dominion ive never seen rails instapopping ships like the big a arty doedit to be honest id forgo a damage bonus to get more tracking on the rails

supporting  but i have accepted the fate fo gallente pilots they are condemned for constant nerfs into oblivion ccp wont do squacinstead expect another indirect nerf soonthe last post i have read wrritten by ccp in that matter was i know this topic is about rails  but it shows their attitiude
ya whatever blasters rocks its true but if a fcking arty boat can volley you to death with pretty good tracking from 150km away your 10km range blasters arent worth sht

replace kinetic missile bonus with rof or damage bonusit is absolutely unfair it means dps boost because you can shoot in weak resist points em for shields or exp for armorlast minmatar ammo change have boosted their weapon now they can vary damage type more effectively hybrids and lasers can notps example imagine you know your pvp opponent ship type what will you tank against hybrid ship  thrm kinagainst laser ship  em thrmagainst projectile ship  i do not know now they can everythingagainst raven  i do not know  it can any damage type with the same effectiveness
this is insane in the membranemissiles are just fine in balance if anything need change its rail and beam
no dude your wrongwhats absolutelly unfair  i would choose the word imbalanced  is thatmini get 33 more dps at level 5 hull trainingamarr get 33 more dps at level 5 hull traininggal get 25 more dps  blasters  and 50 more dps  drones  at level 5 hull trainingcaldari get 8 more dps at level 5 hull trainingand as has been repeated ad infinituum in this thread allready  blaster and lasers start with far more dps than missiles and projectile to make up for there inability to target resist holes
wtf gallente are getting shafted too by your numbers and fixed that for ya
supporting
guys i think the real point here is caldari missile boats are only doing 1 damage types where as turrets get to do 24 damage types and without the bonus to all missiles then the versatility of using missiles is lost and yes overall missiles are not super great pvp weapons to begin withand yeah drones only do 1 damage type and yeah only the gallente and minmatar drones are really worth it but drones dont take up slots and drone ships are pretty versatile and they can fit turrets too sooo yeahanyways yeah im all for the bonus getting changed to all missile types i see no reason come caldari ships already have this some amarr too and it doesnt break the gameyeah you can run around with scourge missiles and just stfu and life will go on but i really think it would make more sense to get rid of the kinetic only bonus in favor of just 5 missile damage per level overall
a bit of patience wont work you need to make a noise listen to the people of lowsecand not faction war that is almost irrelevent to the people who live in lowsec it is an entirely different eventwhat we are talking about there are the criminals outlaws gangs and warlords who live here the anti pirates and bounty hunters who stalk there and lowsec industrials the smugglers black market dealers teh adventurous from hisec wanting a little action miners willing to risk the danger or willing to pay the criminals to be left alonelowsec should be a dynamic environment dark and dangerous but with its own politics and workingsccp listen that is the lowsec we want
im not even a pirate and i know lowsec needs love and to be honest i must say i love all of these suggestionsi really hope that expansion outlaw is planned
supported for awesome ideas
not a pirate but know a few and read their blogs etc and as a highsecnullsec dweller outlaws and lowsec need some lovebut i also thing their should be some difference between 0401 right now their just numbers theirs no actual difference that i can tell something needs to make that changeso lowsec sovereignty of sorts well not sovereignty but im sure we can come up with an underworld crime syndicate type name edit what i find most hysterical about lowsec is lowsec mining  epic fail its literally useless why ever ever ever ever risk lowsec mining or even ninja mining it the ores worth less than every other highsec orehow about drug running missions in lowsec kinda like courier missions that pay better but between lowsec areas and always to do with drugs and carry drugs or manufacturing drugs in lowsec 100 lowsec on both sides designed for pirates and cloaky haulers etc
proposala button or dropdown menu selection that reconnects to drones lost on either a warpout or a disconnectconditions edit 20100204 approx 1845 added this section1 the option is available if the player warps away from the drones for any reason2 the drones are still considered active thus more drones cannot be deployed unless the active drones are recovered or abandoned3 due to signal decay the drones are effectively abandoned if they are not recovered within 10 minutes4 jumping systems or docking automatically abandons the drones5 it is not possible to reconnect to abandoned dronesreasoningive recently gotten into t2 drones and in just a week of using them ive lost three sets in missions when i had a network disconnect even in a cruiser i dont have enough time to reach them before the mission rats kill them off the loss is frustrating when its a 25 mil set of hammerhead iis i think a reconnect button would give us a chance to at least recover some of them before they get popped as previous threads have stated this mimics the way we can reconnect to lost probes so while i wont assume that the actual programming will be simple i see the fix as one that makes logical sensenote i hunted through previous posts on this topic and found several inactive threads but reading through them seemed to suggest that they had general community support and that this was something that could warrant the csms attention apologies if this has gone up the chain before and been rejected
1 i wunder y nobudy els sujested thiz alredee2 rats need to stop shooting abandoned drones sure it could easily be exploited by a competent mission runner but it would also save a lot of grief on dcs3 probes got a recovery button why cant we
i definitely support this
would love thatsigned
i secondedededededed the motion
i 200 support thisi brought my t3 ship out to wh space in my covert ops fit to be on the safe side because i assumed u could change them at a pos needless to say i had to cart all the way back to empire just to change the subsystems there needs to be a way to change them badly
i support this one
i would link them in the sense that every unit in all the constellation must be in one of some defined states in order to enter reinforcement mode this means that attacker is not going to lose the system if only some of the sbus are down but only if they all down everywhere or if the battles in every system are won or lost and then the attacker has the possibility to save his achievements for the next time if he manage to put some new sbus online in the next 12 hours
absolutely brilliant would have a huge impact on the current problemrax
while i dont think that it would solve the problem because mobility of bs fleet is too high anyway compared to the size of the battlefield this is a very simple proposal that sould be very easy and fast to implement
as i get older in the game i found that my and other corp mates clone costs are getting fairly high this seems okay when flying something big but when flying cheap frigs or cruisers my pod cost without any implants is more than the loss from the shipi propose a change to the current clone costs to make it level out as you get oldercurrent costs
i support my own idea after ive patiently waited for 5 mins
i franga from the same corporation and alliance as matting support this ideahowever i wish it known that even if i wasnt in the same corporation and alliance as matting i would still support this ideaedit i franga from the same corporation and alliance as matting forgot to click the support button when posting
smooth post as for the idea in the op it might be good idea with some alterations the cost should be somewhat larger at the high end and the increase shouldnt be so sudden in the low sp range but i agree that the increase in clone cost seems a bit too steep it isnt cripling but being an old character shouldt mean your frigatecruiser roams keep getting financially significantly more demanding although the actual equipment you use doesnt change in any way the loss should be based on the hardware you use not your sp countas for reducing the isk sink i admit that might be an issue i would still prefer that the sink be relocated away from the actual clone loss to other areas dare i mention slightly reduced insurance payment to balance it since you lose just the ship much more often than your pod the decrease in payment percentages wouldnt need to be significant i dont really care how it is balanced though
not supportedthe argument that your pod costs more to replace than your ship at higher skill point levels is disingenuous you specifically mention t1 frigatecruiser roams so lets look at that specificallycurrently the most expensive minmatar frigate on the regional market where i am is the rifter weighing in at 160000 isk the most expensive cruiser is the rupture at 49 milliona full set of 2 attribute implants which are lets be honest pretty cheap as implants go will run you about 12 million isk theyre averaging about 25 million isk each where i am thats 25 times as much as the rupture and about 78 times as expensive than the rifter even with fittings unless youre including rigs andor officer mods youd have a hard time hitting 12 million with the rifter though you could probably exceed it with the rupture and lets be honest if youre fitting officer mods your clone is really the least of your expensesadditionally your suggested scale would reduce the isk sink for older characters by close to 90 at the 100 million skill point mark while increasing the cost at the 5 million mark by nearly 1000 so you move the isk sink away from the area its really needed tht being precisely those older characters who generally have the most liquid assets and place it squarely on the people least able to to keep up with it
strongly opposedthis harms new players who have few paths to make the isk for clones and rewards well established character that have many paths to make the isk for clones
saying its disingenuous is really rude and hurtful it also misses the point my clones cost 20mil a pop clean using your idea of plugging it with 2s means it now costs 32mil what the op is suggesting is that having a 32mil clone to fly a 35mil rifter discourages him from roaming more in nullsec where the chance of being podded is far far higherlets say that you want to go out and have some cheap fun because you dont have the time to sit and pour over market figures and trade or run missions and grind or whatever other time sink to make money and youve got 5 x 5mil rifters fit so 25mil of hardware youre going to nullsec and get podded at least 3 of those times and lose the rifter all 5 timesthats 25mil hardware youve lost but 66mil worth of clones the night has cost you 89mil for 5 cheap ships and all i wanted to do was have a go at a few ceptors and then die to the eventual blob at a gate as a rule im not a big fan of throwing away nearly 90mil just because i feel like soloing and that prohibits me from going to nullsec something ccp would like to see more ofbut remember were all flying around in officer fitted ruptures were sinking enough isk anyway seriously though have a look at the graphs again and look at the ops arguments there isnt a huge amount of difference sp effectiveness wise between a 2030mil player and a 70100mil sp playergoing back to your rifterclone idea but without the 2s it costs the lower sp player maybe 26mil 5 x rifter 3 x 100k clone the higher sp player around 80 5 x rifer 3 x 20mil isk clone srsly 55mil isk difference
a new player has to raise 40k for a clone if that thats harmful
i thought that was nicer than saying that if you cant save your pod by the time you have 20 million skillpoints youre an idiot lesser of two evils my good man lesser of two evilseve is a game of choice and consequence if you have enough skill points that your clone is a cost consideration and i mean a real one not a lolcost then you should have been playing the game long enough to accurately evaluate the real costs of the activities you are about to undertake and make your choices appropriately you want the choice without the potential consequences and that is something i will never support
40k your throwing a fit over 40kdude i make that in 2 minutes and your throwing a fit over 40knot supporting bloody hell of all the stupid reasons
we know how to save our pods thank you very much but in 00 there are aoe warp scramblers that you cant escape and even if you escape you have a very risky road ahead to get to your new ship if your opponent wants you podded you will be podded dying isnt the issue it is that the minimum cost of podding gets increased too much this reduces your options you have as a player based just on your sp countyou talk about consequenses for my choices but my only alternatives are to live with increased costs never set foot in 00 or stop training my characters why would you want to force those choices on people how would allowing old characters to have low cost pvp fun be a bad thing for the game to achieve this they will have to fly weaker ships and dont have any advantages over newer players flying the same ships why would you want to exclude them from having low cost fun in cheap ships because of the amount of sp they have it is the exact same choice a newer player can take so should we remove the option from them too since it is just a way to avoid potential consequensesas you can see what we ask is for the same options to remain open to us as older characters as we had as newbs the numbers in the op are a bit silly but why is the idea that the cost level should be decided by the toolsitems you use instead your age bad if anything it would actually give you the option to be casual about your losses if you choose to limit yourself in the equipment you use
poor excusei live in 00 with said risks and know all to well what happens out herethe costs are justified due to the sheer abilities you would have at that kind of sp countthat and you can make that isk very easily out hereyou would know that if you did live out hereotherwise your not doing it right  o phell ive made more isk out here in 00 than i would in high sec that says something
its pretty easy to live and make isk in 00 and to generally be a carebearratter and avoid getting podded the point is if youre actually pvping in 00 as a higher sp character taking risksjumping into gate camps and bubbles  not just carebearing the frequent poddingupgrading clones can end up costing too much for it to be worth it for some people if i owned a 90 mil sp plus character and i wanted to fly t1 frigs in 00 or for some reason didnt have enough isk to keep updating 2030mil isk clones i would probably just end up making a new characteralt to fly frigs with
excellent job on not reading the op well done
please explain how i get my pod away from a hic or warp bubble and again missing the point we dont mind losing our pod we mind paying 2030mil per loss
go talk to goonswarm and pl and all those other bigshots and ask them how they do itthey will all tell you the same thing they go rat mine build just like everyone elseyou pvp you dont make money thats your problem not mineyou wana get down and dirty about cost what about the ship the mods the insuranceclones are nothing to thatyou have no business pvping if you cant afford to replace your clone to begin with
im just using the same criteria to evaluate the ideathe current medical clone cost as all the new ideas we have here the fact that this was implemented a long time ago doesnt make it any better i agree in that you can make the isk relatively easily but that is besides the point to a degree there should be increased cost to a point but i think it should be either capped there or stop the rediculously high rate of increase the point is while the system does allow you to have increased ability taking advantage of it is always tied to different kind of items you have the same exact ability in those cheap ships as a guy whose clone cost pittance compared to yours if you want to utilize your increased ability you will need to utilize expensive gearshipsimplants the loss and cost of them should be the primary risk associated with death a cap on the cost also future proofs the system now we have a decent amount of people well over 100 mil and eve shows no signs of dying soon for them its 30 mil isk per podding now and it will only get worse without any real benefit to the game or is there some reason to believe people will like grinding money more when they get so much sp not to mention not everyone is rich and would like an option to keep the cost of losses to a minimumwhat will things look 5 years from now when that is what a large portion of the players could have to pay and it is double to triple that to the most skilled the real problem i have with it and i know im repeating what i already said here is that there is no good way to mitigatereduce this cost you are forced to pay it as a penalty for training your character too long a minimum of 30 65 or 90 mil loss for flying a t1 frigate with no advantages over younger pilots just because you kept training a single character how does this make sense in any wayill repeat again that what the op proposed is just too little but what reason is there to keep raising the clone cost indefinitely why not a system where it is capped for example 30 mil isk at 120 mil sp mark after that your clone can hold infinite amount of sp and that is it no more upgrading your clone just buying a new one after being podded if you feel it is just too little for you you will have the option to increase the risk and cost of death as high as you want but are not forced to do that by an unavoidable game mechanic that punishes having a high sp character just because it was one of the earlier mechanics and isk sinks ccp thought of doesnt mean it isnt open to review
drake is an expert and well placed to comment on pvp
the way i see it someone who has played that long will not have an issue when it comes to making isk and will be smart enough to gauge the risks and not be so gutsywith time comes experience and experience is the thing that allows you to succeed with practiceso yes i tend to agree its a bit of a sour taste but then i dont take risks to the point of ended up upside down financially eitherdo i look like i give a  what you think when it comes to killboardsyay you saw ive been podded what twice in my entire time ive played this gamegee lost some ships over the lifespan of playing eve gee golly wizzwhat does that mean means im cautious careful obviously im industrykilled a few as wellgood for you gold star for you now go away and let the grown ups talkoh yes battleclicic is the holy grail and authority on anyones pvp skill yay

call me a carebear a mission runner a loser i do not care i love missions i love not getting killed i love iski once said that if it werent for missions and highsec i wouldnt play this game its still trueevery mmo i play its for the missionsim coming up to be able to fly a nighthawk and i discover that i cant get a level 5 agent in highsec it kinda makes me want to move on from eve if ive exhausted the mission route and theres too much risk involvedcan we have level 5s in highsec pleaseyours uber carebearyes this is an alt
heres where you need to go
you can get lvl5s in highsec it just takes some iterations of ask for missiondecline but most of them will be in lowsec and many of them will be vs the other factionsand if you hope to do your lvl5s solo in a nighthawk it will be either a quick death hello heavy neut towers or take you ages lvl5 are for groups of people
thanks for the adviceits the having to request from losec that bugs me can get easily snagged outside the station while in 200m isk of implantsas for soloing my corpies regularly solo lvl5s in a nighthawk but sometimes need help with the carrier passive tank and missiles ftw vs heavy neut
1 fly covops2 make insta undock spots 500km suggestedhelp from a carrier is not soloing further more the dps of a that highly tanked nighthawk is just embarrasing doing lvl5s with 45 people is much more funwith 10 people it kind of gets too easy as you just obliterate the ratsalso missioning in lowsec isnt all that difficult with some planning ahead and a scout or two
not supported
so join a corp that works to secure an area of lowsec from gankers so that you can run missions in relative safetyor you could sulk and threaten to quit the game because you dont understand isk vs risk i guess

correct me if wrong but arent lvl 4s still the better option for making isk

if someone shot my interceptor with an ammar dread and missed can i actually have him miss instead of having a beam 5 times the size of my ceptor burning my ship for 10 secondsi support everything you said and definitly support this one  the second thing when i shoot a titan with barrage of 8 missiles all missiles do not just go and all hit the same window i know that we are trying to make a hole in the ship but when a 100 bs launch 8 missiles each and all 800 missiles start hitting the same window it looks wiredthis may be one should be one of the easiest changes for them to make and i dont get why they havent done it yet let the clients graphics process pick a random impact point for every shotmissle on the ship so that all fire isnt always hitting the exact same spot it looks fake and breaks immersion
i agree with this possibly more than any other threaddifferntiating impact points on target and self is needed asapactually showing shots that miss as missed or glanced is really a needed changeits just nuts that these havent been fixeddone yetability to disable visibility of remote self effects sounds good if it does in fact allow for large fleets to reduce some lag maybe even enable a forced option that ccp can force this if grid goes over x amount of people
i have been looking at the difference cost and rarety of these items and i believe there needs to be a fix to 1 of the items to better fit it in the oreitems list the orestrip miner gives a bonus to mining amount and distance making it worth what it sells for yet the oreice harvester only gives a 2km distance bonus this makes the item basically worthless since all you would need is a mining laser field enhancement link to increase the distance and no one is going to pay 200m to just increase the distance 2km especially when they can buy a mining laser field enhancement link for 1m fixing this would give a bonus to the mining amount as well as distance putting it in line with the other oreitems and also making it worth buying i am only suggesting this because the modulated strip miner iis mining amount is 360m3 the orestrip miners is 540m3 and the distance increase yet the ice harvester iis mining amount is 1000m3 and a distance of 10km while the oreice harvesters is only an increase of 2km no mining increase making it worthless and not worth 200m thanks to the mining laser field enhancement link it is an easy fix and it would again put it in line witht he rest of the oreitems making it worth the price and making it sellplease fill free to either reply with fix or no fix may help eve decide on it being fixed or not thanks
umm you seem to hvae missed something dudestrip miner 1  540m3 ore strip miner  540m3 modulated strip miner ii is 360  crystal bonusore mining tools are the same amount as t1 but with range bonus which i agree is useless in ice harvesting as who the hell ever moves to a different ice block when ice mining lolpersonally i think that the ores should both be bumped to be  t1 but  t2 with t2 crystalsso  rerequest this proposal with say ore harvester at 800m3and ore ice harvester with cycle time of say 525sthat way t2 beats them but requires the skills for it but if youve got the cash you can still get a good bonus from the expensive ore devices just not quite as good as skilling up for t2
true with crystals it bumps the amount but if these items are going to be very hard to get and very expensive then an increase in mining amount as well as the distance should be altered on all of them to better fit them in the game and actually make the worth as much as people are trying to get for them i mean these items are very rare and very expensive make them worth it then
holy wall of text batmanso you want the oreice harvester to have an increased yield and distance making it worth the costok 2 questions1 ice comes in 1000 m3 chunks no more no less the smallest increment up would be 2000 m3 you want these to have double the yield of a regular ice harvester2 mining distance just how far from the nonpopable glaciers do you need to be the point of the distance increase on a strip miner is to not have to move your barge so much as the roids pop the ice cubes dont last time i checked when you mine ice you find a spot and you can sit there until downtime without moving what would be the benefit to an increased mining distancefill in some blanks here and convince us why either of those are betterworth it
you lost me here the point isnt to make something fit with what people think they should be worth its to improve something within the game mechanics not the market pvp sandboxid go along with a cycle time decrease like lord helghast suggested but otherwise to adjust an items stats to make it fit into the marketnot supported
so do you theyre called javelins and let your torps hit at 45km if youre gonna let the mega use null in your above example you should have the raven use javelin aswell and were back where we startederm yes they doi do think caldari suck but its not because of these reasons 1 close range missile systems are fine but the close range caldari ships pretty much have something else theyre lacking for sr hacs theyre slow for rr bs gangs 34 races are perfect for armour tank while the last can make do as it while only 24 can shield tank well and the others simply cant pull it off therefore rr bs gangs always rely on armour where caldari can just barely make do before you mention it yes the drake can be fitted to be very effective at close range but even that roughly matches the other racial bcs even if you do manage to get a pure minmatarcaldari gang tackle is an issue2 for long range rails simply dont put out enough dps to be as effective as other races and when sniping you generally need to be able to kill a target quick before he has time to realize hes being targeted and warp out so missiles dont work for 2 reasons 1 if you shoot the primary it will be deadwarped out before you hit and 2 if you shoot the secondary they get an advance warning that theyll soon be primary and can warp out before all the turret bs that really can kill him before he can warp locksso what can be done well for close range xl shield extenders to match the 1600mm plates would free up slots for tackle for long range the only thing i can really see working is to greatly reduce flight time but in return boost velocity so that range stays about the same that way missiles will be able to deliver the quick damage that is required for that gang type and the thing making them different would instead be the tracking system caldari cant really change their chance of hitting or how much damage they do but they can do damage to targets that turret ships of their class cant track at all in return if the turret ship maneuvers properly it can get in a position where it does full damage against that moving target while the missile ship still get a reduction
have you lost your marbles
if missiles get a tracking enhancer i want a missile tracking disruptor on a medium slot
that
thats fine as long as we also get a high slot turret hardpointed  point defence system that can shoot railgun charges  projectiles and lasers outof the air before they hit my ship
oh you mean those lol useless defenders when did you see the last person that fitted defenders and survived
lol okay if you really want it well grant you that useless piece of crapor better yet just remove defender missiles entirely no one uses them anyway
sure go for it
bring it back kill the pig cut its throat
do you guys play any other pc games as i do and as i made my comp good enough to run those eve was no problem high all the waybut i like my games to look good the last time i had an issue was when i played riven and then myst 3 exile came out i tried the demo but is was so slow i decided not to get the game until my computer could run it at a sufficient quality lvlim sure you dont need that good a comp for eve especially with prices nowadays
alas after a week or so this thread has not moved on at all its varying between complaints about procedure the original post does not contain a proposal and disagreement on principle i say that it is logical that you have to sacrifice a character when you buy a supercapital shipall of which seems somewhat to be missing the point of this forum and to my mind oversteps the remit of the csm  they are here as representatives not judges i would suggest that somebody starts a new thread with a proposal we can vote on and see if it gets any support say make supercapitals anchorable with a detailed description of the mechanics if it gets no support then its dead thats the way it should be not a bunch of people killing it off for their own purposesif all else fails support this thread instead
anchoring seems like a sensible suggestion to me the deployable anchorage structure even better having them disappear from the game with a parking valet alt is ridiculous for such epic scale shipsi would go much further i always found it rather odd that these super capital titan ships are so regularlyreadily destroyed eve could be made more epic by introducing an intermediate state disabled this could perhaps be like forcing a pos into reenforced mode the owning faction could have the opportunity to rescuesalvage the titan the attacking faction the opportunity to finish the job this could lead to some epic strugglesalso allowing the bumping of titans is sillyi have no personal interest in this any kind of super capital or titan is long way off for mecsm are supposed to be player representatives i find it more than a little disturbing they are trying to drown out the obvious majority opinion because it doesnt serve their own interests
im not forced to eat either  but the consequences of not doing so are a bit direthe options as they currently stand are either eat at the alt table or starve in a supercap you can do virtually nothing in making the game essentially unplayable with that character for large amounts of timethat is effectively you must have an alt or you cannot play pretty it up all you like thats what youre saying okay  lets follow your argument here youve admitted it cannot be safely parked without an alt we agree that sitting in one limits play in extreme ways to the point where most of the time all you can do is sit in the thing not play the gameyoull disagree of course because you simply dont like to admit that reality but to anyone reasonable thats you must have an alt or the game is unplayablethat is the reason for the request for the change yes without an alt the consequences you speak of mean that you log on and spend most of the evening staring at a ship in space doing nothing even ratting is pointless as you can no longer do anything with the isk i find it astonishing that you think that this is a reasonable situationyou clearly prefer the status quo for whatever reason you havent actually said why you dont like the idea of something as simple as allowing the anchoring of a ship or improving pos security instead you just spout things about consequences which arent really consequences at all if like most eve players you metagamewhen you make a list of arguments are so far from the reality of how the game you are supposed to be experienced in is played what possible other response is thereyou may believe otherwise but you have come across as dismissive and condescending from your very first post everything you have written basically came down to im not really interested in anything you have to say  i dont like your idea and im going to try and belittle it with nonsense in hopes that no one supports it if that wasnt your intent well you will notice that i am not the only one you gave that impression to
how about this for a solution its based the premise that you are able to issue a remote command to the super cap ship1 you warp to a safe spot2 you exit the ship3 you are able to execute a command from your pod to make the ship to use its jump drive to jump to a random spot in its jump range like an interstellar safe spot no cyno required here as the destination is not defined4 the ship jumps out of the star system and is obviously not scannable to steal as normal ships cant access interstellar space5 to get the ship back go back to where you left it and issue the remote command to make it jump back only the pilot that sent it off can make it return a cyno is required here as you are bringing it to a defined destinationor alternatively there could be some sort of password system required to make the ship jump back so other corp members could bring it backthis would require some kind of bookmark that was recorded on the pilots journal like a mission locationplease commence rubbishing of idea
firstly requiring people to use this forum correctly should not be an issue there is even a sticky at the topfor some reason me simply pointing this out is trolling rude condescending or whateverill stop you there have you read the csm devblog or the summarya couple of relevant quoteswhilst you are correct that we are representatives it is also pretty clear that the csm members are supposed to also filter the issuesproposals raised by the players discuss them and vote on which ones to pass to ccpwe are not judges as such more correctly we are an elected council of peers who have been tasked with filtering the proposals before they go to ccpwhat you will spot is that at no point does it require csm members to actively discuss ideas with other players i could raise proposals to the csm and then simply vote them down without having the aggravation of being flamed for daring to point out my concerns before hand on the subject of supportthis thread has been up a week and has only managed to gain seven supporters edit eight now the new thread you suggest somebody raise has been up for two days and so far has zero support not even the proposer supports it but did attempt to sling mud at me 3 or 4 timeson the subject of a bunch of people killing the proposal off for their own purposesexactly two out of nine csm reps replied to this thread with their concerns two is a bunch if the proposal is to succeed it only needs 5 of the csm to agree to it providing it gains the required level of support to get on the agenda in the first placei take my csm responsibilities seriously witness the effort i am putting in with the minutes as well as actually posting in this forum even though people might wish i wouldnt because i disagree with them  but there is a huge public relations mountain to climb due to previous csm behaviour as well as current csm attendance and the long lead time from csm approval to ccp implementation of featureshowever i will step out of the argument because nothing i can say as a member of the csm will be considered unbiased even if it isnt

yeah its lame im generally antilame so i support this or something like it i never played wow so i dont know or care how this compares to wow arenas are ok for the alliance tournament and it seems people in big alliances enjoy that why cant others do this or something similar or are we going to get some proposals that the alliance tournaments should end because they are too much like wow
the alliance tourney gives away hundreds of billions of isk worth of free ships that ccp spawns specifically for the purpose to whoever wins it i think that in that case theres nothing wrong with taking steps to ensure the integrity of the tournament environment a random 1v1 is simply not the same situation
alliance tournement have officials that check for exploits and combines  you need live peoples for that an algoritm can and will ever be gamed and exploitedyou can do that at alliance tournement because they are small events with little groups of peoples involved and lasts for a limited period at precise timeframesyou cant do that with 50000 players concurrently online you should hire 200000 peoples to check them all around the 24hrs 365dy 
this is not wow  a single player game giving lip service to some multiplayer aspectsthis is eve if you want some kind of 1v1 on demand join an alliance and ask someone for a fightthe ops idea will be horribly exploited and nonfunctional three seconds after it is releasedwhat you want a feel good killanoob or a fair 1v1 fightwhat you will get noobs who will get killed 50 times in a day then quit the game  interspersed with players in ecmneutheavy shipsyou arent going to get fair fights you will hate it there will be a nonstop crying and gnashing of teeth over it as no one will ever be satisfied with it because everyone complains a fight was not fair in some way when they die ccp will have 50000 petitions a day titled omg hax because of it an arena in eve will not work
recently ccp has been trying to cover up the larkonisgate scandal ingame his csm 3 medal was removed from his character despite larkoniss dedication to the csm many of the players proprosals were voted in by larkonis and he helped change eveonline for the greater good he was voted into the csm by the community and therefor deserves his medal unlike others who werent voted in yet were defaulted a medal because of larkonisgatenot only this but it appears ccp are trying to airbrush this whole incident from history on their wiki larkonis has been apparantly removed from the equation altogether personally i think this is poor form by ccp who gave so much to the csm and in return recieved so littlethe least that can be done to rectify this situation is the restore larkoniss name to the wiki record and give him back his ingame medal for his services
yes because it is perfectly acceptable for players to break nondisclosure agreementscontracts and get off scott free as far as being permabannedemphatic thumbs down
so you guys bum buddies or whut
this all sounds most unjust so quite probably true
yes please at least let the legacy of the great larkonis and what he tried to achieve live on in official annals which is a perfectly fine and decent english sentence
nondisclosure agreementhe didnt disclose anything therefor how did he break it yes
injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywher  the rev dr martin luther king jrsupported
oh i see his sobbing keeps you awake at night  or he is so depressed that you arent getting any cookies
larkonis is an independant bastion of strength honour and justice in an otherwise dull and bleak universe
reread my posti said ndacontracthe was not supposed to act on that information therefore he broke the ndai suggest you learn to read before you post less embarrassing
what is it with larkonis fan club that they feel the need to whitewash what he didi swear its like watching a bunch of politicians trying to define the words sexual relations all over again
yeah well doesnt mean he should be wiped from the official eve history books now does it
he signed an nda he didnt disclose anythingwhat exactly are you trying to say
a typical nda also includes a clause stating that you will not use the information for personal gain and to counter your next argument since isk can be traded for game time via plexes it does have a real world value and thus can be included in the for personal gain argument
stick to the rules if you want a shiney medal
have you actually read the csm ndaits quite clear that you havent
oh im sorry i didnt realise you also read the nda that larkonis signed ill be more careful in the future to ensure i dont make that mistakeand you cant trade isk for  how does that give it real world value and how come plex scamming is allowed because its an ingame item it has nothing to do with the real worldedit getting slightly off topic here btw
not sure about giving him his medal back but wtf removing him from the wiki eve should be proud to have the odd scandal it makes for interesting history and makes it look more like a proper democracy
whats the tldr on whatever he did
used his knowledge to buy out stuff that would get more valuable with the changes ccp was planning
the terrible irony is that it got less valuable
ouch
stop being an idiot on purpose its not helping your argumentwe get it that youre a lark fanboi and thats fine  some of us feel that our csm members should hold themselves to a higher standard of behavior which is why were disagreeing with your proposal but dont throw attitude at us when we use examples to show why youre wrong an nda is a standard legal document  ccp didnt invent them and having signed quite a few of them myself i can tell you more or less whats includedthe clause for personal gain is included to prevent you from using any information you may encounter in your activities under the agreement in a manner that would give you a tangible benefit since isk can be used to buy game time as i pointed out larks use of the information could enable him to acquire game time in a manner not available to every other player in the game and thats the key point yes you can scam plex  and anyone else in the game can try the same tactic to get free game time larks actions enabled him to be able to acquire that game time in a manner not available to everyone because it was based on knowledge not yet available to the wider player base in essence he engaged in insider trading
well you that is bad luck on top
obvious troll is obvious
i guess we all know what he did wrong most of us do at least the question is whether he should be wiped from the history books for it and getting his shiny medal taken away like a referee dropping by your house to collect your soccer trophies after you got sent off in your latest match
no its more like the olympic comittie revoking your medal because they found out you cheated during the olympics and that was why you won
considering the charm of eve in terms of significance is its single shard what happens happens to all the attempt to mask a part of its history like this is pretty pathetic lark may have been underhanded in his insider trading efforts but considering that is entirely within the spirits of the games ethics its a disappointment in the least to see ccp trying to rewrite the history books
thisran  what is this be stupid day derp derpif we wanted him wiped from history we wouldnt be bringing it up now would we
that is a poor analogy dear even from you perhaps if i had been found to have somehow subverted the datebase during the actual election that would be more fittingi was most upset to discover that my medal had been removed but not so upset as to protest about it on the forums im afraid shigsy is merely trying to express his love for me by trying to do me a good turnedit adding my support anyway
supporting because lark made a few videos i enjoyed
he should get his place back on the wiki simple history is not changed by a moment of stupid the medal not so much  thats a fair thing to strip
he was a volunteer trying to improve everyones gameplay and he used some information like all of us would dont lie to make a little isk for himself it simple corruption and it happens all the time plus for people saying he had an unfair advantage he didnt you try getting the reputation to be able to win csm election its probably not easy
the whole larkonisgate deal is a bit odd so the csm cant let anything they learn effect what they do in game is this true of ccp employeesso if i was planning on buying billions worth of warp core stabilizers before im on the csm but then after a csm meeting find out ccp is likely to nerf warp core stabilizers  im still duty bound to buy billions worth of them if i dont im in breach of a nondisclosure agreement i would like to see the agreementscsm members need to signi find it ironic that the csm was created because ccp lost the faith of the players when their own employees where very blatantly cheating flat out spawning blue prints in their own game which by the way does have a tie in with real money we get no repercussions against that employee yet ccp ends turning the tables against a player in csm who supposedly didnt properly pretend he didnt hear stuff he heard its getting reversed like in soviet russiaim not in favor of dirty rotten contract breachers nor do i like dishonesty but these rules seem far from clear we can see ccp is quick to tighten the reigns on this organization which was created due to ccp employee cheating but what about the original intent of the csm i will also say my hunch is that larconis had to be very honest about his motivations or ccp would have had a tough time proving anything
lark bought goods up after he found out not before not way before he didnt have a bloody stockpilecome on people sheeshdont you think hed gone after them legally if that wasnt the casethats called entrapment not something ccp would pull consideringme epic facepalm
emphatic thumbs downi think ccp was far too kind to him and he should have been permabanned for that it was too minor for real world legal action but that would not have been inappropriate just wastefuland to those who think that nothing was revealed the market is a public place when someone buys or sells something from you it shows in your transaction journal therefore anyone who was transacting with larkonis would immediately know what he was transacting and how much and knowing he was a csm its not rocket science to conclude if the transactions were at all unusual and they were  otherwise he wouldnt have gotten caught then what was going to take place was publicly revealed to anyone who happened to lookand yes ndas also have as a standard clause a you may not benefit from this info outside of the benefits stated in this contract clausehaving done a bunch of stuff for a couple of major game companies and worked in the industry for awhile ive had to read and sign a few over the years theyre pretty standard in the base particularsoh and a former csm confirmed that clauses were broken which just puts the cherry on topi dont hate lark or anything although i dont agree with him on just about anything either  but i still believe he got off far too lightly
so what in my case you would be changing your actions after you hear from the csm as welli dont know what you are talking about here and i have a hunch you dont either 
fix this please ccp cant advertise big moves to 00 and massive fleet fights when their infrastructure cannot handle it welcome to 00 enjoy massive fleet fights where youll get tostare at black screens for hourshave little to no control over you shiphave your ship blown up hours before you actually realize its goneyou dont even have to be logged inget instantly transported from your ship with full hp to your pod in a stationthe dominion trailer was not a trailer at all it was a fictional video about a game that hasnt been invented yet it surely wasnt eve

i agree make the damn 5 minute post thing for anyone 100 posts and with  3 months service or something thats the reason the assembly hall sucks so much cause no way i can vote on things if it takes me 3 hrs to vote on 10 threads lol taking into account how many times im waiting to vote and forget the damn window in the background waiting for the 5 minutes to expiretime flux detectedyou are going too fast wait five minutes and try againgo back one page  go back to forumsargggg i just want to vote i guess ill post this vote in 5 minutes
the funniest thing about it is how ridiculously easy it is to bypass and make multiple posts within the five minute limit anyway
see

so true so truei never really understood making guided and unguided missiles then giving one a bonus instead of the other so supported
idea make a low slot module that when fitted would make it more difficult for cargo and ship scanner modules to give an accurate report on what is being carriedslotted right now scanning is weighted in favor of the aggressor with little to no recourse from the potential victim i say a low slot module because then the hauler has to choose between more cargo space or slightly more obscure cargo holdone possible issue i see is that illegal cargo runners may have a slightly easier time of getting their illicit goods past the customs agents so that is one balance aspect that will need some looking atcomments criticism

i want to propose the ability to install defensive posts in soverignty enabled systems basically beyond just pos bubbles with guns the ability for a soverignty system to install gate guns and gate launchers in their systems at gates to defend against pirates and against sbu teams etcbasically like the current military levels etc either tie it to the military level or a new level that will allow you to upgrade the pgcpu of the gate and install gunslaunchers like a pos ecm wouldnt be allowed as i think that would be overpowerful as someone roaming into a system would be locked down with no chance to escape and note im not suggesting the ability for a gate to have death star style defenses lol but at say military v the ability to have 56 gate guns or something like that and if military falls below the needed level the pgcpu drops and necessary guns are offlinedalso if this is done you might be asking who would the gate guns fire at well i believe this should be just like pos set via the gate management to alliancecorpor standing based
not supported 00 is lawless defend it yourself sentry guns on gates and stations would ruin smallgang pvp and guerrilla warfare
this was supposed to be implemented when dominion came out for whatever reason they removed not because its lawless poor excuseat a certain degree of cost of course as you increased your military indexsupported
nullsec isnt lawless its just not concord protected and patrolled its governed and protected by its own soverignty holders why shouldnt they get some offline defenses for their territorieshow does it kill the roaming gang pirates are mostly lowsec roaming nullsec gangs just need to get away from the gate fast or tank them as they already know they can do in highsec experiencealso considering a proper defense military v requires actual work to maintain its not like every system in regions would have it mostly just the capitals and shouldnt capitals be defended roaming pirate gangs are fine but roaming pirate gangs that can warp through a capital and try to sneak past without worrying about anything is stupidsupported
so what youre saying is that cruisers and frigates should be nerfed into uselessness anywhere near a station or gate sforcing roaming gangs to fit for tanking gate guns will kill small ship warfare if you want that style of play then go to low sec
you want gate guns go to lowsecyou want nullsec defend yourselfnot supported
yes but not like low sec gate guns they shouldnt instapop ceptors they should be able to prevent a lone ceptor from camping a gate
i support it as gate guns have appropriate price tag dps and power no infinite tanking fr instant vaporisation of small targets like in lowsec the automated defences should be fairly limited and provide a little support not ultimate protection they would make the ssytems you own slightly safer for you not safe it makes snece though as long as kept balanced guns on outposts should be twice or more powerfull then on gates gate guns should not vaporise random travelers but unless you got a formidable fleet you should not be coming anywhere near enemy outpost the most expensive and important thing in the system after all you cannot camp people in there poses why should you be able to camp a station so easy ofcource the guns can be vaporised given enough firepower like posguns they would go offline after being taken in hull so a fleet camping hostile gate would offline them or blow them up if they need to and continue camping
perhaps small ship warfare shouldnt exist in populated 00 systems they are already referred to as t1 suicide gangs because of how quickly they are destroyed when they suicide into populated systems their purpose is to annoy other players more than anything it costs almost nothing to throw suicide fleets at an alliance but forces them to call up a defensive fleet every time this isnt a good balance in fact the current mechanic rewards players for throwing suicide alt fleets around it borders on griefing to throw a suicide fleet at another alliance every 1530 minutesas long as the gate guns dont instalock preventing cloaking ships from cloaking or have the ability to track a ceptor gate guns should exist in populated sov space basically it shouldnt kill a scout but it should hurt suicide gangs
sure if you removed them from lowsec gates
00 carebear best carebear sighs
ya not gate guns but pos style guns for at gates wud be good not the invuln uber ultra concord guns lol
this shouldnt protect 00 carebears
i could accept having a sov upgrade that gave gates pg to anchor pos guns they shouldnt get lowsec perfecttracking gate guns but for a sufficient cost some fixed defences would be fine
so whom will it protect the roaming gang camping your systemor do you need your pvpers some protectioncompared to the roaming gang you already got the infrastructure advantage pos outpost and now you would get some extra dps when fighting them on the outpost or gatesounds balanced to me
no it should reduce the suicide gang griefing the riskreward is heavily skewed towards throwing a handful of t1 ships at someones sov space constantly and people do this
i always thought thats why people go to nullsec to get the fights over system having epic battles without worrying about sec status no
shooting the same 4 pilots in the same 4 t1 frigates every 1530 minutes is far from epic allowing people to fit a small pos gun on their gates would go unnoticed by a normal gang let alone an epic fleet especially if the gun can be incappeddestroyed
00 carebears are even worse than lvl4 runners
wow you have to fight in your space if you dont like it go to empire or dock up as the other carebearsa few pos guns on a gate nuking support will be noticed it is still dps you dont have to bring for a fight it is still dps you dont have to fc during the fight it might be enough to drive of some tackle or logistics during a fight something you couldnt have achieved otherwise as your focus was elsewhere
the idea is that people go to 00 to live there but what some like you seem to prefer is that people go to 00 only to fight and stick to high sev lvl 4 missions for income would also mean that there wont be much roaming left to do
there is a difference between ships coming for a fight and spamming an alliance with suicide gangs darius what alliance are you in that you are either unfamiliar with or do not want to lose this tactic from your retorts it sounds like you lack some pretty basic pvp experience a few small pos guns cant nuke support unless they are idiots  a single frigate would have to turn on the mwd and sit still to die i think 12 guns is all that should be allowed anyway small pos guns do about 100150 dps per gun and have a fairly poor tracking if your pvp gang cant handle that they should go back to mining
do you even live in 00 this would destroy small gang frig  cruiser gang and solo roaming in 00automation is not the way to defend your space we want players versus players absolutely not supported
ahh so you vote to disable pos auto defense as well since automation is stupid apparently cause apparently thats what seems to be what your suggesting no one suggested outpost guns tho non automated outpost guns do sound cool lol
ahh yes hope lets hope that enemys of which ever alliance is defending or attacking a system just dont show up in force because we spend hours of gameplay and alot of money in monthly fees to hope that the enemy wont bring their full force to defend  attack yes i may be complaining a bit but what im saying is this is still an unfair factor to the victem regardless of whos side hes on and untill ccp have found a soloution to this problem which is their problem and not the players reimbursements should be handed out to those who are the are on the receivng end of this horirble factor it makes me feel as long as we are paying our fees ccp are happy to say no because they expect us to pay more fees to be able to play long enough to get a new ship and hope that in the next big fight the same problem wont happen again then ofcourse it does and the process is repeated wether our side wins or looses their is always someone that has to go through this issue and these are the people that should be reimbursed this is a topic against your reimbursement policies as much as it is your lag issues
i strongly suspect ccp is aware of problems caused by lag as is every single online game company in the world i for one am amazed that you can pack 1000 ships into the same grid without complete failure there are many on2 number of operations needed to complete a task is proportional to the square of the number of users tasks involvedeve is a sandbox and ccp will never say you cant bring more than x players to a fight players will always try to outnumber the other team until the point at which lag makes the game unplayable if you dont want laggy fights dont go to a huge fleet fight you are setting yourself up for disappointment
ccp set these fights up with the new dominion set upif fleet a places sbus with 500 ships as backfleet b has to have the same amount of shipsat leastridiculous to complain that we shouldnt bring these numbers of ships to a fightwhen ccp set up these mechanics
this isnt lag anymore its broken and unusable mechanics it is clear by now that this is not going to be fixed any time soon what ccp has now isnt even in the save universe as what they are advertising all over the internet for them to presume that they can continue to develop their way out of these issues at the expense of some of their customers is unacceptable
so how many cvapets have been on the mass testing event
im pretty sure your inability to format is the problem hereccp knows about the lag  im sure theyve heard more assembly hall posts oughta speed em up 
youre a troll plain and simple if ccp would like to they just could read news and watch the community we dont need mass testing events for this there are plenty of fights happening which are bigger than a mass testing event ever could bethe lag sooner or later will kill this game also with the new mechanics ccp didnt managed to think it through and see why it happens that over a thousand people mass thereself on a single point of interestthe only useful answer till yet in this thread was the one of camios hes suggesting to split the fights this could be a good solutionin eve it was always a problem that while we have open space we are limited to single points of interest celestialsand this is because ccp dont allow us to free flight in our space we cant put up stations where we want to and everything we build is immediately on our overview there is no strategy needed in this game only thing that counts is mass the most interesting fights are when five people move somewhere and other five people find them by coincidence lagfree and its not looking like someone set it up the new sovmechanics solved no problems we are also still shooting pos and due to absolutely crappy modules the pos has no chance to defend itself its just a joke and has nothing to do with starships and the very well made video advertisements we see in front of every expansioncheersspeedcat
if only something like this had happened just a few weeks ago and you had learned from it
so i heard that ccp always strive to keep the server at optimum performance and regularly upgrade their hardware and code however in situations such as fleet battles they cannot always achieve this goal it is impossible for them to measure how much lag each person has and even harder to verify which losses were the result of lag and which losses were legit reimbursing losses from large battles due to possible lag which is unverifiable from their end would in essence mean removing the risk of loss from fleet battles entirely and thereby nullify their whole purpose i am sorry that they cannot assist you and i hope you understand their stance on this matter
yes it is definitely trolling to point out that ccp is actively working on itif you would have taken the time to read the postings you would have known that they ran some code with debugging enabled to get the data they needed something you cant do on tq without making the normal performance worseyou wanted to have your fleet fight today with debug codeand as viper said  you didnt learn from wi vs atlas you didnt learn from plgoons vs it in y2 repeat their errors and come to the forums and cryyes this will definitely help to solve the problem
yes there are too many topics on the forum about lag ohh it was laggy and i died i shouldent even move etc etc yes this post adresses that but what it also adresses is the no reimburse due to lag thing they have going on at the momentim thinking if ccp claim know exactly what the problem is why are they not reimbursing ships to the pople that loose them in these conditions i would die smiling if only i could go down swinging but i cant even die whilst watching my enemy shoot me this deserves reimbursement maybe if you started giving ships back to the victems of this mess ccp you wouldent have x ammount of people saying they are on the brink of stopping paying for their subscriptions untill the matter is solved
dominion is obviously flawed hoping for a speedy recovery
i forgot ccp magically fixes problems they simply need to know a problem exists then without any idea why the problem occurs presses the big red magic fix it button and magic fairies sprinkle pixie dust on the server and all is betterin good scientific method style ccp has been attempting to test the problem in a controlled environment so they can identify the bottleneck and fix it unfortunately they picked a dumb time to run a test requiring a good turnout they continue to rely on players to spread the word on when a test is going to happen i can understand a complaint about the time of the tests andor how much effort ccp has put into trying to make the player base aware of the test i cannot understand complaining about ccps magic wand not working
buy 1000 tritanium now make stacks of 1 tada instant invisible cargo
i support this request and this above feature wud be wicked counter scanner equipment
counter scanner  ability to view market details sounds good to me
seriously this is dead already stop it 1 this has been said before warping missiles are like fighter drones without having to train for or buy a carrier this eve not wow and things take time2 in a fleet fight target all missiles on the secondary target not the primary targetthat way you dont loose dps as the missile boats always fire on the secondary and another nice little thing you automatically spread out the enemies logistic powerthere now i solved the problem for you now stop whining about missiles and making suggestions that would make them overpowered
the only drawback to this is that cruise missiles generally do superior dps to turret ships setup to shoot that far so maybe we should introduce special warp enabled guided missiles they would still have their base range limitations that are currently implemented would only be a factor for lightheavy really but i dont think frigates should be shooting lights 250km away but could strike from long distance of course having an onboard warp engine would mean a smaller warhead and less damage output but if a raven or typhoon for example with guided warp missiles could do 300dps from 220km that would be kinda nice and mean people can bring missile ships to fleetsyou are really good at reading and as far as missile retargeting yes cruise missiles do higher dps vs battleships than turrets however the 20 seconds delay does make them rather unusable in fleets
perhaps some t2 missiles which would be instant damage like turrets but instead offer lower damage lower than turrets but not to the point of uselessnessyou could also give them insanely low explosion velocity so you it would only be able to hit nearstationary targetsalso your name ftw
i like 1 but i agree this should require a missle upgrade in a medlow spot for autotargetting missle guide2 i like the idea of adding a new type of guided warp missle that is unable to fire at 150km so range skills wud take 150km as 0km and calc range from their for their actual distance
missile retargeting with a module autotargeting missile computer in a low med spot sounds like a good idea not so sure about guided warp missles they would have to be balancedand no they wouldnt replace fighters their 1 missile and they can only hit things on grid just over 150kmthey wont be able to follow a target into warp if they did follow a target into warp they better have a much lower dps
supported definitly would also like to see the 5m limit removed from assembly hall votesalso  i suggest inthe assembly hall forced voting if your going to leave a comment you must check neutral pro con that way people that are pro dont accidentally leave it neutral
clearly something needs to changeone issue that i have when i vote and i always do is that getting a real handle on the positions of the candidates is difficult some were easy choices this last one was incredibly hard as i couldnt find a single candidate that i felt would represent anything like the majority of my opinions about things that need work in the gamesince thats the point of the organization thats an issuethis is the 21st century we can fix that we have the technologylets start with some basic ideas first of all we want to know what the candidates stand for this should be readily available information when someone tosses their hat in the csm ring they should be required to fill out a form on their views which should then be available as a summary for all candidates in a simple chartthis could be broken up into various sections of the game for instancesuicide ganking 110where 10 is everyone should be doing it and 1 is doing it should get you banned 5 is current status quo is fine someone then looking at a candidate could then see their stance on suicide ganking and know if they feel it should be made easier harder or stay the samethese are very very general views naturally and reading what the candidate has to say on them would be important but it at least lets you filter the candidates down to five or six you can really study who are closest to your own views you could even take the survey yourself the same survey and have the system rank the candidates in order from how close their opinion matches yours to how far away they are either on a specific issue or a specific subset of issues high sec matters etc or overall with all topicsanother thing  we have certificates now characters running for csm should temporarily have their certificates made public as part of their campaign that will give some idea of their ability ingamefinally things like their sec status and standings should be made publicyes  this means running for csm throws a very public spotlight on you good you want the job you get the limelight for all the good and ill that comes withthese things would i think increase voting in the csm in fact perhaps taking the survey and viewing the candidates should be something put up at login as part of the game yes those who dont care could simply press spoil ballot and get on with the game but it would raise the interest of many players and get them thinking each candidate in addition to their ratings and public stats could have a short maybe 1000 words statement of their main platform and what they wish to help ccp focus on and accomplishare these a panacea no of course not but they are tools that would improve i believe participation in csm elections right now everyone just says well there will be goons and some big alliance people and maybe a single token carebear who will get ignored and dont bother to voteperhaps with better tools and more visibility to the population of new eden as a whole we might see better representation perhaps even a carebear dominated council wouldnt that be an odd thingi dont want to see any part of eve ignored high sec low sec and null sec are all integral parts of the game and all need more love as a player i often joke about loathing pirates  and yet we need them in eve and they need more attention to make their careers better and viable without bad guys who would the good guys fight wheres the excitementevery part of the game has areas that need work whats important is making the voice of the players known to ccp not just the voice of a few special interest groups with too much ability to emphasize that voice under the current systemtheres my 02 isk on things
did you see vote match during the last csm elections it isnt quite what you suggest but was a pretty good ideai wouldnt have a problem with this but it really only shows their ability to train various skills eg my main has a raft of skills from when i was learning the game that mean nothing industrial and trade skills that would make me out to be a trading expert when ive only used them a handful of timesthey are already public open people and places search for character show info view sec status and standings it would be easier to have it in one place of course but somebody could have provided it just as dierdra vaal provided vote match i would like to see some of these things in a future election portal along with the ability to vote in game via the igb would be finethere was a box for this on the candidate list where the campaign statement from the csm application was put some people decided to leave it blank or put in a lol type answer however it was never stated that the box could have html formatting the apps were sent via email and ccp never updated the text when asked so it became of limited usethe bigger alliances have the muscle to get somebody or in the goons case 2 people voted in but that is mostly down to the well organised nature of alliances ok well organised might be a stretch in some cases but the point is they are generally loyal to their own memberscarebears are frequently solo or small corp focussed and as a whole lack the organisational structure to bloc vote even though clearly they could have pushed in a few candidates if they wanted tomany of us didnt have the benefit of thousands of guaranteed alliance votes my alliance have about 150 people so they actually had to campaign this at least demonstrates a level of commitment even if you dont agree with the platform they run onas i wanted to be proactive i took advantage of vote match i did live debates on split infinity radio as did 3 other people in the csm and one of the alternates i also taught pvp classes with agony and a guest lecture spot with eve university i blogged tweeted and directly interacted with the voters to answer questions etci put in the effort and was lucky to get enough people to support me which is why i take the responsibility seriously and put in the time to discuss issues as well as taking on a very time consuming rolethe current system does not value the commitment a csm member is willing to or does put in which should probably be looked at
i did but at the time i tried it couldnt get it to work properly might have been browser settings not sure i thought it a good concept but since the darned thing wouldnt work for me lacking in executioni know  i have some i dont use as well its good to have something to go on though and with the closure of ghost training there is less training of skills folks dont plan to use at least on newer characters its not perfect heck nothing is but its more info to go on i know but wading through it all for thirty candidates writing it all down etc  just too finicky for most to bother i only checked the 34 of the folks i personally considered for my vote  and that means i may have missed something importantwell now that the igb actually works well mostly anyway certainly light years better than previouslyin the real world governments put out a lot of effort for voting the system we have works after a fashion but there is a lot of room for improvementcompletely agree the hard part is quantifying it in some way that isnt open to folks saying the csm is just making themselves look real goodi think a record of work put in in some fashion number of meetings attendedmissed and the persons voting record should be summarized somewhere again easily accessible without tons of diggingvoters are by and large kind of lazy thats human nature i research who i vote for but even im lazier than i should be by my own standards even so im sure i do more than most folks who vote for the person they know or on party lines etc its why incumbents in the real world have such a huge advantage
a which is why i addressed you concerns in my postb also addressed in the post i think isk sinks should be service based rather then product based if there arent enough services in which to sink them then make some up fixing or eliminating insurance not going to happen would go a large way to helping the isk problem for instancec which makes it a rather poor form for removing isk from the game
again pay the crew to fly the ship while good for immersion could break the game for people low on isk what part of pay to fly is bad are you missingfly a frigate they have no crew is a very weak reply you want to do level 1 missions or kill frigate sized targets to pay for you pvp shipsyou want to discover that you have finished the isk midway during a fleet op and that you crew has gone on strikebe unable to dock the ship you are using the docking fees you suggested and unable to pay the crew while you stay in spacewhat sould be the effect ship dead on water your pod ejected in space as soon as you are incapable of paying the crew
what i am having trouble understanding is why you are cherry picking things to argue with from my post using red herrings and continuing on a track entirely superfluous to the ophow is that different from now thenalthough you conveniently ignored it i already suggested rolling the fees together in to one perhaps instead of paying to dock you pay to undock based on ship type or ship hull there are so many solutions itUFFFDs not that hard to come up with themcovered by my previous sentence but also covered in the post you quoted from home base is free to dock etcdebt forget the crew fee and go for one undocking fee that covers that cost live with the consequences of flying a ship without having bothered to make sure you can afford it and pod home make some other entirely unrelated isk sinki really think you are imagining fees far higher then reasonable and your arguments are entirely spurious and disingenuous you are perfectly capable of thinking of all the various solutions to the problems you present if i were to make an actual proposal on this board then id be sure to consider all of these things and present a complete picture of what i envision again the really point i was making which is related to the op is that alternative isk sinks can be found and that products players buy can be left to players to manufacture
i have to support this in my opinion eve shud allow for 100 to be buildable by the industrialistsmake nanite repair paste very wasteful and components be costly so taht prices stay high not having a bpo is stupid to say because they want to keep costs high they can keep costs high with a bpo still just make the ingrediants cost the same as current tritnocx etc so that it can be produced for  the same amount of cost well a little cheaper at prod eff v due to heavy waste on the bpo
give industrialists more to build why keep it in npc hands eves 1 industrial reason is that its all maintained and continues to prosper because the industrialists produce things not npcs i say nanite repair paste should have bpos seeded make it use tritmexnocxgases and maybe even a spare would be nice to have something else that requires gas to manufacture
hey hey dominion upgraded the black ops portal to be able to bridge directly to a cyno beacon this is awesomeso i head out to play and test  when i right click my capacitor to get the options to bridge or jump it gives me the jump to but it gives me a huge list of systems all online beacons and i can only physically jump to 9  its even worse when i try to bridge to as i get the same list of systems but aranged in 0b  bq  sz  drop out lists  its the same when we use caps is there any way to have this list to actually have functionality and only list beacons within range before you say capital navigation window you cannot bridge using right click from the cap navigation window and only jump toso can we if possible have bridge to as an option in the cap nav window and arrays within range only in the right click context menu for capital shipsblack ops pretty please with sugar on top
this seems to make sense
agreed
well i have an idea about rockets to make them useful againrockets should keep their low range but launcher cycle time should be very fast but reload extremly slowperhaps a penalty should be applied to the person firing rockets ie increased sig radius while firing them or velocity halved or tremendous capacitor need to firethe idea is that you should be able to unload alot of damage over a short period of time
and this idea will insure that even if they fixed rockets no one would use themnot supported
rockets need fixing but this is not the fix your are looking for
1 low range got that because every weapon system has 2 options blaster  rail pulse  beam rocket  light missilebut extending the reload time on the smallest weapon system in the game the reload time on missiles in general is already terrible just how much longer would you want to take to stick a cardboard tube in a hole2 what other missile system has penalties to compensate for their sheer awesomenessa whens the last time you shot some bottle rockets off in the backyard for new years and literally became larger than lifeb i could see a velocity reduction if your ship is lighter than 100kg but im pretty sure were all bigger than thatc right because all the other missile systems burn cap to fire too what they dont thats why passive shield drake is the single most popular ship in the skies ohunless all these crappy ideas amount to rapid fire 2mil damage doomsday rockets i dont think youll find support anywhere around here
mindnumbingly unwieldy change to the dscanner
the support system isnt a way to vote for if the idea is good or bad its a way of forcing the csm to bring it up with ccp if enough people support it
dont supportreply say something about why you think the ideaproposal is wrong that is much better than cookie cutter i dont support this which isnt useful for feedback or anything other than for some unknown reason crazy biased etc you dont support the ideawhy i dont support this
if you dont think the csm should be wasting time with an issue you should be able to express that the current system is like an election with only one name on the ballot
this would be redundant by default no topic has any supports which means every character with forumposting ability is already not supporting it
hard to see how many are for and how many are against in a 20 page threadnaught littered with circular debates
not only that but if someone doesnt vote one way or another they may just not know enough about the issue to post or even bother to read the original post
i think the ratio of replies to supports is a sufficient indicator when it comes to threads with 10 pages of debate i trust the csms to navigate the thread and come to a reasonable position on whatever the proposal may be rather than just defaulting to whatever a vote tally tells them to do id rather consider them as rational minds as opposed to the puppet of foragainst tallythis could be the case with someone supporting or not supporting not just someone who abstains from voting i think the stronger arguments from either side of a heavily contested issue will far outweigh the effects of a nonvoting noncontributor
im not saying its impossible to get lp after the change i am saying many people said this would lead to people leaving fw and low sec and well they were right many major pvp corps are leaving you see there will almost always be money to be made because the fewer people doing missions the higher the worth of the lp but now in order to farm efficiently you should join a pve centered corp because if you dont have a group of people to go with you on missions its going to be tough if you are in a big group that likes to do pve farming fleets youll be fine thats because when you have a big fleet of people who do allot of pve you can all ask for missions and turn them down when they are in bad systems and do the same sort of cherry picking this was supposed to prevent however the people who joined fw mainly for the pvp and join a pvp corp wont have lots of buddies to cherry pick missions with they get hit hard either do the carebear corp thing or like i said make eve your full time job so that you can decline every 4 hours andor play at odd hours when the systems are empty so yeah if you are lucky enough to live in an off peak time zone or you can stay up till 4am you will love this change because now its no longer a level playing field those people and those people alone will be able to do the missions in systems that arent crowded with piratesand of course some factions are supposedly easier to do missions for than others to the extent this is true it should be fixed
like this guy says ccp should just clean up the bloody awful mess they made with fw and fix the bandaid at that timedefinitely not supported
you dont think anyone can ever make 2300 mill isk per hour in any other area of the game well they can and in many different ways but the thing is most people cant make that doing fw missions they couldnt under the old rules and they cant now some joker says yeah they make 500 bazillian and everone quotes him the market adjusts yes if you happen to get a good turn you can make allot in eve not just fw missions but the market adjusts if its so easy to get fw lps then no one would make any money it would be like tech 1 bps the thing is do you want people to make money in fw missions just because they can log in when few are online or do you want an even playing field that is what this proposal is really about
i want them to fix fw including the ed ass mission system which this proposal wont do on any level meaning it wont fix fw missions even they were broken before the refix and they are broken now the op just wants it returned because he is whining about his cash cow being taken away i can still do them they are just annoying as hell now if you cant manage the lvl fours do the level threes in an inty or something no it really isnt about that at all
im not sure what you want to fix in fw missions i would agree that if they are unbalanced based on faction  like minmatar can speed tank rats in an inty but amar and gallente cant  then this should be balanced also if one side has more top agents that should be fixed but you didnt indicate what you would want to fix and these issues are somewhat beside the point of this topicas far as running level 3s in an inty  i cant fly inties and before i would train them to run level threes i would want to know amarr missions can be done in them i couldnt finish some level 3 missions for amarr in a caracal so im dubious about trying it in an inty the minmatar rats tend to hit you with allot of target painters im wondering if you may just be able to do that because the rats are not balanced what faction do you fly for i give you reasons why allowing people to get missions in low traffic systems evens the playing field you ignore those reasons and just say no it really isnt about that at all do you not agree that a substantial difficulty if not by far the main difficulty in completing fw missions is the risk of other players coming in to gank your pve ship do you not agree that this means you are better off doing missions in systems that are not heavilly populated do you not agree this gives an advantage to people who can log in at non peak times do you not agree that this advantage to those people is blunted if people who have to log in during peak times can at least cycle through missions until they can get one in a lower populated system if you answered yes to all these questions you should be able to see that the old mechanic simply helped level the playing field for those who can only log on during the peak times as far as whining about a cash cow i suppose that info on basic supply and demand didnt phase you one bit people will make money at these missions the only question is how accessible they will be to your average mostly pvp minded fw pilot they used to be accessible to people regardless of when they could log on now after the change they arent very accessible to those who log in during peak times and surprise surprise people can no longer afford pvp in fw and leave fw in droves
there are many proposals in this forum that focus on specific quality problemsissues instead of addressing these issues individually i think ccp needs to improve their whole qa function qa is more than testing it is about continuous improvement learning from each mistake and ensuring that mistake is not repeated ccp needs to hire an experienced software qa specialist with experience of continuous improvement if ccp already have this person they need to further empower that person
confirming that i have 9 years of qa experience they should just hire me

id say its more analogous to seeing a ships resistances thats also something that you can definitely infer once you fire missiles at them in fact not just infer but calculate directly and which doesnt boost damage directly but pays a part in boosting that damagevelocity is a little different in that its not an attribute of the ship so much as an indication of the ships current manoeuvres and how the tactical situation is changing in that respect its a bit like the distance column it doesnt tell you anything about the other ship per sehaving the sig radius up would allow you to know in advance which targets you could do full damage to dynamically and thus removes a nonnegligible part of combat tactics currently one has to try to determine the most effective target to attack based on an assumption of their likely fittings and thus how easy it will be to damage them compared to the threat they pose having the actual sig radius visible would make it notably easier to determine the easiest targets to hit in advance just like having a targets resistances shown or worse ehpim not saying this is a bad idea per se but it definitely changes the way target prioritisation works dumbing it down slightly and removing the experience factor as well as making it slightly harder for pilots to try something out of the box without that being identified until too late there are certain attributes about the enemy ship that you can infer but its important that you go through the process of doing soso  to my mind this makes pvp slightly less complex and rewarding and doesnt make a difference in pve on can look up actual sig radii anyway on websites like this if so inclined and its static per npc type

well the following item has csm support but has not been progressed any further so feel free to add it to this meetingincrease forum signature file size limitations
tbh some of the issues last term didnt have a great deal of supports numbers wise but a lot proportion wise as some of these do and its good that players are starting to pick up the slack and point out good suggestions that appear to have slipped through the net something ive seen more of this time around on this forumif youre getting told to do one due to spamming then name and shame
i want new posses as fast as possible
uhm lol your comparing artilleries that are for long range to blasters that are a close range weapon systemuhm helloooooooo wake up dude
grut the reason why i compared base stats is simple if the base stats are balanced and the ships arent then the problem lies with the ships not the weapons if you want to put some turrets on your scorpionor some other nobonus ship with enough fittingcap for anything you want you should have to at least think about what you want to use at present i think thats the case after the proposed buff i dont think it would be if you think the ships are too weak change the ships  id be fine with a rokh getting another 50km of targeting to free up a mid for example im not fine with unbalancing the guns so that the ships can stay unbalanced and itll all work out and regarding the nonrokh snipers the same sort of logic applies nobody cares about them because they have too much range and not enough firepower i mean hooray a harpy can hit out to 73km with railguns but nobody actually cares about that the eagle is short a damage bonus compared to other hacs the ferox is short a damage bonus a turret or bothdepending what you compare it to the vulture is used for links instead of guns the moa and merlin are mostly for new players and the raptor is too slow for its role to my understanding the ships are a problem at least the eagle and ferox but that doesnt mean you should be pinning the problems on the guns bagehi the number that stands out most there is just how well lasers track an unbonused tachy tracks better than a bonused 425  that seems wrong to me also how can you say gallente blow when the minmatar numbers are worse across the board a hyperion does the same dps as a maelstrom tracks faster and has noticeably longer rangeit takes 16 falloffs to equalize which is paintscratching range yeah the mael is capless it can switch damage somewhatthough its not missiles youre as likely to switch into an annoying damage type as out of it unless you carry 10 kinds of ammo and its alpha is better but it cant hit as far away or track as well which are both fairly major drawbacks in their own right im not trying to say that rails are perfect asis but a flat 15 damage is simply too much
supported railguns are bad and have been for as long as ive been able to use them once i was in a harpy and a wt in eagle warped to my gate 150km off but since i knew medium rails are bad i flew towards him and forced him to warp away now if you ask me i should have had to warp off im pretty sure it wasnt a fail fit because ive gotten similar results from my eagle
i must be missing something herei was under the impression that galente was a rail gun and drone race the caldari was a projectile gun and missile racethat is why gal makes better use of the rails than a caldari wouldmight as well lose projectile and laser and make every race good at railssheeshthe boats themselves especially the destroyers need some tweaking granted train and use drones for ranges beyond the rails do the same for missiles if you are caldarivery minimal missile traininglvl 4 on launcher and standard missile and lvl 3 on support skills with a decent fit for my cruiser and i hit and kill at 45km with standard missiles more time training and that range and damage will only increasepersonally i prefer missiles over drones
15 damage would make rails the ultimate long range weapon that is stupid however i do fail to understand why do tachyons have so much grater tracking speed sure they use more cap but a 2x tracking difference so there are 2 ways to go about this slight buff to the ships to make them balance out more lock range maybe powergrid whatever is appropriate reducing tachyon tracking somewhat to make rails and projectiles more competitive i dont want to give rails simple damage buff as that would break them giving them slightly more tracking would be acceptable giving them more range so although they dont have much damage and eat cap they outrange everyone and outdamage at midranges due to using showter range ammo maybe but as hershel pointed out problem is in somewhat underpowered ships small buff to rails would be ok about 57 but not 15 this coming from a railuser
the caldari gunboats are in serious disadvantage against any other races gunboats because of their lack of damage bonus yes they make great snipers but they are awful in pve so i think this is a good ideaalso the moas hull should be in my opinion redesigned from scratch i dont know anyone who flies a moa a few people use its t2 counterparts but actually i havent met anyone who liked it
you are missing somethinga lot of things for that mattergallente use drones and hybrid weapons with an emphasis on blasters and damage bonuses caldari are a hybrid weapon emphasis on railguns and missile race whose gunboats have bonuses to optimal rangeactually the main reason why gallente boats are often the preferred railgun users is that the gallente boats have a damage bonus that partially offsets the terrible dps of a railgun while caldari are stuck with an optimalrange bonus that is often completely unnecessary for an already extremely longrange weaponwhat were you trying to get across was this part of your mistaken belief that caldari frequently use projectilesmessing with gallente and caldari gunboats also affects ships designed for blasters whose underperformance also raises issues i think it might help to reduce the number of turret slots on gallente boats by a slight margin so caldari boats without the damage bonus are more competitive but thats a separate issuethe issue at hand is that railguns suck the only thing they have going for them is extremerange performance and honestly not too many fights happen so far out that railguns outperform beams and artillery they have terrible tracking alpha and dps next to the other longrange turrets and to add insult to injury use a fair amount of capacitor were not talking about 45km pve stuff were primarily talking about pvp at sniper ranges going from 100250km depending on ship class and tactical scenario plus in pve railguns have terribad dps and a minor range advantage just doesnt cut it theres a reason the kronos is considered the worst of the marauders and thats railgunsthe classical sniping role is that of the largefleet battleship sniper at 140 or 240km 140 is just under the 150km warptowreck range while targeting range is capped at 249km in this kind of engagement missiles are never used by the snipers as by the time those missiles hit the targets already dead or warped out drones dont make the cut eitherthe 60km drone control range nonwithstanding sentry drones just dont reach out that far and the flight time on heavy and scout drones would be abysmalirrelevant were talking about turrets anyways you were commenting on a topic you knew very little aboutoh and supported
my observation from this summary would be that the longest range ship is a railgun platform after that excluding the one nonrailgun ship that has a bonus range all of the railgun ships are still within optimal while the others are all at optimal  12 falloff defining operational range as the range that still provides 80 or more base dps railguns have a 10 longer operational range than all of the other turrets on unbonused ships and comparing the ships that do have bonuses to range with each other railguns have a 19 longer operational rangeit would appear that the intended roll for railguns is range not damage
true let me show you something thoughto demonstrate if we apply a 15 increase to rails damage modifier and a 10 pg increase to the eagle we get the followingmunnin 195k ehpt2 720mm arties emp m t1  309 dps  2936 2713 volley tracking 004482t2 720mm arties carb m t1  209 dps  9436 1130 volley tracking 004706eagle 195k ehpt2 250mm rails am t1  325 dps  4720 1138 volley tracking 004967t2 250mm rails uranium t1  270 dps  8629 948 volley tracking 003148deimos 20k ehpt2 250mm rails am t1  360 dps 158 drone dps  2337 1345 volley tracking 005101t2 250mm rails spike t2  240 dps  8437 897 volley tracking 001275zealot21k ehpt2 heavy beams multifreq t1  448dps  2310 1110 volley tracking 005362t2 heavy beams aurora t2  299dps  8110 740 volley tracking 001341i call that a better balance than the current state of affairs what do you think

the point of the eagle is that it can out range most battleships not that it can compete with the other hacs for midrange damage output
you call 80km midrange for sniperhacs you obviously are1 misinformed 2 troll 3 mentally challengedi bet you are just a faceless alt and you dont have the guts to post with your main so i will pick option 2 of course it could be that you are a legitimate main that never undocks or has never flown a sniperhac therefore in that case your opinion is less than useful and can be disregarded ki tech public recordsok slightly different fit or just using t2 ammo how does that change the balance in favor of the eagle and the deimos it makes both of the railboats look worse than the numbers i used 80km engagement range so i presume you support my proposal

5 kinetic bonus makes the ability to use all four damage types useless in all fights these ships get 1 bonus unless fighting t2 minmatar2 options use kinetic bonus and have it reduced by targets resists use best damage type and get no bonuseither way the bonus is useless therefore change it please or simply remove it
not supported at allyes the kinetic bonus on some of the caldari ships is only for 1 damage type but how many advantages do you have over guns with 2 damage types with missiles thoughno tracking issues you hit all the time you do full damage at any ranges if the target isnt moving any fast and so onso i dont see any problems at all why some caldari ships shouldnt have a kinetic damage bonusedit lol this will be the same that my hound gets 15 bonus to torpedo explosive damage per level i dont goes omg omg cant i haz a rof bonus or damage bonus on my launchers instead no its because explosive its the minmatars damageif you get the kinetic damage bonus removed from those caldari ships who have those bonuses then i want my explosive torps damage bonus removed from my hound to so every torps does the same damage as my explosive torps does on my hound nowor it means that every other races ships with racial damage bonuses also should be removed totally so when you think about this this will never happensbut then whats the point on using a purifier over a hound if we take those racial damage bonuses away answer me thatso op just stop whining all races have some few ships that have racial damage bonuses you just have to live with it and if you dont like it then wow is this way 
can you at least concede that i defeated your earlier argument or are you sweeping that under the rug i dont see the op getting changed
it is you who are whining  all of your arguments are falsemissiles hit alway what  have you ever used them because they dontno tracking issues yeah if target using his mwd and forgets to move then missiles will hit max dmg but so do the turretsmissiles nearly never do full dmg against the same class or smaller turrets do most of the timeit is not about kinetic favour is bad but 5 kinetic dmglvl is way less than 5 dmg or 5 roflvl also it takes away one of the missiles advantage chooseable dmg typeif it would be 10 kinetic dmglvl it would be fine and balancedthis change wouldnt change stealth bombers bonusesif matar would only get explosive dmg bonus for their projectile guns that would be balanced
lol my arguments are falseexplain this to me then if kinetic racial damage bonus gets removed from caldari ships then for sure the amarrs gallentes and minmatars racial damage bonuses should be removed from every ship that have those racial damage bonuses to thats for sure do we agree on thatyour pretty stupid if you say that caldari can have its racial damage bonus removed while the other races will continue to have its racial damage bonuses your a good damn awefull troll if you say thatand because of that kinetic wont get removed from caldari ships ever as long the other races have racial damage bonuses and thats why your arguments goes against what im saying and its in fact you who are whining and it doesnt help what you have as an argument against what i said because its the fact what im sayingand because the other races will keep the racial bonuses then caldari will have its racial bonusend of story
except for stealth bombers there is only one non caldari ship with a racial damage bonus and it is the gallente covert opps
lets list those non caldari ships which have racial bonusesheliosstealth bomberstitans only for their doomsday2 t1 frigs which are crappy as hell and nobody uses themall in all lets remove all racial dmg bonusesand fix helios bonus too  that 2 t1 frigs lol
lol yeah keep dreaming buddy
i wish there was a place similer to high sec for pirates meaning only pirates could enter if you have a sec status of 49 or higher you get shot on sight
like the ideas except the low sec boarder idea its hard enough running a trade operation
it couldnt be like a single route channel from empire to empire anyway but many crossing points with back routes etcit just doesnt make sense that these empires who are supposed to be enemies are joined at the hip but say minnie and gallente space could be joined and caldari and amarr as they are allies just thoughts here anywaymany many good ideas get more
lowsec needs a boost for sure dont agrre on all your points but in general i like it
i have taken this idea to the ideas and features forumoutlaw
we really need outlaw expansionalso several game mechanics related to less legal activity and low sec needs real working meaning not only some random boost this and that but something real i think most of people consider low sec as the real outlaw space because its where flashy people are i think this should be the viewpoint when making up some new stuff problem with recent low sec oomphs is that they were really not helping the outlaw kind of activity muchi dont really know how you could point out one single thing which needs working on because theres so much but generally being an outlaw trying to catch minershaulers does not really work that well as in risking 300mil ship to kill 500k hauler which might drop you nothing except warp stabs then hear him complaining about how easy its to shoot a hauler thats after youve been waiting hours to see anyone
supported however i think that more than anything the session change reset is the biggest issue here however how can that be tackled easily im not sure it can
you know you can exploit what you suggest by micromanagement if you get free hp you just need join and leave fleet repeatedly this will cost ccp to make whole now way to count bonuses in order to prevent this i really dont think they are going to do this just for you
hi so i noticed today that when i docked up and went to activate my orca i misclicked and hit trash it now luckely there is always the do you wish to actually do this thing but still i just think there are a few places where the button places could be better such as the self destruct and input pos password button o and nidia reminds me that you cannot remove destination in any way other than going to the map to clear destination might i suggest having your destination system being a clickable button with the option for info and removing the destination on your autopilot overview thing
seems reasonable to me
sounds reasonablesuggestion when you rightclick an object and the popup menu appears make the trash option activate a submenu on the side show a right triangle there for submenu available and have a choice of confirm trash there then you have to click twice to really trash something but you dont have to wait for a pop up window and you dont remove your focus from the original menu click trash by mistake the menu is still there and you can select your real choiceyeah also agree on the map lovin might i also suggest an option to remove a waypoint remove the destination making the last waypoint if any the destination or remove route completely maybe an option on the left side buttons while docked
it is ui that makes a difference between a god game and an interesting but unplayable game current suggestion makes sense and is a good ui tweak
sounds good to me

i xialis being for the same corp and alliance as the op support this proposalwe all want more pvp but if high clone costs are keeping people from saying what the heck ill go join that fleet for fear of losing a 30mil clone because they dont see 30mil of benefit from the fight effectively lowering the number of people pvping in a pvp gamehigh sp chars in low ability ships dont have much advantage over low sp chars in the same ships so why should they be force to grind up much more isk to fight in those same ships this grind also keeps people from fighting as they are too busy grinding up some isk yes you can make heaps of money in 00 but you have to actually be doing that making money not pvping
thanks for the support and mostly friendly discussioni think destination skillqueue and xialis explained the costperformance better than i did why be wasting more time making money for your clone when the benefits are so low also i understand my proposed graph wasnt friendly to younger players and i wasnt happy with it i have now revised my numbers a bit and made a beter looking graph that makes the higher end higher and cheaper for the younger players my costs are based around that the first clone is at 1m skill points and should be fairly cheapnew proposed costsplease visit your user settings to reenable images
strongly supportedplayers are already risking implants and their ship it doesnt make much sense for older players to be penalized just because they have more sp
isnt that the ideaif you are flying a class of ship way lower than your sp would normally dictate or you are highly diversified across a wide spread of things then you should indeed have a steep financial drawback for flying around in smaller things meant for lower sp players yeah you can make that choice just like everyone else except if you do make that choice you are taking up a slot a younger player could be using so why not pay a cost for that right elsewise go start an alt or let someone with less sp in your roam spotthis game does not need anything added to help out older higher sp characters financiallythey already run the show let new guys gain some footholds here or you will end up with an indestructible glass ceilingrebalance the sinkif the sink is still there why even botherits alot of busy work to make the game cater to your personal play patterns and style morethis is not a pleases many idea so far its mostly just a pleases this corpalliance ideaknock it down
im am in full support of this granted i am a fellow corpie of the op but if you really have a look at the proposed changes they make senceit is no wonder when people start getting up higher in sp they ditch 00 because it is too easy to lose your pod and that cost of replacing starts to hit you hardanyway to all you haters out there stop and look at it from a 50mil sp pvp characters pov
that although i would support removal of exponential cost increase and replacing it with a straight line i dont honestly see anything positive in a close costing over 30 mill
taking up a slotthis is a horribly flawed argument that a few have used and not just in this thread the main determining in isk making ability in eve is time time to grind out the missions time to maintain your pos network time to run exploration sites time to sit and mine time to trade with trading probably being the least time intensive of those unless you own a t2 bpo in which case you can make the money with less time investmenti can guarantee there are players 14 my age with more money than i have or have ever spent in the game
if it was up to me to decide i would remove the whole clone thing all together maybe a small symbolical fee
currently all of the force recon ships except the falcon get range bonuses while the pilgrim does not if you arent familiar with recon ships the force variant shares 1 bonus aside from the hull bonus with the combat receives a covops cloak and cyno bonuss the rapier and arazu get range bonuss instead of the damage bonuss the falcon gets a strength bonus because the rook doesnt receive a range bonus because it doesnt need one the pilgrim on the other hand gets an amount bonus which would be similar to the damage bonus the the other force and combat recon ships get instead of the range bonus which seems to also break the common theme of the other recons receiving the first recon ship bonus stated in the description i feel as if the pilgrim should receive the range bonus instead of the amount bonus for usage reason toscenarios ive run into turn out with me not getting a kill i warp in cloaked to an asteroid belt where a see some guy mining why people mine solo in low sec is beyond me i would warp in to far from him to use my medium neuts or use a disruptor now i could slow boat cloaked to get closer to him but i would often more than not land next to something uncloaking me giving that person enough time to get away not to mention it takes time for drones to get close enough to do damage and if they have an active tank i cant use my neuts to stop that tankyou might say fly in a fleet with some friends if was going to fly in a fleet i would bring my curse
i fail to see how increasing the range of your neuts will stop a low sec miner from warping away before you get a point on him once you get a point on him does the few seconds needed to get from tackle range to neut range really give him any chance for survival
i would have thought that a transfer amount bonus would be the equivilent to the falcon ecm strength bonusalso a range bonus to vampsneuts wouldnt help you solo cause you wouldnt be able to get point on them and tbh if youre bumping into stuff in a belt as you slow boat towards a miner wow i cant even think of words to express how utterly impossible that should benot supported

force recon ships are designed for reconscoutingsupportcovertcynocyno rolenot for combat inspite of inheriting its combative aspects from its cruiser parents its just not meant for that kind of thingso i cant really condone bonus change as a resultps before you start screaming falcon the falcon excels are denying you the ability to shoot not known for killing you unless your epic fail
the pilgrim is a very good little solo boat and is in my mind the epitome of a stealthy solo hunting vesselsaying that it is the only one of the force recons which is unable to use both its ewar varients outside of web and scram range making them all but useless in long range cloaky recon death gangsits a toss up really and im undecided
lowsec isnt there for hisec people to exploitand make safe it is lowsec for a reason the lvl5s are in lowsec for a reasonthat reason is risk vs reward and even then it is still hugely unbalanced towards making hisec players richif you want to do lvl 5s join a corp that do lvl 5sif you want to do things in lowsec join a corp that does things in lowsecnothing makes people more angry than people moaning about how doing stuff is dangerous well sharks make me angrier but hey thats just me
facial ignore the ignorant haters glad youre not responding with some childish rant to them seems most people who read this just dont like anyone that isnt in 00 or losec or generally dont like anyone having an opinion at all theres a large part of this game thats about missions and i think it definately needs some more work i dont even need the mission guides any more its all predictable level 5s net me about 75k lp per run add the tags and the salvage and thats way better than l4sas for that idiot from goon saying you dont understand isk vs risk obviously you do as commented by others the risk of having your nh blown up by the environment is already high to add on the risk of being snared in losec you might as well just go rattingplexing
not supported you already have more advantages in little to no risk hisec as it is
i could never find the bloody mods when i wanted them so i cant really speak for themother than id like to see more of them seeded  o p
its not what i think should happen its what needs to happen it would put it in line with the other oreitems ice harvester iis bring in 2000m3 per harvester ok so make it the same as the ice harvester ii but with the increase to disntance instead of only 2km make it 5km so it would be 15km out to harvest here let me explain a bit more modulated strip miner ii  10km 360m3 orestrip miner  15km 530m3 ice harvester ii  10km 2000m3 oreice harvester  12km 1000m3 hmmmm not worth it at least the orestrip miner gives the increase to mining amount and no use of crystals so no more wasting isk on crystals but the oreice harvester only gives you a 2km distance bonus it needs to be 2000m3 and 5km instead of only 2km to make it inline with the other harvesters and oreitems
lord helghast  i am not trying to downgrade the oreitems they are meta 6 and t2 are meta 5 they should be better not worse and the changes would be an increase not a decrease by doing so it would not only fit it in with the other oreitems but actually make it worth buying then
i guess i just dont understand the need for a distance modification you dont move when you mine ice what does it matter if youre 10km 12km or 15km from an ice cube youre propulsion is at 0 ms i understand you want to bring it inline with the rest but shouldnt there be a need to do that not just becauseid go along with a cycle time decrease but not a m3 increaseedit actually i had to double check ice harvester iis do not bring in 2000 m3 only 1000 m3 the difference between the tech i and the tech iis is the cycle times 600 seconds down to 500 seconds they both operate at 10km optimal range too no difference so a cycle time adjustment and nothing else would be in line with other t1t2 items
then again it got me thinking again if you only increase the harvesting amount to 2000m3 youre actually still not increasing anything while the orestrip miner is still giving a mining amount bonus vs the t2 module so either a decrease in cycle time is needed or an increase in harvesting amount is needed to still put it inline with the orestrip miners bonuses either way an increase in amount harvested or a decrease in cycle time is needed my suggestion is to decrease cycle time max is 20501s right now so maybe 180s would be in line do to the large increase for the orestrip miner amount vs the modulated strip miner iis its an increase of 170m3 per cycle for the orestrip miners vs the modulated strip miner iis so a decrease in cycle time from 20501s to 180s is only a decrease of 70s i mean that number can be arranged by ccp but it was just a number i pulled off the top of my head for now
cyrus you got me checking numbers too and youre right about the amount they are also only 1000m3 but in order to bring the oreice harvester inline with the other oreitems a decrease in cycle time would be needed and an increase to the distance to 5km instead of only the 2km the only reason i am brining up the distance part is because the other oreitems have that bonus so in order to put it inline with the other oreitems that would have to be updated as well
you know you can buy this ore stuff only in two stations in outer ring someone going to have huge profit if this happensbut yes ore stuff sux
in an effort to reward active industrial players and haulers and provide a moderate level of protection that would balance game play versus gankers and attacks and make escorts more valuable i propose a new module that functions as a super damage control module titled the armadillo modulethe armadillo module would have a 999 cpu bonus for industrial ships requiring level 4 industrial skills mammoth inty iv inty v all transport class ships mining barges and exhumers to limit their use to industrial shipsthe module would function as follows upon activation it would drain the capacitor to provide 99 omni resistance for all shields armor and structure this shell would last for 30 seconds during the time the module is active the ship is rendered totally immobile basically balled up in the shell upon emerging from the shell the ships capacitor would be damaged so that it is maxed out at 5 level or as much as would be needed to jump only 1au for a period of 5 minutes this would prevent multiple uses within the 5 minute periodwhat this module would accomplish is to at least give indy ships a chance at some defenses it does not make the ships better so passive players do not receive any benefit by using a low slot industrialist must choose to sacrifice yield or cargo to use the module by providing only a small window of protection it will not drastically effect the solo miners and haulers in low and null sec what it will do is provide a small level of protection in high sec for the cavalry to arrive be it friendlies or concord but the biggest thing it will do is make combat escorts way more valuable if the paper mache ships knew they could protect themselves for 30 seconds that would give time for combat escorts in fleet to actually have a chance to prevent their destruction versus only being able to avenge it also it would require suicide gankers to fly ships capable of tanking concord for short durations or use larger fleets effectively increasing the size and cost of ships they would needtldrnew armadillo module or super damage controlrequires low slot and limited to certain industrial ships30 seconds of 99 omni resistances5 minute cooldown with wrecked capacitor to prevent repeated usebrings combat escorts into play and only rewards active players
as long as theres a 90 agility penalty and the module costs as much as an orca sure whatever
try blockade runners once in a while otherwise dont haul a large amount of valuable stuff in a 100k isk cardboard bax with engines
wouldnt do any good at all gankers would just send a pre attacker in to get you to activate mod and pointgank you properly 30 secs later
this would only stop high sec ganking and im a big fan of high sec gankingeditwait why dont you slap on some shield extenders and some hardeners maybe get all screwy and put a rack of ecm or sensor dampeners in the mids
supportits either that or invalidate insurance payouts on illegal activity what happens here in the uk  if you park on a doubleyellow line and have an accident the insurance wont pay up cause you parked illegallyas for the sending someone in to aggress beforehand point there is one dynamic that mitigates the risk  the fact that concord has now swarmed the area so the second wave will have more troublesounds kinda cheeky and fun i like it
theres this class of indys called transport ships i hear they are hard to crack under pressurenot supported
i will support this idea of a super tank module if we also have a tank buster module 1 shot with a 5 minute reload and the shell auto alphas anything smaller than a battleshipi reckon that would just about balance it see what i did there
believe it or not you can go work for the mining corps in eve and they give you the suckiest of mining missions where there are virtually no rats of any value and ores which cant be bought or sold to anywhere elsetheres not even a random massive sellable asteroid the equivalent to a faction drop in any of the missionsthey are a waste of oxygenremove this rubbish from eve or make it fun either is a positive outcome
yes pleasei love to mine but i decline all these pointless worthless missions because nearly anything else i can do in eve short of afk mining in lowsec is more entertaining and profitable
the purpose of mining missions was to allow miners to get lp im not a miner myself so i dont know how well this works but is it not living up to thatedit it seems that theyre not ill support this
i have seen aot of those missions lvl 3 and 4s they involve going to an asteroid giving it half a cycle and coming back and getting you reward of few thousand isk saying they need improvment is like not saying anything they need alot of improvements few ideasthey provide minerals normally not found in highsecthey make you mine an aasteroid guarded by rogue drones meaning you need to first kill rats then mine some rly rair minerals really an imaginary mineral that cannot be sold on the market and then bringing it to the agent for some good pay pay has to be good as mining in this case does not make any money and the rogue drones dont drop muchnotice that main point is mining not strong rats ie drones must be easy to kill for noncombat character not like current lvl 4s but easier
teadaze whole argue can be summarized into i paid good money for my garage alt and you arent going to make me look like a tool by making it obseleteabsolutely supported of all the idiotic uses of pos bowling and all the crap unpreventable theft there is just no sane reason to ever leave it in a pos ever i cant even believe this guy can sit there and say not being able to leave the ship ever is a required handicap to its combat ability
ok  i ought to really give you some credit back forums posts are tricky enough to make decisions from but you are clearly showing that you take your position seriouslyi dont know what the answer to this is  you are damned if you post in a discussion or you will be called apathetic if you do notyou are quite right to point out that this thread has not attracted that much support that is because it has degenerated into a mudslinging thread ill stick to my view  somebody should really start a proper thread on supercapital anchoring a proposal rather than make it easier to play with a whine then well see who supports it and who doesnt
if you are going to summarize my position please do so accurately instead of trying to put words into my mouthas i have stated previously i dont have and never have had a supercapital i have a carrier pilot who like most carrier pilots could fly a supercarrier it doesnt require anything special just needs racial carrier level 3  not even 4 or 5 requiredso at this point one group of people say i shouldnt be commenting on this because i dont have one already and another group complain i couldnt possibly be arguing against it unless i haveput that to one side why dont i have a supercarrier simple i dont want to have that pilot stuck inside the ship because i use him for other things this along with the cost vs usage i would get means i decide not to buy a supercarrier the restrictions are working as intended for me and im sure many other peoplelets look at supercarrier ownership needs a carrier pilot with racial carrier 3 lots of those in game needs 1520 billion isk significant but totally achievable for many of those carrier pilots requires the pilot to sit in the ship at all times or leave it unattended at a friendly pos this is one thing that puts me and op offnow if i was in an alliance throwing capitals around everyday then that third restriction wouldnt stop me owning one because i would have a reason to use it everyday agony dont throw caps around everyday so for me another negative is how little use it would get meaning it would need to be parked most of the timenow in the ops world where you can park your supercarrier in a pos and have it sit there 100 safe without any further interaction that third restriction vanishes now any casual player with a carrier pilot and some isk can own a supercarrier that is something i feel would be terrible for the game some people sidestep the issue with either garage alts or more commonly in my experience have a second combat pilot is it cheating op thinks so and i respect his position i wont use a garage alt either because i have enough alts already thanks and dont want another one  many people do but it is their choice and not a requirementi simply dont agree that ccp are forcing people to have an alt which was the crux of the ops argument for changing the rules firstly i was under the impression that pos bowling was patched out over a year ago and anything left in the pos shield isnt safe no matter what value it has i dont see why supercapitals should be safe at a pos when other ships are notsecondly you can argue that point all you like but it is one of the restrictions that ccp decided was appropriate im simply saying i dont see a compelling reason to make supercapitals easier to own i am however just one of nine on the csm and i dont speak for the rest of them it is entirely possible such a proposal would pass without my voterather than trying to attack me or misrepresent my position why not support the proposal the op raised and encourage other people to as well if enough support is achieved then it will end up in front of the csm i wont support it but there are 78 others who might
it is not like there were no ideas on the table  quit that focus on issue submissions which never get implemented do not stop the assembly hall and associated procedure but stop doing only that the csm should be used as a player think tank where ccp inputs topic that they are actually working on this is what csm3 had prominently discussed with ccp and zastrow wrote an emotional pledge in the csm3s dev bloghaving the csm discuss issues which are on ccps agenda will increase the impact which the csm can do on actual development instead of bombarding ccp with player submitted issues that are totally off limits and out of focus of current developmentccp does not neglect the players nor the csm it is simply that the topics brought up by the csm are  more often than not  too far away from ccps legitimate autonomy in the games development having ccp input open questions into the csm will bring the csm closer to actual development in turn the csms anwers will have a higher chance of making a differencei admit such a scheme may entail keeping more topics under nda and the regular csm meeting minutes may have to undergo review by ccp before publishinglets see this diagramme ccps current development focus and csms player submitted issues  in average  have a certain distance ccps current developmentccp  csm csms new ideasthis distance needs to be briged in order to make a difference on ccps development else csms input will simply go to the backlog and priority changes in the backlog are hard to display to the general public xhagen affirms over and over again that such changes do happen but rediscussing present issues does require a lot of patience by the player public and there is simply no process yet to rediscuss items once submitted by the csm when they go into developmentnow the sum of all the csms procedures does result in a certain influencial force on ccp these procedures are  the item submissions and resubmissions and reresubmissions on the assembly hall which are submitted to ccp via meetings the faith of ccp into the csm which is constantly growing live discussion with ccp in online meetings and on iceland iceland has the biggest impactthe strength of csms influence as a sum of the above can be visualized like this f ccp has a will to change its mind and include ideas and aspects i call them ideas and aspects rather than new issues brought up by the csm it can be visualized like this w if you now overlap the distance between ccps and the csms focus with the force of csms push and ccps will to change you get this ccp  csm w   fyou clearly see the gap which remains whining will not close that gap instead of only relying on csms new ideas brought up by players on the assembly hall we will now look at the current development plan of ccp and pick items from that queue which are under scrutiny we will call them sbi as in sprint backlog item those of you who have followed ccps demonstration of their development method which is scrum have heard of that subprocess defined by the method sprint backlog items are still not implemented and may fail but they are considerably closer to reality because they are features chosen from the huge product backlog that shall be implemented ccp  sbigo ahead and overlay csms strength with that distance and you see ccp  sbi w   fthey meet as a clear result  ccp must give the csm items from their current sprint backlogs for discussion
edited for grammarif you go further on that willandforce idea you will have to consider two modfications to the last diagramme for the following reasons  csms force will be smaller when discussing sprint backlog items because some of them may not be allowed for public discussion on the assembly hall nor a public display at all via minutes that reduces the range of the force f ccps will on the other hand to listen to the csm may be bigger for items which they are working on already they want the development to be  awesome hence player feedback  moreover  feedback from the most dedicated players the game has ever seen  will let this will w growa reduced force f and an increased will w overlayed with the distance of sprint backlog items from reality ccp  sbi w   fstill meet 
you want to give people who are part of the player base access to the sprint backlogs absolutely not do you really want a few select people to know how production requirements on certain items will change in the future say
no kidding wasnt one larkonisgate enough for youuntil there are actual penalties for the misuse of this information and the violation of the nda and im thinking actual civil penalties here not the crap temp bans that were handed down the first time the csm should be kept as far away from upcoming change implementation as possibleyou mention above the communication is only one way  shocker that right since the csm has demonstrated its inability to use the information they do get in a responsible manner why the hell should ccp give them more
your assuming that im throwing a fit over the communications pipeline between ccp and csmim noti have a problem with aholes who get off scott free breaking ndas and csm people who push there own private agendas by totally ignoring the peopleyou assumption that csm people automatically give a  about us is falseof course not all csm are like that but im getting tired of a total and complete lack of accountability for there purpose herethere needs to be a change that proves to use that the csm are unbiased willing to work for the community who gives a fly crap what there alliances want or what the csm cannidate in question wants they serve us like it or not thats there jobthis isnt a instant fanfest contest trip to iceland thats just for grinsyet some csm members have been quoted saying such things repeatedlythese little things are what turns people off about the csm and cause the ever rising population of people who either dont care or would rather see it shut downdamn straight im bitter i love this game enough to growl a bit louder
it seems the penalty for breaking nda isnt in line with the seriousness but that is up to ccp to fix there is also a lack of accountability for not turning up to meetings which again ccp need to look aton the subject of private agendas part of the problem there is the laughably high level of support required for a proposal to be put in front of the csm without a csm rep picking it up in the first place csm reps will naturally pick up topics they agree with or have experience of because there are limited spots for each meetingi cant comment for other reps but i actually attempt to interact with the rest of the playerbase doesnt seem to be working out so well for me so far im not quite sure what measure of accountability you want csm reps not turning up to meetings without good reasons  that needs ccp to get tougher with csm reps breaking nda  that is also up to ccp to deal with because the nda contract is between them and the rep csm reps disagreeing with proposals or which never reach the required level of support  what exactly do you suggest herepart of the issue is the csm cant do much to an individual rep and it is down to ccp to deal with themthere is a fundamental flaw in your argument here1 you assume that anyone from an alliance is only voting for their alliance interests which are not for the common good2 you assume that anyone not in an alliance will only vote for the common good3 you assume that anyone in eve can be unbiased towards their in game playstyle or experienceshow do you propose to stop bias the current system seems to create a council of representatives from a number of different playstyles but that comes down to the public vote and cant currently be controlled by ccplets assume you have two people in noob corps one person supports suicide ganking the other doesnt a proposal is raised to outlaw it one supports the other doesnt is that bias bad are csm supposed to pass any proposal raised without discussion of the possible outcomes at that point all that happens is a counter proposal is raised and that is passed as well now you have two proposals one to outlaw suicide ganking and one to support it ccp then ignore the whole subject and nobody gains anything it becomes a huge waste of timethe point of the csm is to filter the player requests and pass the most important to ccp who are then free to ignore them if they so choose there is an element of personal opinion on the decisions but that is fine because the council represent multiple playstylesi keep forgetting about fanfest afaik no current csm reps have said they only ran for a free trip to iceland but i agree that there was some epic level trolling in the past which has put some players off the whole csm concepti am attempting to show there are still people who do take the responsibility more seriously
im going to assume for the sake of this discussionargument that your completely unaware of the history behind my statements if that is the case then im a little disapointed in your supposed proclaimed experinced in the many areas of eve onlineone of the things i tend to assume yes that might be a mistake is you are aware of what the csm is historically and its actions to be sure1 the nda  your correct but its not seems it is that is something you need to bring up there is an overwhelming opinion that lark should have been permanently banned the fact he wasnt sets a precedent that implies that the csm tend to think they are above the law so to speak and can get away unscathed minus whatever punishment ccp employs point and case larknow i have nothing against lark other than the fact hes just the type of personality i dont get along with i respect his skills i respect his driving force being that he is a pirate and eve requires a balance of all aspects to be great as it is what i dont respect is the bravado he reflects and the fanboi club that continue to downplay it like it was nothing major and he was just keeping in line with piracy real life is not eve online to mix them and use it as an excuse is poor yes he fessed up yes he apologized but thats not enough never will be and personally i get the sneaking suspicion he will be back in the csm in some form or fashion and that really es me off otherwise i wouldnt think much of it and let it go aside from making damn sure history records correctlybut am i ccp no but i take ndascontracts seriously in my line of work you dont  around with that and he should have been taught that a little more harhsly imho we have to live with it why the hell cant heoverall this makes the csm look horrid and as such invokes a lack of confidence due to the lack of action in taking steps to prevent such repeats such as encouraging ccp to be a little more harsh in its punishment if anything it makes the csm look like its responding appropriate instead of just standing around and saying things2 your assuming im in line with the crowd on this area im notif you knew your history youd see that there have been occasions where the csm choseignored valid proposals and or decisions that or completely dropped the ball on communication with the peoplesuch examples are frequent and legitimate requests for meeting minutes excused by silence or oh we cant talk about that i realize some things can be mentioned but telling me if my proposed skill queue alternation passed would harldy be considered an earth shattering feat that would break the game as we know it due to its hush hush secrecy im sure i speak for everyone who have had proposals passed up that didnt get feedback until months later if at allproposals brought by csm passed by csm voted down by the people this is outrageous and disgusting that was one of the most insulting actions of the csm todate your job is to listen to weighin and to bring forth proposals that are legitimately supported ignoring proposals that are passed up with very minimal support is stupid and begging to get your heads blown off in a political fashion it only takes 1 singular incident to do that and it happened now we have zero confidence in what the csm really is and just how legitimate your motives areyes your not the representative responsible i get that but you have a voice and you can saydo something about itthe representatives at the time said nothing and didnt bother to point it out they just voted it up and that was the final nail in the coffin and that was published in the minutes to bootmore to come
continuedthere are proposals that are foolish and ridiculous mob mentalities and while im happy to see they are ignored this is also an inherently dangerous problem you cant be a democractic platform and ignore your peopleno matter how foolish or stupid they are i can protest all i want but i am one voiceif they support enmasse then you are bound to pass it up and vote on it vote it down its legit and honestly people need to see that to get it through there thick skulls its not going to happen such as ghost trainingsaying it was proposed and passed up is stupid you should link history insteadshowing a record with minutes to make the point clear ccp said nopeople are not going to search for the proof in the pudding if you dont bother to give them a damn bowel to put it in3 the flaw in my argument over bias is not mine the flaw lies in human nature its a veiled statementi mean lets be serious the usas government has politicians who claim to be for the people but everyone knows they have there own bias and agenda you can never achieve true biasbut you can sure as hell make it hard on them to do anything outright the bulk of the population in csm are elected by alliances of a large population that or those who have large swaths of gangs who happen to agree on one point take care party yucki realize this is a game but the csm should treat this seriously and with a driving force to be determined to make it better one way or anotherso when i ask for a csm that is unbiased and that gives a damn im talking about people who actaully participate frequently who post frequently here people who are willing to talk people who keep balance and a nuetural position instead of taking sides when its a little to obvious they have there own firm opinionexample you used one supports suicide ganking the other doesntwhen someone proposes to remove insurance for getting concordd there is a major difference in coming up with some amania excuse such as economics and no csm hasnt said that yet and someone who takes the time to explain the mechanics and weighs things out statisticlyworse yet saying deal with it high sec is supposed to be safe not safer is a poor responsethats our job even mine even to troll and be stupidyour job is to be a mediator and to weigh things outyour debate with the supercaps you dont fly one people know that yet you passionately arguewhy your no expert you only know what you hear see understand you stand to lose more respect than i would by arguing your out of your bloody mindbut we both know its just an opinion but your more public than i am people will shoot you first before they shoot me as im just a noobyour csmif you took the time to talk to the super cap pilots and ask them how they felt about this you would likely change your opinion a little bit if not have an understanding and respect the fact they sufferinstead your focusing on ccps supposed stance or your fear of proliferation of super caps sprouting up like rabbitsor maybe your side of the coin is entirely different fact is most csm doesnt go that farat least your civil enough to discuss to a point that ill give you4 as to the fanfest funny how you said current of course there wouldnt be thats the next csm not to mention previous i suggest you take the time to think about that before respondingbottom line is this you have a serious problem here and its not what you initially thought it wassolution starts with you and its not an easy one due to the holes dug in due to previous actionsno its not likely your fault but its a mess you have to clean up
yes it is this is wowas for the rest of your post i dont think you know what it would be like but if you dont want to go in the arena you wouldnt have tountil your last sentence i thought you were describing eve in general so this will be like everything else in eve whats wrong with that but really you are wrong in your predictions
i like the concept i think that a balancing system could be used perhaps base it on isk value of the ship your flying a 6 million isk crusier no chance of going up against a 100 million isk hac i like pvp but i have found that the vast magority of the time its overwheming odds either way and not at all saticfying
anything that removes fleets of s from outside stations has to be good
the point is you dontthe ndacontractual agreement is legally binding obviously you dont act on any insider information no matter the excuseyou tempt fate like that and you get shot in the its not that hard to figure out apparently it is for some people
are the contracts that ccp employees and the csm sign in this regard public id be curious what the actual clause said are ccp employees bound by terms at least as strong as those they hold csm toyeah they can prove he bought such and such items but how can they prove what his motivation was i doubt larconis really had any legal analysis of his position i think he didnt think his actions were justified under his contract didnt want to lie about it so he did the right thing of course purposely violating an agreement is not the right thing but after he did that and he was questioned about it he seemed to have done the right thing also my questions are still unanswered would you say from my hypothetical the person would have to buy all the warp core stabilizers or be in breach of contract
not supportedlarkonis admitted that he screwed up he lost the medal if ccp wishes to remove his name from the wiki so be it he shouldnt have screwed up if he wanted to keep his status medal and wiki mention he took a flight to iceland had a chance to meet with the devs all on ccps dime its his own fault if he couldnt keep it togetheras for the unanswered question above it remains unanswered because its irrelivant going to do  did
iceland may well have different laws but contracts such as this in the us the uk and canada which are the kind ive seensigned are not public they are a private binding agreement between parties the person agreeing signs it and both sides keep a copythe reason for the privacy is that sometimes the terms themselves may contain references to trade secrets etcbtw  contracts of this sort arent always very nice theres a big debate over a woman who was sexually assaulted by fellow employees in iraq and because of her contract cannot sue or even file a legal complaint needless to say its being fought in court as to whether that is a legal agreementmotivation isnt relevant legally here just the fact that the info was publicly revealed if youre given a document under nda and accidentally leave it on a table in a mall youre still guilty of violation even if you didnt mean to also in civil court at least in the common law system  i think iceland uses a different one but not certain the standard of proof is different from criminal cases only 51 at fault in a common law system needs to be proven in civil or contract lawthe fact that a change to item x was in the meeting minutes and then a csm went out and boughtsold item x in large quantity would almost certainly be more than sufficient for most juries out of such questions are lawyers fortunes made in iceland i dont know in north america youd just have to convince a jury that there was more than 51 blameintent which i think most decent lawyers probably could do but even lawyers can stuff up a caseremember that few nda violations ever see a courtroom either usually its just a nice legal way to turf the person very hardas to ccps employees again i dont know icelands laws in north america sometimes contracts are signed and sometimes they arent and whats on them can be anything from very mellow to ridiculous see the assault case above for instance most benefit the employers far more than the employees unless the employee has a highly unusual amount of bargaining powerccp might not even have contracts for their employees my company doesnt for many of their salaried people and just rely on icelandic labour laws and who knows what they are
dont change history books but revoking his shiny medal is fineno support
no in both the unanswered question and what larkonis did the person did take unfair advantage as compared to other players of information he obtained from being on the csmif you get teh medal for being elected to the csm he should have his medal if you get a medal for successfully serving a full term on the csm he should not have ever gottne the medal in the first place
jarvisyour comments they are pretty well thought out assuming your not a lawyeron the larkonis case motivation or some similar term depending on the contract language is important people in csm can make trades and continue to play eve afaik so its 
if someone didnt know the whole story and only read your side one would think injustice was committed against this larkonis character but there is a whole other side to this story a really ugly side that pretty much would put this thread to end once and for all the exception to this being the hardcore larkonis fanbois that would support his doings no matter what they were
youre right a better analogy would be to a celebrity getting his corporate sponsorship pulled because a video surfaced of him smoking a bong while performing sinful acts with a donkey this saga has been very interesting and why anyone would want to get this erased from the wiki is beyond me
fascinating tell us more about the other csm members who were caught acting on this information because they were powerless to resist their greed
free lark gob
although larkonis did make a scandal he was still a member of the csm and it should be reflected as such give him a custom dishonored medal or something
free larkonis
my idea pilot joins concord similar to the way a pilot joins a faction militanow when a concord offence takes place the pilot gets a distress becon on the overview and has the ability to warp to the distress beacon as well as the ability to open fire on the offending ships player gets lp for kills inflicted on those with active gcc or with flashy red sec status concorde ships become flyable with skills purchased from lp store depending on stats they may need to be tuned down a bit to bring in line with current prat faction ships or leave the stats current but keep the cost of lp stupid high preventinting abuse of the ships this of course would be done mostly in low sec with some anti suicide ganking taking place
sounds like they need you in highsec during hulkageddon mr police officeron another note to make your life interesting wardecs should be an illegal activity in 08 systems but thats a whole different flame thread hahaid join the police if they backed me upi was surprised when i joined the game that doing missions for the navy didnt mean i was ranked in the navy etc and that concord couldnt be joined supported
this is the funniest thing i have read in monthspreventing abuse of these shipsyou have no idea what youre talking about or the capabilities of the ships that concord flies do you

a breakthrough in recent technological developments funded by a gallente drone billionaire has now paved the way for production of heavy mining drone i and ii variantsthe goal of the project was to allow industrial command and capital ships to not just be a passive bystander in the mining operation alongside this a module has been developed intrinsic attribute to the orca and rorqual that allows these monster mining drones to use minimal bandwidththe pilots of these ships at the level ii versions should see throughputs of 1500m3m which is above normal strip miner capacity but under t2 modulated capacity with a highly skilled pilot
is it pc to support yourself
you want an orca to mine as hard as a hulk no thanks rorqs maybe though even then theres got to be better options but not on orcas also supporting yourself is common enough but i tend to prefer waiting a bit so i can reply to a post that disagrees with me and put my thumb there instead of in the second post on the thread

stated from the ccp reimbursement pagelosses caused due to disconnection as a direct result of a server node drop or an unannounced server downtime may be reimbursed pending investigation by and at the discretion of a gm ships lost due to lag or nonserver related disconnection will not be reimbursedlag id like a definition of what ccp refer to as laga small time delay in your actions  sure i guess thats more than acceptable in alot of situations even a more lenghy time delay say upto a minute yes i guess that would be conciderd more of a severe lag but i mean as long as you still have a little bit of time to send an action and wait for it to receive  activate turn on a modual mwd repper hardner etc or even attemp to guide your ship in a general direction such as a stargate either towards or away from or even try to warp out i do agree as long as you have options such as these regardless if their is a small or large time delay you still have a relivate control over your vessel  pod thus having the options to make a decision to defend yourself or try to escape death this i do belive does not deserve reimbursementaltho when you are caught up in something more extreme as in you try to enter a grid  system and nothing happens for 30 minutes and i mean nothing you cannot see celestial objects such as planets or moons brackets that resemble something such as an asteroid belts star gates or anything that you would normally see and i do mean see nothing overview showed the words nothing found you cannot see your friends or your foes or even your own ship for that matter im talking about a completely blank screen for more than 30 minutes and in alot of cases even more than that it is ludicrous to think that ccp can lable this kind of problem as a form lagnow when you experince this you may aswell concider yourself already dead with no options dead you cannot do anything to try to defend yourself in any way as i stated in the first paragraph if you can do these things as in having even the slightest control i do belive thats a case of lag and no reimbursement should be given altho if you experince what i describe in paragraph 2 i would call it a bug or failure rather than what ccp refer to it as a lag then in this case i do belive you should be intitled to a reimbursementif you petition your loss under these conditions ccp will most likeley reply with the messageit is impossible for us to measure how much lag each person has and even harder to verify which losses were the result of lag and which losses were legitimate reimbursing losses from large battles due to possible lag which is unverifiable from our end would in essence mean removing the risk of loss from fleet battles entirely and thereby nullify their whole purpose i am sorry that we cannot assist you and i hope you understand our stance on this matterand i can completely understand that but this bit which is unverifiable from our end i do disagree with this as far as i know ccp have recorded logs of all actions made by players because every player has his  her own unique id and with this im more than sure ccp have a method of filtering out a single persons actions and viewing that one log and every aciton that person has made in doing this you should beable to see for example what time the person enterd the system for example lets say on the log it says 210433 the time the made that action and lets say no other actions were made for 8 minutes or so then they look at the recoded log and it shows a ship destruction at 211233 an 8 minute gap with absolutly no activity what so ever was the person controling the ship just sitting there making no actions no attempt to save himher self from the aggressor common sense tells us that this person was totaly unable to do anyhitng and most likely spent the entire time waiting for something to load this in my opinion
cont from abovedoes deserve a reimbursement just nor another quick example lets say the perosn enters system  grid at 210433 then at 210512 locks a target 210516 activated several moduals 210601 activates a repair modual etc etc these are obvious actions that the player had control over his ship and that that a gm can see this by reading the logsin my opinion latter example of not being able to do anyhitng in any way what so ever deserves a reimbursement because there is no way of doing anyhitng to defend yourself  prevent yourself from being killed and that in my opinion is not fair that is not legitimate game mechanics and your game is not supposed to work like this altho you do advertise like that in promo videos  but this is not about advertisement now before anyone tries to tell me that the issue of frozen screens due to extreme system overloads cannot be fixed just like that i do understand the soloution of solving this problem is a very hard one and will take alot of time and dedication untill ccp can reahc an acceptable level this is nothing to do with the lag  freezing problem this is to do with ccp refusing to reimburse under these conditions which is wrong especially since we are paying customers this is in no way how it should be alot of people say just relax take some time calm down get yourself back out there and get a new ship  fittings and try again next time no not everyone has the spare time to play this game long enough to do such things lets say you only have a few hours spare a week to play you spend 9 months scrapping the isk together to buy a nice ship in my personal case it was a 18 billion isk dreadnaught and all is lost due to this horirble factor and ccp just say no we cant tell if its legit or not this is totaly out of order saying just go get another one you should be putting the time and effort into these petitions and investigating the logs to try to prove if a ship was a legit loss or not no one should have to do all the work over if they lost there ship in this wayin my opinion ccp are extremely happy just to say to us no reimbursement go do the work all over again aslong as we continue to pay subscriptions well ccp you are out of order to say that untill you have fixed the freezes in big fights you should be putting the time and effort into each petition and look at the facts statistics and logs and then try to judge if it was legit or not rather than just copy and paste the same useless message over and over that no one wants to hear we pay you to do your job so why dont you start putting some effort in and do your job
or they mashed jump and then got up to go the bathroom and got popped while they were having a how is ccp supposed to know which
the only time these instances ocour is when large fleet warefare happens and when you are in large fleet warfare and you just tried to enter the fight you dont go and have a  common sense will tell you this and hopefully ccp will start reading their logs in more depth to try and figure out which are real or not
i love assumption based proposals make for a good laughoh and i dont deny the problem but your assuming a great deal herenot supporting
the only thing i really assumed is that ccp have recorded logs of all acitons made but it owuld make no sense if they did not every player that makes an action is recorded via that players unique id for example that id looks somehting likeplayer namel  burlshowinfo13731173009641splayer nameurlbthe long number is the player id and as far as i know ccp can just find all logs made by that player hence judging if they player was active during the time of his loss or not
lag is a well known phenomenon amongst the player base and its effects are pretty well documented if you are not compos mentis enough to realise that jumping 200 capitals into an already strained system with around 800 in system and already loaded is going to end in tears then you should probably try a simpler game like pongeverybody knows about lag and if you are deliberately exposing yourself to such a situation then you deserve all you get
this definetly needs to be classified as bug and something should be implemented to avoid thiseasiest thing would be to just make invulnerable all ships entering system jumping in  entering game until they succesfully load system as long as they are in progress of loading they cannot be targeted  same as players who initiated warp cannot be locked as soon as they enter system appriopriate message is sent to server and ship is valid target for attacks
we only tryed top play the dominiontrailer something went wrong
so what you are trying to say is the way sov wareware should be played is first in system wins  i do argee with the player sbeing invunerable untill fully loaded sounds like a fairly good idea at least that way you have a chance
people are looking at this the wrong waywhat ccp should realize is that they are reaching a limit ever noticed how problems starts to show in various regions accros the server when it gets over 50k user count  yet despite this ccp continues to market their game as much as possible just look at the dominion changes and the dominion trailer ccp markets and encourages 00 wars yet if you attempt the real thing the server falls over time and time again00 wars are really simple now because of these problems 1st one in with numbers wins the systemthis problem can only get worse as the player base grows and it willmore and more petitions will plague ccp as their customers tries to enjoy eve but cant because of ever growing problems that affects everyone at oncethink of it as a small town that crew into a citythen think of those narrow roads that once worked perfectly in the past but is now gridlockedccp helmar you know what im talking about i watched you in some promotional video during the alliance tournament where you talked about how eve outgrew far beyond what you imagined you gave us something great and every eve player thanks you for it as you bring us hours of entertainment lets keep it that waydont be too quick to put the blame on blob wars its something that will happen when your defending or attacking a system you go in with forceif ccp refuses to address these petitions then i ask that they atleast tell us how hard they are working behind the scenes on a codinghardware levelto concludei love the dominion changes i really do the new planets and features are awesome and i mean it but you must remember you cant continue to construct new levels on a building without reinforcing its foundation
no what im saying is that there are known problems with dominion also from my understanding about that particular engagement you were already in system but chose to give up that advantage by ragejumping out i digress caod  that way if you want to fight in these conditions then you have to accept the consequences of doing so there are also several methods and workarounds for combating particularly nasty and laggy gridsystem loading issuesim not saying its perfect but if you are deliberately exposing yourself to these conditions then you should not have your ship reimbursed ive died to lag a couple of times without getting a shot off its frustrating but i took it on the chin and realised that i knew what i was getting into
for once i agree with larkputting yourself in harms way for the sake of emoraging over a problem is beating a dead horseyes we know theres a problem get back in line along with the other hundreds of complaintsccp will get to it when they will get to itdemanding reimbursement is just adding insult to injury
not supportedafter atlas vs wi plgoons vs it in y2 you pulled that stuntiirc pl didnt get their titans reimbursed eitherjust in case you want to try the stunt again maybe talk to nc how to cyno in a fleet without blackscreening and dying
not that i disagree as such but a better solution is for ccp to figure whatever they did to break the servers in the dominion patch and undo it so that we can have semiplayable fights in the first placeits not like ccp can reimburse the hours of our lives we all spend staring at a black screen which is arguably more valuable than our pretend dead internet spaceships anyway
currently there exists no way to export the status of blueprints in your hangars you can get a list of which blueprints they are but not if they are originals copies or their meperun levels it would be very database intensive to offer this information in a regular apii would propose that ccp offer create a new api that would be created and cached for every player and corporation in a downtime once per month the 15th for example players could retrieve the api anytime but it would show their blueprint status as of the previous 15th of the month while it would be useful to have available much more frequently this would also generate a significant database load having it available once per month is a balance of usefuldatabase load people and corporations can still import the bulk of their blueprint library and manually update the important parts until the next months update
try evehqshould be some nice features there for thatif not carry on
as i stated originally currently the api just lists the blueprints you have and no further information nothing about me pe original or copy or runs eve hq can try to match up some information when you install a job can the api does show the full information for running jobs but installing hundreds of jobs just to get blueprint information is rather tedious additionally it doesnt guarantee a firm match even then because the ids it uses from the api pull can change with each pull
i dont know just how serverintensive it would be but im in favour of this proposal if its the best ccp will do half a bp api is better than no api at all
i pretty much support anything making the api better
not supportedthe way ive always seen it unguided missiles were for taking out stuff bigger than yourself so rockets were for taking out cruisers hams for bs and torps were for caps and above ive always thought this was the justification for their higher damageat best they should be used for taking out something of the same size when lit up with a whole bunch of tp
what higher damageas turret ships does more dmg against bigger enemies show me that higher damage plsthen they should do as much dmg as the class they are fighting against
i dont like modules like shipcargo scanners which have no counter supported
i try to run multiple missionssometimes from multiple stations like most players i do need to decline a mission for one reason or another from time to timemostly i decline to try to keep my standings between states balancedwhich is a lot harder than i originally thought but this point is for another proposalcurrently i keep tabs on my declinations with pad and penmy proposalan info bubble forms when the mouse pointer is over an agents namebubble only forms over agents with an active declinationbubble only shows countdown of time left on the 4 hour decline timer yes we can track this ourselves but when you add in multiple missions multiple stations and multiple toons it gets quite hecticpeacehp

simple nice improvementi like it
good idea a ui improvement is always welcome
seems reasonable
sure
the topic basically states it allplease move the rigging skills out of mechanic and into their own subsection in the skilltreewould clean things up alot and probably isnt all that hard to do  even though i have no clue as how things are implemented 
aside from the it makes my character sheet look ugly argument what else do you have that ones not convincing anyone
theres like a dozen rank 1 rigging skills i see no need for this
since insurance is purchased in game for ships why not have an option to buy it for cargo that way when moving an expensive cargo you can insure it against loss by all the high sec gank squads
there is its called collateralyes i know thats not what your asking forbut your not going to get what your asking fortheres no real point to insure cargo that is not likely going to be there for longif your worried about shipping something valuable in any area you should hire someone to do it for you and put collateral on itthat way if they do get hit you get paid backproblem with that being a hauler myself collateral sucks assso yeah welcome to eve online
a game mechanic for cargo insurance would be trivial to defraud its extent would dwarf the insurance fraud on t1 ships the perpetrators would keep the cargo and gain an insurance payout therefore it would be a massive isk source and lead to isk hyperinflation
this
way to take it offtopic helghast the discussion is on gate guns not pos guns gates are far more likely to be battlegrounds than poses and poses have the guns there mainly as a defence for the automated structure not the players
seriosuly people the point is to encourage population growth in 00 gate guns help with thatnothing is to stop a 35 drake gang from flying in the front door to wreck some havocwhats the big dealeven a small little t1 gang is going to suffer when they slam into a bubble camp with carriers and hacsthis is a proverbial drop in the pond ripples would be nothing to fret over your pvp hunger
the only things gate guns would provide would be the ability for the people inhabiting the systems to become lax you know what laxness in a highrisk environment doesalso nice of you to mention a bubblecamp with carriers and hacs it seems youve never been to 00 hacs and carriers would do nothing to stop a roaming frigate gang but these turrets would adapt to your aggressors to take them out and stop relying on automated defenses in a game that tries to make its players do everything themselves
as a free pilot in free space i do not support this proposal small roaming groups and solo ships need to remain viable even at gates
defences already exist for your systems in the form of friendly gangs if you are unable to secure your own systems from intruders then you dont deserve it this proposal would help to eliminate solo and small gang roaming and encourage blobbing
you do realise that if guns are on gates you can atempt attacking people away from gates could be a through not alll fights need to happen at system gates or atleast not in turret optimal which is small for small gangsif hacs cannot stop a frigate roam then how will a pos gun with worse tracking and slower locktime then that of a hac doif you are unhappy about the guns blow them up this will be the beginning to destructible infrastructure that alliences have to maintain and repair
they cant camp a gate anymore and the situation is worse than in lowsec  there the gate guns only shoot them with gcc in 00 the guns would already fire for not being blue
if 00 was magically changed to wormhole space i think alot of problems would be solved you wouldnt be able to amass 5 alliances and 1000 during the time frame a system is open to yours your tactics would be to scoutassess and be fighting in less than an hour once a beach head was established slowly reinforcements would arrive it would be actually be a fight not the craptastic blob they are now it would be much better but someone long ago said epic battles  1000
terribly misspelled but qft i believe suicide ganking as it stands is too easy but i prefer to seperate convenience mechanics from balancing mechanics and the op is a convenience mechanic
esp view available contracts everywhere
as all ui improvements this is a good idea
ok then i want a mid slot module that gives me perfect tracking for my turrets aka always hit target mid slot because it wont interfere with my armour tanking modulescorrect me if im wrong but i seem to remember that ccp actually nerfed missiles a while back might be two years ago i really cant remember to honest why did ccp do that hers a pro tip for you guys they where overpowered and no they are not underpowered compared to turrets and yes i fly both missile and turret boats so i know
not only are you wrong but you are dead wrong ccp nozh adjusted missiles with quantum rise because the way missile tracking worked was faulty in addition to the fact that he and zulupark removed speed as a legitimate tactic for ships larger than a frigate the problem is that he replaced the significantly flawed missile tracking method with another significantly flawed missile tracking mechanic missiles were not overpowered before qr except torps they are not underpowered now eitherexcept rockets and lights well they wouldnt be if only nozh didnt do a halfassed job on rebalancing missiles and speed and i was here for 35 years so i know why i knowedit as for the topic the problem of 30 second delay can easily be solved by fixing the frikkin missile skills and addressing the fact that 3750ms is ridiculously slow for zerog propulsion for such a small mass
im for anything that makes caldari ships aside from ew which are already quite good more viable in pvp i started out caldari but have since been forced to crosstrain to be viable in pvp
implement fleet engagement launcher chargesbasically missiles that work like a turret ultrafast good range instant damage explosionvelocities of the torpedos and e dps to compensate for the nonexistant tracking issue
just to clarify im not suggesting breaking petitions down by gm name merely satisfaction across the userbase 
you want that information then go build a website and run a pollyour wasting your time to what end what would it gain justification over some subtle fact or theoryccp is a business that chooses to do as they please even if the csm brought this forward i seriously doubt this they are likely going to be told no regardless of how loud you complainid be more interested in bug reports and statistics over fixes in the gameat least that is far more useful to the public than what your asking for
straight up i support the structures being player made i also support pos being player made
imo hybrids altogether are in need of an overhaul of some form
these numbers are crap two using t2 ammo two using t1 when exactly did that become a fair comparison
no support for this it is far too widespread of a change and could seriously unbalance ships come back with a better more specific proposal and do fair comparisons amongst the ships
thanks for your insightfull input care to elaborateeagle uses t1 ammo by default because it is designed to do so if you are using spike with eagle  i cant say anything to make you see the truth you are right though i should use tremor with munnin since all hacs have roughly 110120 km targeting range and you are fighting aligned it means that your targets are 70100km awaytherefore i was focusing on the 80km optimaltactical range to get dps and alpha if you include fallof for each hac youll see that they can hit beyond targeting range shooting further away than 110 kms is rarely encountered thoughthese numbers are calculated with a 15 increase to rails damage modifier and a 10 pg increase to the eagle included to demonstrate what this proposal is all aboutmunnin 195k ehpt2 720mm arties emp m t1  357 80 from drones dps  2936 2949 volley tracking 004482t2 720mm arties tremor t2  238 dps  8122 1966 volley tracking 000945 tremor tracking sucks but lets you fit 3x gyroseagle 195k ehpt2 250mm rails am t1  325 dps  4720 1138 volley tracking 004967t2 250mm rails uranium t1  270 dps  8629 948 volley tracking 003148 only thing eagle has got goingdeimos 20k ehpt2 250mm rails am t1  360 dps 158 drone dps  2337 1345 volley tracking 005101t2 250mm rails spike t2  240 dps  8437 897 volley tracking 000719zealot21k ehpt2 heavy beams multifreq t1  448dps  2310 1110 volley tracking 005362t2 heavy beams aurora t2  299dps  9313 740 volley tracking 001031 highest dps at rangei have to thank those that inputed suggestions about better fits and ammo usage especially those corpmates of mine that provided data for the munnin and deimos fitas an aside deimos is the least range  oriented hac and thus is very difficult to catch up to the rest of the others zealot is the easiest to fit but that is countered by the fact that it has no utility high and cannot fit a cloak and i hear rigs are good to fit and medium ones are really cheap
you do realise that maybe different hacs where designed on different optimal ranges its like comparing dps from blasters and puces at 30km with blaster using iron thats a flawed comparison is eagle does not have a damage mod ofcource it will have lower damage output but grater optimal
you do realise that both zealot and munnin have an optimal range bonus and a damage bonusas for the range fit a munnin with 720mm arties no range mod and load tremor m w a lvl 5 pilot range 8122 how about that for design range i rest my caseat the same time when you compare the current damage potential for these ships you realise that both deimos and eagle lack severely behind being able to hit beyond your targeting range for laughable damage is not a role a hac was meant to fill this proposal is not about hacs i am using them as a focus to represent the fact that rails are lacking as long range weapon systems if you also examine sniper bses youll notice that with the current buff for projectiles rokh hype and mega underperform by the way even 15 increase in damage will not make rail platforms have better dps than amarr it will just let them operate in the same ballpark
responding to all of these because they share the same theme of not wanting rails boosted because of a perception that they will dominate put simply this is not the case for a number of reasonsfor one the idea that rails get range while other weapons systems get damage is a bit of a flawed one as having range only means something if you do top damage at that range since last i checked eve isnt a long ranged ticklecontest this dosent mean you should outpreform shorter ranged weapons systems but it does mean that you have to outpreform their falloff the current iteration only allows a rokh with rails to get peak dps right at the lock limit as displayed here the final peak on the rokh there before the falloff descent is spike at 253km even then it just barely outpreforms the falloff of the tach apoca 5 bump would bring a rokh with 3x magstabs to 337dps with spike over its current 320 comparing that to the 400 an apoc gets is embarrassing doing 20 less damage for 10 more range isnt exactly balanced as it is now and the 5 bump wont change that 20 bump in damage brings the rokh to 385 which is 4 less damage now technically you could argue that the rokhs getting too much range for that sort of damage and id agree if not for the lock limit however so long as thats in place a large portion of the ranges where the rokh with rails would preform best is simply unusable which means to make it useful at all you have to put some pressure on the apocs positiondamage wise the other contender the megathron dosent compete anywhere currently its 350 dps falls 30 km short of the apocs 400 and the 20 boost would bring its damage with spike to 420 5 more damage for 15 less range then the tach apoc even with beams the difference is only 12 more damage for 11 more range almost a perfect exchange of range for damage with the infirior preformer mega beamsnow those that would argue that lasers cost cap and thus should do more damage clearly havent experienced the pain of using a caldari sniper boat as here you can see that once you put them on the apoc the disadvantage evaporates only the abaddon seems to struggle more then the rokh with cap and well its an abaddon it does thatthough admittedly might need to be fixedfinnally if youre asking what the maelstrom gets its alpha and plenty of it which is somewhat niche but still a usable advantagein closing i think rails should get 20 more damage and face 1020 less cap drain given they use ammo and arent meant to be fitted on the biggest pool of cap for battleships the apoclight blue is the rokh red and yellow are beam and tachyon apocs respectively green and grey are beam and tachyon abaddons respectively and the dark blue is a mael other ships not included as they wouldnt achieve a peak above the ships already shown

titans doomsday and stealth bombers can keep the racial damage bonuses but change the helios inquisitor breacher and caldari ships with racial damage bonuses to a flat damage bonus
but but but i also means the racial damage bonus sucks on the hound  other stealth bombers so im gonna do the same as the op did and make a waaaah waaaaah and bawwww and booohooo cry topic so we can have the racial damage bonus removed on stealth bombers for rof bonus or damage bonus instead in the first place and then i will make one topic for the titansthat sounds like a very good idea so there will be no points really to use a purifier for example over a hound a stellar ideayeah you know racial damage bonuses sucks right
do that if you want but you forgot that those are all the same classes  all stealth bombers have the same amount racial dmg bonuses and it is not 5 but 15lvl for the torps and titans can only fit 1 dmg type doomsdays but then look at hac do all hacs only get bonus for their racial dmg type no only the cerberus does that is a huge imbalance right there the matars can use emp and get their full bonus applied to it  they use em type dmg much more effectively than eighter missile caldari or zealotthe ship which race has em as their racial dmg type that makes no senseor phased plasma vs deimos ability to do heat dmgthe projectiles were designed and balanced choosable dmg type in mine so were the missiles but then only projectiles can use this after bonuses applied see totally imbalancedif cerberus can only get bonus for their racial dmg type missiles so should vagabonds only get bonus for fusion mnuclear m only see totally imbalancedso yes racial dmg bonuses sucks if only one race have it in a ship classracial dmg bonus doesnt suck if every race have it for the same ship class like stealth bombers or titans
thats a very flawed logic if you dont know why then i suggest you should get some serious help to really find that outone of the things is that your thinking that because projectiles  other gun weapon types can do that and that then missiles should be able to do the same missiles and turrets are 2 totally different things and should work in 2 totally different ways towell just to let you know the explosive damage bonus on the hound i something i really like and it seems that you didnt take any hints on my reply that you replied to that what i said about creating a topic and whine that omgomg waaaaah please remove the racial damage bonus on the stealt bombers was a jokeit was just to illustrate how stupid it would beand this topic is stupid to and very few are supporting it 57 supports it out of 473 replies yeah this sounds like a good idea so its never gonna happen so this topic can just be closed right nowif this topic have had 400 supports now then it might have been something else and it would mean it would be a problem but its not with 57 supportslike we all say dont fix anything that isnt broken
sounds like youre looking to give lowsec more of a piratey feel but the problem is that no matter how much you spruce up the dark underbelly furniture the fact remains that the entire lifestyle is pointless if lowsec isnt profitable for the empire folk to come down there and make their fortuneget huntedthe key to a populated lowsec is not to make it a better place for pirates but to make it a better place for everyone else who the pirates can then prey uponand here is the especially big kicker carebear mcmissionrunner needs to be able to make so much isk in lowsec that they have a good chance of getting ganked on a semiregular basis and still coming out ahead of empire earnings in short you need to be able to easily pull in 50 milhr in lowsec and since that would destroy the games economy it isnt going to happenempire incentives are just too high for lowsec to compete with all of its risksrealistically eve has the tools to let players solve this problem themelves the problem is that if some corp took it upon themselves to police and tax a lowsec constellation or two in order to grow a rattingtrading population that simply instantly becomes the place to pirate and there are far more people looking to prey upon those trying to build up an economy than there are people to support it the ratio to upstanding citizens trying to build wealth and infrastructure to pirates who just want a piece of someones pie is way too far off to be effectivein short pirates prey on society theyre the seedy underbelly society thrives on social contract theory eves population ignores social contract theory society ceases to exist in lowsec the underbelly has nothing to prey on and ceases to exist lowsec lays barren
incorrect the point isnt about pirates vss non pies its about making lowsec a viable place to live without ing out an empire alt to pay for things mission runners really dont need more places to play the epitome of what they want already exist in high sec this is about the people who dont like high sec and dont like missions and who already want to live in low sec about giving them the means to do so thats all leave the pies vs bears out of this
as above the point isnt to make piarcy easier its to make lowsec a place with some substance wjere the pirates fight each other for dominanice where anit pirate or strong industrials with combat capability can carve out a little turf for themselves for legal or illegal activities it isnt about getting people to visit lowsec to make iskget gamked its abouit aking lowsec a viable place to live with its own politics and culture
on item 3 if things gotten from the lp stores of pirate faction agents where illegal in highsec unless smuggled to a specific type of agents in high sec who can make the item legal after which it can be sold on the normal market in high sec then you have a valid smuggling mechanic that isnt based on npc items that players have no use foron most of the other ideas i have this to say most players who stick to highsec dont do so because the rewards in highsec are higher they do it because they have no interest in getting into pvp action on anyones terms but their own if ever if all the lvl 4 agens where moved into lowsec a lot of missioning highsec players would simply do more lvl 3s and earn less and be very disgrunted but most wont go to lowsec

bump back to front page since this needs to be dealt with
supported overall research could probably use a revamp to make it more of a profession and less of a passive income thing
this was already brought up and solved not sure if it was this thread or a similar one where the question was posed and answered its really not a huge deal the tldr version it wouldnt be necessary to recode anything other then the mechanics you wanted changed the servers can easily be made to tell the difference between bonused ehp and ships ehp
this tbhdid you ever think about the fact that some players just want to jump on for an hour or 2 blow some stuff up then jump off not spend a couple of hours shudders grinding for iskjust because a char is old in the game doesnt mean they have mountains of isk my char is 2 and a half years old and i only sit on 300mil which pvping is all i do and if you have a bad run and die lots then the loses start adding up and next thing you know you are below 100mil
an then you might have to  do something else for a whilethe horrorthat would be likelike a miner having to pvp when they just want to mine some ore how very rude
taking up a slotso basically what youre saying is that older players shouldnt be running around in cheap ships
nah cloning is too cheap as it is dont get me started on jump clones
i fail to see what the op really is proposing so i cant be bothered with this i am not interested in discussing ideas in here
this idea fails at the point it doesnt take in account that living in low sec is not easy and shooting people actually punishes you quite a bitonly thing which might need looking at is hi sec ganking and chaining sec up
i agree with the core concept that high security status should be awarded paying taxes and being a good citizen should provide access to more public empire services currently keeping a high sec status doesnt really matter until you get to the point where youre being punishedperhaps base insurance rates on security status to some degree or decrease empire fees
thats funny looks like a lot of people have no trouble at all
i support because i careplease allow me to take off the blinders
yes
if its ewar enough to get a bonus on a recon ship it should be ewar enough to show up on the overview if you have that option ticked could come in handy
dont care seems like a trivial thing to me
this change would also be useful in pvp where people like me tend to turn off all effects in an effort to reduce lag so i often have no idea if capacitor warfare is being used
yes please
yes please
exactly  now that you mention it  why hasnt this already been done ccp good idea
it has become pretty standard to see engagements with way more than 256 pilots on each side thus hitting the limit of the current fleet hierarchy system while often it is reasonable to split up the forces into multiple fleets it should be possible to have more pilots in one if the fcs so desire this can be achieved by adding another hierarchy level to the fleet system above the position of fleet commander a tentative name for that position is fleet admiral or fleet general this would ofc also require a new leadership skill which would have to be rank 16 wc is rank 8 fc is rank 12thus the new maximum fleet size would become 256x51  1281
hum 1200 pilotes fighting in a system already creating huge lag so 21281 possibly fighting
yes  we need bigger blobs current ones are to small
this edition is badly needed people seem to be acting like fools thinking that the 256 hierarchy is somehow limiting blobs 1 i dont want to limit blobs i like big fight and i cannot lie 2 people are simply flying 3 different fleets in tandem so you might as well for convenience sake expand the brackets256 as the maximum hierarchy was invented with the introduction of revelations 1 in winter 2006 and is therefore outdated
neither lag nor the fleet size limitation is keeping people from bringing 500 blobs we are quickly approaching battles with 2000 pilots my proposal just pays respect to the evolution of fleet sizes and removes a moderate annoyanceif you want to stop blob warfare youd have to change game mechanics which is a completely different matter
yeah this has been needed for a while
only if you include some cool heavy duty battleship size ship that gives out new bonuses the entire leadership aspect of the game needs a revampanyone care to propose something that vastly includes all of this or group of people for that matter
yes
you mean like a titan 375 hp is nothing to sneeze at i hear im all for new leadership stuff if its reasonable and welldesigned but what we have now isnt bad
would it help if only certain fleet members could have more than 10 pilots on their watchlist
sokratesz for president
you comparison is flawed scramblers and webs are not inter replacable modules they have completely different purposes its like comparing apples and oranges
a module which reduces that stat of an enemy ship with 60 seems pretty good to meand your comparison with scram is flawed what is your scram going to do against ship with ab yes they exist in pvp what are you going to do when a scram isnt enough to slow down your opponent use a second scram
1090 agreedthe speed nerf was utterly rendered moot when they also castrated webs the end result no change whatsoever and an entire class of ships was rendered little better than dust collectorsa max skilled huginnrapier needs 2 or 3 webs to slow down an interceptor and even then they can easily get beyond web range before theyre slowed down enough to catchthe old web strengths need to be returned
the old webs were insta death for small shipsatm you got some chance to speed tank under web unlike in the pastnot supported
thisif you want 90 webs then fly serp shigs or marauders
to be honest your comparison of webs and scrams are just insane scrams are used for pointing a target so heshe cant warp off try just webbing a target and heshe just warps of faster i thing webs are balanced as they are as just stated actually have a chance of speed tanking with webs as they are nowi you have problems catching them even when you web them you either need more webs or a faster ship i can strongly recommend going minmatar for speed

why
the idea is to find some way to bring combat escorts into the gamei dont care to help the solo miner and really is 30 seconds going to prevent gankings no of course not nor should it gankings are part of the riskthe issue is that the game mechanics at this point are so out of whack that there is near zero counter to a ganking in high sec and the loss ration is drastically out of whack when most times the gankers make moneyi am simply trying to find a way to balance the mechanics while also diluting the profit of the industrial ships
this idea is bad and you should feel bad
there is a counter to suicide ganking all you need to do to prevent it in most cases is engage that module that you always have present but few people activateyour brain
would be cool for freighters a builtin modefor regular haulerstransports definitely not you can already tank them pretty nicely or use a blockade runner
agreed mining missions are worse than courier missions and thats saying something i highly support changes to make them better
teadaze  come on you grouse about someone putting words in your mouth and then you go and put words in mineno proposal ive suggested which have had several possible options would ever provide 100 security for the ship thats simply untrue making it difficult to steal as opposed to ridiculously easy as it is now is not 100 secure at all thats the garage alt routeeven if a supercarrier could be anchored in such a way that it was entirely unstealable it would still not be anything like 100 secure because its floating there in space how long do you think it would be before an enemy scout found it reported it and then an enemy fleet showed up to take down the pos and kill itits a couple dozen billion isk target 100 secure i dont know of any system in 00 that is secure enough to prevent a determined strike like that from eventually succeeding i have had to run large gate camps in the middle of nc space in heartland systems just because there was no one around to chase off the gangthere would always be risk in leaving them unattended and truth to be told few would use the system after the first few got popped theyd go right back to garage alts i expectme  id move mine around to keep that from happening at least easily but thats also a fair bit of work if every or even a lot of cap pilots got them there would be a lot of lost supercarriers until people learned how best to hide them and even that would be tough100 security is not and has not ever been the goal just something that isnt ridiculous
this is a pointless threadop should bother to sum up his points this has been a waste of my time
tea should be the last one to talk about 100 security you support use of garage alt and have your super capital magically vanish into nothingness thats somehow more risky then leaving it at a pos that can be taken down right
i do not like this proposal if you need to park it buy supercapital alt put it on same account as your main and if you need to fly it just log to that character if you are opposed of alts then tough luck nothing can be done for you you can always use capital ship maintenace bay btw if you are willing to park it without pilot somewhere it is as good as anchoring its just those with proper acsess in your corporation can take it
fair enough here you gosupercapital ownership thats supercarriers and titans is borked because these ships are extremely valuable and cannot be docked anyplace the current standard for players who own them is to have an alt who logs out in them making a ship which is supposed to never be able to leave space or dock anywhere magically disappear it is then 100 secure immune to scouting or attack except when actually in usethe only other realistic option is to have a character sit in it 100 of the time because of the ease of theft that leaving such ships at a pos entails because of bumping and pos lack of security such ships are ludicrously easy to steal if left unattended being restricted to sitting forever in a ship which cannot dock that also cost you a zillion isk doesnt allow for very enjoyable play and is a ludicrous limitation as it almost entirely keeps the character from being able to play the gamesecurity for such ships needs to be improved so that there are other options available one might be to allow a character to anchor a supercapital when not in use another might be to improve pos security which needs to happen for lots of other reasons as well and other might be to fix bumping because right now its ludicrous yet another might be to simply not allow logging out in such ships but that has other issues that need attending to like what does a player do if theyre on holiday or some suchto sum upgarage alts are bad because they are too goodowning a supercap without one isnt practical at all the risk is far too high if unattended and gameplay suffers unreasonably if you elect to just never leave itthese things mean that some other option should be available to players who wish to fly one of these ships
no
this is prolly almost as ed as trying to use insider information and then wondering why your not on the committee anymore almostbut hey how about a compromise give lark his medal back then permaban him id support that petition
this is a blight on the game currently
not supportedbe a man and declare war on the cans owners if you really want the stuff they leave in it if it is a npc corp go declare war on a real corp problem solvedthe problem with hacking secure cans really isnt that stuff is left in them people with a brain wont leave anything valuable in them for more than a few minutes hours at most it is the now added ability to can flip from a secure can which defeats the purpose of a secure canthere are plenty of noobs jetcanning and even not so noobs doing it you can go pick on them to pad your killmails
supported because i can read and respond meaningfully to more than one topic in less than 5 minutes no need for me to wait that long in order to contributei also dont chicken peck type which may be where some of the confusion comes from those not supporting this
i raised this issue it passed the csm and it will be discussed in iceland youre welcome p
the thing is that now when the 5 mins timer can hold most of the spams and other stupid replies away like the keylogger topics and that then i want to have a timer herebut if the timer gets changed to 2 mins instead that i mean is not to long and if it still can keep most of the spams away then im actually in for lowering the timer to 2 minsim not very active on the forum now but still when im on the forum im still getting hit by the timer alot because when im browsing the forum i usually have multiple topics open that im gonna reply to so when i have replied to one topic i then want to reply to the 2nd one and so onand then i have to wait 5 mins before i can reply to the next topic as long im not doing the log off  log on thing on the forum here no i havent done that my self at all thoughso yes im gonna cross out the support button here because i rather see the timer down to 2 mins
now i think it is mostly universally recognized that the procurer is one of the most useless ships in the game since as a mining ship it really fails to mine a large quantity of minerals in a given time and at the same time it takes only 15ish hours to train up to mbarge iii in which you could buy a retriever which has double the mining capacityright now i am looking at the training prerequisites to fly a procurer and a retriever they are identical except that a retriever needs mb iiicurrently the time it would take to train for a procurer would be 11 days this would vary depending on learning skills that means there is a major gap between training for a procurer and then training for a retrievermy thought is that mining barges prerequisites could be changed to require industry lvl iii instead of industry lvl v which would basically cut 7 days out of that training time while at the same time the retriever and covetor can have a prerequisite of industry lvl v added to them since the only prerequisite to fly either ship is mining barge iii and v respectivelythe only thing that would change is that a procurer would not take so long to train for obviously anyone dedicated to becoming a miner will go to a retrievercovetorhulk this proposal is simple to let nondedicated miners get to the procurerthoughtssupport
that seems fairly sensible its not like making a procurer easier to fly breaks anything after all
currently ive only ever seen one procurer in game and i was baffled wondering why the person had even purchased one as i sat in my shiny brand new retrieveri think doing this would allow people who dont want to train so long access to strip miners and would make the procurer worth getting even if the one reason is just that it is quicker to train to
instead it should have boni to gas harvesting to make it moe viable than a cruiser
why doesnt ccp open the eve gate and let us go back to earth just expand eve and let us go back through the gate i mean just add the milky way and itl spread the player base out more maybe even cut lag a bit too
well from the rp standpoint thats not possible it blew up from the technical standpoint i dont think it will cut the lag
from an rp standpoint you can make literally anything possible with creative storytelling you have to figure the old earthbased civilizations are quite a few thousand years of exponential technology development ahead and can probably do whatever they feel like as far as spacebut yeah new servers will cut the lag spreading the current servers over more systems likely will not
supported but only on the condition goons are invited first to go through enmasse then quickly shut it again
dont big wormholes also screw up the time differences between point a and b of a wormholemaybe its thousands and thousands of years for us but just mere seconds for the sol system people earth
id love having more space that doesnt have 00 alliances in it that shoot anything that isnt one of them as for lag reduction players tend to group together even if they dont have to youd need aditional game mechanics that steer people towards spreading out in whatever new space you open rather than converging to create jita all over again i would however love to find out whatever happened to the people on the other side of the eve wormhole even if it was just that they figured out how to send communication signals from one end to the other to create an ingredient for the writers to use in their chronicles so perhaps not for the reasons you mentioned i would still love for the eve gate to be reopened
1 rpwise earthlings were constantly at war over resources and such thats why they started colonizing on this side of the eve gate so either they have killed each other off in the thousands of years since it closed or they are so advanced that itd put the jove to shame in which case they could easily have technology you cant even dream of like 1 mil km doomsday rockets on their frigates or a smartie that deals a bazillion damage to anything within 5 jumps or a carrier that deploys fighters piloted by chuck norris and vin diesel2 if they were still there wouldnt it be likely they would have been trying to get back here ever since especially if all the resources were used up you think salvage ninjas are bad now just imagine all the earth refugees pouring through cannibal npcs who scoop your podsicles3 all id like to see is the description to hold to its word but even then the turbulence is enough to rip to pieces any vessel foolish enough to wander close to it and yet its just a background image honestly the first time i made the trek i was expecting to wake up in a med clone
perceived problemas i am sure others will too i tend to cruise onto this forum once in a while when i have some extra time on my hands to check out proposals and voice my support or disdain after just getting the hang of it and showing some thumbs i quickly encounter a messageyou are going too fast wait five minutes and try againno wonder proposals dont get more supportproposed solution modify the post limit on this board so that you can post as many replies as you want but only one per thread every five minutes keep the time limit on posting new threads of course
if someone logs offdisconot logged in  they should not be allowed to receive remote repairsim sure this idea wont receive any flames
how would privateers save their ships without it
please explain why this is a problem
i agree even though this topic is old and undersupported and the proposal not entirely clear disliking the orsuggest you repropose a bit more clear sometime soon
id change the proposal to be a time period determined by ccp to best balance server load and usefulness but otherwise i support anything is better than nothing
the guys a douche needs to be permabanned for the joke he has turned the csm intoand while were on the subject of banning douches may i put shigs up for consideration
csm was a joke well before lark
sounds reasonable
not supported the stunt from mazzilliu was worse for the csm representation imho
u mad
im seeing mad
i was unaware of the fact that we could simply elect to ban players ill get my listsarcasmdo i think what lark did was wrong obviouslydo i think he got off too lightly yes i really dodo i want the player base to have the power to initiate the banning of other players are you completely insanealsohe definitely mad
nah hes just jealousfuture mutant great spamtroll epic fail on delivery
that may be so but your falling for a weak troll 
much needed
yes
absolutely signedon my last killmail i did take a little over 11k damage in total in my loki but on the killmail it shows 0 damage just look hereyeah nice fix there ccp does your qa guys even use 1 min to even test out stuffs before you guys release a fix  patch
putting my autograph on this i still believe that the best solution is official killboards this would do so much to remove the usual cooking of mails and hidding of losses
just look at dg report half the kms are wrong
supportedelse i would want a forum setting for not displaying animated signature images
more damage than their guided counterparts i didnt bring turrets into this at all the high damage turrets all have their price to pay for their larger dps compared to their long ranged turret counterparts unguided missiles happen to be range  explosion radius
they usually pay with range for the higher dmg making close range missiles more dependant on target sign than the long range missiles makes no senseor they should get more dmg to start withyou can argue that unguided missiles are designed to be used against bigger targets but then they should do much more dmg agains those than same sized turrets to be balanced if unguided m only do as much dmg agains bigger ships as the close range turrets and do much less against same or small size there is a clear unbalancedoes motion prediction applies for close range turrets too yes it does thats why guided missile prediction should be applied to unguided missilesbtw missiles explosion velocities are way too small
im gonna have to say no to this one one of the major logistical hurdles of the new sovereignty system is the fact that youve got to take a npcmanufactured item which only fits in a freighter to your sovereign systemim all for more items made by players but the assembly hall already had this thread and there wasnt much support under 50 if there was a compensatory change to the game to match it which didnt cause a large number of players grief id support it as it stands right now i cannot support the notion
