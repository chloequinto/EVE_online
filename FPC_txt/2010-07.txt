nice one
any improvement would be an improvement
black ops skill bonus 5 jump range per levelalso make jump portal generation affect isotope fuel usage instead of just strontium usage for titan jpgs
this
increase jump rage by at least 50 but keep portal range same as it is now if you want to gank at greater distance then put the bo on the front lineincrease gank but keep resistances as they are now bos would fit well in the assasins role with more gank than tank strike covertly deep within enemy lines

so many features need finishing treaties pos management faction warfare
as a new player all i hear is how ccp never fixes things just adds new unfinished features if i am to continue my subscription i want to know that the game improves over time that things are fixed a year from now i do not want to have to struggle with the same annoying things in the interface or other unfinished featureswhy should i waste my time and money in a game that does not improve
yep

developers like bioware blizzard and numerous others succeed and are widely loved by gamers because of their highquality standards i dont think anymore here means to imply that eve a lowquality game but there is always room for improvement and in some cases complete overhauls of pastfeatureswith a game as large and complex as eve i think people dont necessarily need new things to do in comparison to being able to do a lot of old things in a more streamlined fun and efficient mannerand judging from the past 69 pages of comments id say im not alone in that thoughtprocess

the original post is from almost exactly a year agoit received pretty major support is well thought out and reasonable however if im not wrong theres no ccp contribution to it how much approvals does one good idea need to achieve before it attracts attentionwere mainly talking about balance here takes no genius to see that catalyst and cormorant are sub par

i do not support thisi dont necessarily disagree with removing them i disagree with automatically giving everyone a free 10 attributes if you think the skills were a mistake to add from the start thats fine but i dont see anyone who dislikes the faster training i posted this in another thread on the matter but it seems like people just want to have their cake and eat it toothis proposal would actually be a buff for me also since i have only trained 54 on both of my accounts
signgreat idea totally support thisremove the learning skills
the first step in the wrong directionagainst it
i support removal of learning skills they are not fun plus i can imagine the shiny new skill id buy as a reward for training them
thisalso the proposal is a massive buff to alts which i wouldnt support eitherfinally the annoyance with the learning skill helps keeping the impatient and instant gratification crowd away from eveid find it much more interesting to remove attribute implants and boost all attributes by 5 to compensate but that wasnt the proposal so
theres just so much wrong with that statement i dont even know where to start
first off apparantly alot of people have very poor hearing comprehension sicne when does we think introducing them was a mistake but we dont want to simply remove them because thatll make alot of people angry translate to this ridiculous claim of ccp has already said tehy are definitely removing them  seriously those two statements are nothing alikesecondly since the learning skills supposedly add nothing to the game than if ccp does remove them it should simply be removal no sp reallocation for those of us that have them no 10 and 10 just a flat out removedthirdly the proposed plan isnt a cover all for everyones pain from this only the vets with 3 or more years of having the learnign skills have gotten the payout from learnign them those who havent been playing that time with them will get royally screwed by everyone startign with them now afterall they had to spend the unaccelerated time to train them up to that levelpersonally i dont care if they stay or not but if they go it shouldnt be a free for all attributes because people are lazy it should be simply you dont like them fine theyre goen along with the do nothing for the game trainign bonus they providedcash
what does laziness have to do with training skills in eve you think youre making a big effort by clicking and dragging those boxes into the training queue theres no work theres no effort in the case of learning skills there isnt even any interesting decisions apart from when would be the least annoying time to train them there is only time you are not a special snowflake because you paused your characters ability progression at one point in time to gradually increase it later everyone has to do this the only variant is how far they go between 43 and 55
whatever removes those stupids skills is fine with me
you wouldnt know sarcasm when you saw it rightanyway i profit from the impatient crowd so fine by me still not supported tho previous arguments still stand
the only people who would cry are the ones who will cry no matter what ccp does or does not do if you only make decisions based on what everyone will like you would never make decisions
to start with youre considering that laziness can only take a form of physical action which is incorrect the fact that you want a bonus because thats what you have defined in your head as the standard for absolutely nothing is sheer laziness the fact is the standard is the baseline stats you start with hence why learning skills provide a bonus do i need to link the definition of bonus to help you understand that pointsecondly i have a mining alt that only has 2 learning skills at 43 and the rest at like basic 2 or 3 and hes in a hulk so im sorry but your point is defeated right there so guess what they are optional as proven by such case any more attempts at such a paultry arguement to getting a bonus because these skills are supposedly mandatoryedit correcting abyssmal spelling and incorrect sue of youre
this is my main issue with people wanting the training skills removeditsi want the training skills removed and everyone given 10 to each attributewhich to me readsi cba to train the skills so gimme free stuffif you cba to learn them then dont if you think theyre worth the time then learn themif ccp do remove them i think the best way would be to remove them drop everyone back to basic attributes and release a load more implants with the best being a 15that way were back on track with the i think its worth my time to spend xbillion on implants so i have 25 in what ever attraibute
yes because alts are oh so relevant to this discussion here getting a new char in a hulk is 50 days training of course youre not going to put more learning skills into it if thats as far as you plan to go guess what most new players a dont know exactly what theyre going to do b dont plan to stop training skills after 50 days incidentally youd have been better off going 43 in everything except charisma even if you wanted hulk i and nothing elseagain training of skills requires minimal physical or mental effort they just require time
thats funny because the next thign on his list of things to get is to pilot a jump freighter yet im not wasting time with the learnign skills i should have to be effecient and considering tiem is the most precious commodity of all id say thats quiet a valuable thing to spend
but you do realize that the whole skillsystem is about time right it takes time to get skills in eve how the skill system were implemented wasnt given by some divine intervention i could have been set up in many different ways for example you could buy the skill and plug it in and immediately have the skill matrix style no training time or you could have the double training rate compared to now or just half of itas a new player what i did and many with me was that we acknowledged the system for what it was and accepted it as a fundamental premise for the game not necessarily because we thought it was the best conceivable system one could come up with but it was the same for everyone and that means parity which imo is important in any competitive gameit takes time to get skills in eve and learning skills are an integral part of this system asking for them to be removed is to be asking for a shortcut it is to say that you should not have to play the game at the same premise as players who came before you it should not take you three years to get to the point skill wise as those before you had to wait three years to achieveccp could take away learning skills and then add the time they take to train to the the rest of the skills by adjusting individual training rate then people could train fun skills all the time and did not have to deal with the boring learning skills wouldnt that be the most fair system why are you guys not suggesting that
but thats just it learning skills arent an integral part of the game you could strip them out and the rest of the game would chug along merrily without even noticing though of course everyone would be training more slowly if you didnt increase the base attributes to balance it out its an unnecessary addon to a very intricate well designed skill systemwould new players have it easier then veterans with learning skills gone not really since the vets are already ahead in every measurable way more knowledge more connections more skillpoints more isk so theres no reason they should feel threatened or aggrieved by a chance there new players just get to feel more useful a bit earlier no big deal the rest of the skill system still provides a good pacing mechanism to stop them hopping into battleships in week 2as to your final paragraph and suggestion for increasing skills to balance the time saved by getting instant 10s sure id go along with that i dont especially need or want faster training times im over the hump so to speak already and whenever i do hit a rut and need to wait for a skill to finish training i just go play another game in the meantimeedit  or i spam the eve forums as the case may be
it is annoying to train up learnings so please remove them waht comes as nextit is annoying to train bs from iv to v make it go much quickernewbies want to fly capitals a week after they have started make the training go quicker and give them 10 bil isk introduce joystickcontrol to evemake eve xbox compatibleno no no it is just the wrong way to go much better would it be to give the newbies 15m sp for their disposal so the still would need to decide whether they invest them in learnings or in spaceship command to fly big shiny ships right now
i could agree to that idea youd have to give out the skillbooks for free too though i guesspeople will still cry as its still not fair thoughtruth be told all the training skills do is divide the want nows and the want long terms squarely down the middlei can see it being a thin end of a wedge if learning skills are removedgive people 10stoo many support skills so everyone starts with lvl 3 in them etc etc etc
not supporting this ideathis proposal is a whole lot of something for nothing if you want the learning skills removed then remove them no free bonuses for anyone if this proposal passes whats next then i think the same people who support this proposal will be begin screaming that cyber implants are not fair either i meana new player cant use 5s right he or she would have to train a skill that skill would take a while the implants are expensive new players cant have that right away and thats not fair to them right lets do away with implants too or give all new players cybernetics 5 and full sets of 5 implants its fair because older players are already ahead of them and so they shouldnt have to work through the rules of the game to achieve any of that it should all just be given free right up front rightediti thought i was being cute about that buti just read in another thread a player proposing to remove the attribute implants and just give 5 to everyone there is no end to this giving in to this proposal is a slippery slope and the whiners will only ever want more and more and more for less and less and less
there is no time to waste remove the learning skills d
ccp have constructed their game so that new players are at a disadvantage compared to veterans it is a gamedesign the whole skillsystem puts new players at a disadvantage not just learning skills as i said it did not have to be this way you could get the skills by plugging them in and they could be cheap as dirt or you could have all skills to begin with those that now are veterans have also been new players that is important to remember
so you agree that removing learning skills would not remove the advantage veterans have rightfully earned for having subscribed and played for longer
i cant be sure but i dont think thats the point they were making having read a variety of your posts now though i can say you are quite adept at putting words in peoples mouths ill wager that you are a salesperson in rl i can see the assumptive sales technique in a great many of your posts once i look past your nearly religious hatred of learning skills your obvious bias and your nauseating sense of entitlement your salesmanship skills can be seento further address your last statement of course removing the learning skills removes  as you yourself called it  an advantage veterans have rightfully earned for having subscribed and played for longer you want to give that rightfully earned ability for training speed to the newest of the new and the most worthless of the unwilling you are contradicting yourself
i think you are trying to deflect the point im trying to make here or you just dont grasp it to me this is not a matter of safeguarding advantages for veterans as you are insinuating with your question the skillsystem is designed in a way that puts new players at a disadvantage compared to veterans therefore saying that learning skills should be removed because they put new players at a disadvantage is not really a valid argument obviously if the goal was to design a skillsystem that did not put new players at a disadvantage then training time should be removed completelyremoving learning skills would of course remove one of the disadvantages that new players have to face so yes new players today would have a faster and easier rout to skills compared to those that had very little starting sp no accelerated training time and had to train learning skills to get up to speed the question will then be why stop there why not keep spoonfeeding new players all kinds of stuff to make it easier on them because if learning skills are such a turn off for new players most likely they will find another obstacle they will not like that will put them off
i in no way mean to show a lack of respect for opposing opinions howeverin debate or rhetoric a slippery slope is a classical informal fallacy a slippery slope argument states that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact much like an object given a small push over the edge of a slope sliding all the way to the bottomwhile i can understand your concern you should consider the fact that just this one debate is a very heated and passionate one both sides bring valid points to the argument if learning skills were removed should any new arguments calling for similar changes appear id be confident that such passions would prevent the slippery slope collaspe of evethat said in my opinion the cons of learning skills outweigh the pros whether that holds true to the majority of the playerbase remains to be seen however and i fully understand the oppositions concerns i simply mean to show that such an argument isnt really valid
im not making that argument though i dont give a toss if veterans have 50 or 500 million more skill points than me since im not in direct competition with them its those who dont want learning skills removed that say its unfair to vets and will close the gap i dont care i just want the extremely strong incentive for new players to not train useful skills for their first daysweeksmonths to be removed if they rolled that time into slightly longer training time needed for other skills itd be a decent compromiseedit  and yeah the slippery slope argument is weakedit2  and i think learning skills are sufficiently different to other skills that to justify removing them note the absence of any other complaints about other skill training times
yes but trying to misconstrue someones argument is also common in rhetoric the point im trying to make here is that the same logic that is being used to argue that training skills should be removed can be used to argue that training time for skills should be shortened or even removed learning skills are not fundamentally different from the skill system as a whole acquiring skill takes time that is the fundamental trait of the systemthis is not a slippery slope argument for example saying that you should not yield to terrorist demands because that will lead to more terrorism is not a slippery slope argument even if it could be construed to be such an argumenta slippery slope argument is more like if you try weed you are bound to end up as heavy drug addict
its definitely a slippery slope the fallacy is avoided because the middle ground is acknowledged you guys do know that there are other possible compromises on the learning skill situation besides the way this is currently drafted right this current proposal is simply a welfare bill free stuff for the needy
ok well then i think we agree i was mostly arguing against the essence in many of the arguments and requests raised in these learning skill threads you mentioned the time aspect though
what i have to train advanced spaceship command to level 5 just so i can get into a carrier so i train a full month just so that my carrier will align to warp 04 seconds faster ccp are you kidding me gee that is a really fun game you have here  not if advanced spaceship command lvl 5 is a prerequisite it does not add anything to the game everyone who want to fly a carrier must train it remove that skill and just bump up the agility stat for capital ships this is a major turn off for new players who want to get into capital ships this need to change ccpand learning skills also of course learning skills should also be removedparodyedit ok this was semitrolling but i think the point being made is valid anyway this will be my last input on this matter
everyones thinking ityou build a colony position who knows how many extractors link them all here and there and then whatevery day you log in and aggravate your carpel tunnel by having to resurvey and reset every single oneso hows about we get a quick option through the command center which is otherwise a completely useless objectreset extractors 5 minute cycle  30 minutes to depletion 15 minute cycle  5 hours to depletion 30 minute cycle  23 hours to depletion 1 hour cycle  96 hours to depletionsubmit
ill go one better it should allow you to set up batch jobs so that you only ever need to set up the chain of production oncealthough this would require ccp to have competent ui design
agree
if they didnt want to stop playing they should have bought more game time trying to compensate people for past screwups on their part is a slippery slope with no bottom it seems i have to spell out everythingin rl sometimes you move to an area wo internet connection you loose your job and need to cut back on spendings your video card explode and you dont have the money to buy a new one right away ectdont render judgement on things before you think about the reasons behind them
no
the idea has been discussed over and over again live with the consequences of your actions or lack thereof
we do not need large amount of noobs whos hardly played the game and dont know how everything works playing characters with godly sp just because they happen to have made a trail char in 2003 itll ruin the game
you seem to think that we are simply disagreeing with you because we dont understand what you are proposing its not as if we havent thought about itwere not going to have a sudden epiphany and realize that you were right all along were not morons
no terrible ideawhyi still have a character from 2004  the first character that ive made when i entered this game so what now i should be able to boost that character with millions of skillpoints
well it seems it has become a farming post now for those who follow the herdsimple fact  it doesnt have any impact on the game except for the character that need it no reason to object to iti think its a great idea and i wont stop pushing it
1 create new account2 create 3 characters3 unsub account4 return 6 months later buy sp for all 3 charactersyeah thats not dumbalso doesnt have an effect on game how about the sudden influx of characters and your juvenile persistence means nothing if you cant get even one voice to support you on here you think the csm or ccp is going to back youps please stop quoting people like that pottsey person use the quote button like everyone else you are not special
like every features in eve is supported by all players  loland btw if you pay 6 months later or you pay for 6 months back to back its the same thing thats the point what i propose is to buy back what you could have paid  didnt pay in the past so no exploit posible thereand dont even try to make this personal by baiting me with attacks you said what you thought about this now go away
features already in eve  selling characters for isk paying monthly fees with isk changing your characters face moredo you realy think what i propose isnt in the realm of what eve is already wake up guys lolits good for players and its good for ccpget rdy its coming
its instant sp buying and its not gonna come ever troll removed zymurgist
i cant sleep every night because ive lost so much sp
the way ccp could do it total of sps of the character  number of total months subscribed  average sps per monthafter you look at the number of month the character wasnt active and voila ex  a character has 30000000 sps and played a total of 25 months  an average of 1200000 per monththat character stoped on and off for a total of 5 months so 5 x 1200000  6000000 of sps he can buy5 x 1495  7475 for the totala character could never exeed the maximum possible of sp he could have related to the number of yearsmonths heshe existand even with a new influx of sp the character will need isk to buy skills and stuff so that will still be advantagous to players who are active
op continues to post under the delusion people have the slightest interest in this ideaop is confused indeed
he is french
good idea
i do not fear anybody who uses this facility nor anybody who fears this facility
if poeple stopped playing then no this idea is not supported they quit the game they know whats happening to their skill pointsi will only support this option if one person payed for an account and in that time if he lost sp because of x reason like a patch bad schedule or so then yesfor the new guys we didnt have any skill queue so we had to fix our work or school schedule for eves skill system
absolutely notif you quit playing that is your perogative but dont expect to jump back in and buy your way back to an even footing with those who stay if you plan on playing again in the future keep your skills training  that doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out i took a break for about three months but i set up my queue to train as long as possible mostly learning skills and loggedin periodically to keep it full when i came back i lost nothing except the isk earnings which you can buy back by selling gtcs in the forum which i did  and i actually got a jump on the game by having my learning skills all but maxxedoutan unequivical not supported
i totaly agree with you this is the way to go about it normaly you just train your skills and dont realy playbut sometimes players simply dont have the choice of continuing to pay per month and need to stop for whatever reasonsthats why my proposition is a good idea to help those who didnt have a choice in quitting and now can reactify that situation
and how are ccp supposed to decide who is deserving and who is not
my mate dave is extremely pleased that youre all terrified of the account he abandoned three years ago because if i wanted to play a game with that many bugs in it id play one i wrote he says that if ccp woke up in the morning suddenly deserving of over 500 dollars and he had 500 dollars he didnt even need anymore he would love to insta spawn a titan pilot that has no titan or prospect of getting one just to scare you all with because it would be oh so very very scarey oooooo like a big scarey ghost with a white sheet over its head going wooooooooopersonally i dont think my mate dave is very funnyalso this proposal would be awesome because the bitter vets could all sell their old spying trial accounts on ebay for like 20 each instead of having to actually build characters and sell them on ebay not that i know anybody who does that or anything like that
they could put a cap of 1 year worth of sps you can buy backthat way very old accounts wouldnt have that exploitable aspect
please fix this

missions after you clear a room of all enemies you become able to bookmark that space to come back later without passing all gates again scanning and gating mechanics remain otherwise unchangedmission bookmarks pros require you to actively bookmark spaceUFFFD great increase in mission space gameplay value thanks to the reduction of travel times you can only bookmark and warp back to a gate thats clear of enemiesUFFFD eliminates the unnecessary grief and annoyment of returning to a mission after a few hours for whatever reasonparticularly important for casual players or for long missionsUFFFD allows pve configured ships to quickly warpout refit warpinwhen pvp threatened in pve space opening a pvp scenario currently unavailable and very interesting at the moment a carebear can be tracked and jumped to into pve space but he cant do the same with his mission ridiculousUFFFD streamlines salvaging looting in active missions makes it actually less boring consUFFFD none you have to bookmark to benefit from anything
uhm  if someone probes you out in a mission they have to jump through all the gates aswell they cant warp directly into your current pocket
none of those pros are really good in my opinionpve players should be penalised from fitting their ship badly for a mission or if they need to constantly warp out to repair personally i think theyre far too generous in letting you warp out at all in most mmos if you get in over your head in a dungeon you die with little or no possibility of fleeingand it would make plexingmissioning in lowsec less safe since you can often spot an incoming gankfleet on your d scanner as they go through the gates with your suggestion they could scan and warp to you directly with much less warning time
in most mmos you do not loose all your gear instantly upon death which may be months of work regardles i dont care what most csms have thats why i play eve and not soemthing else most mmos dont have csm should we go down to their level
so dont fly what you cant afford to lose shouldnt apply to pve in eve
sorry but i dont think you get itgating scanning everything is unchangedthe only variation is that you can bookmark gates you cleared from enemiesim sure you understand that this does not affect your actual ability to warp from an enemy populated gate which you cant bookmark and warp in to exactly as of nowim sure you understand that this does not affect your ability to track gankfleets in d scannerif anything it lets you warp out fast refit warp in to a pocket where ai is not pounding you and be ready for some pvpoh and furthermoreit sure does apply but this is a case ofdont travel for 5 boring minutes from pockets you cleared hours ago to reach an enemy populated pocketrather

this please
its the sheer number of clicks that i cant hack
yes  reduction in clicks once set up would make a big difference to my rsi
i concur please seed the bpo
i fully support this since eve is a sandbox game attempting to mimic real life principals it seems to me that someone should be able to reverseengineer this ship to create more and even to improve on its design creating t2 and even t3 versionsthe unique nature of the free ship can still remain intact as the bpo wont be of the free ship but rather an alternate iteration either with a different paintjob or different or expanded cargo specs etc
there should be a production bpcbpo version of this hull it does not need to be the same ship stat wise with the primea but this ship mesh should not be wasted on a oneoff ship that will never see space
i love this idea eve gate really needs more features such as this too being able to communicate in alliance chat while on the web page would be even better but something similar to google chat and how it seamlessly integrates with checking your email would be great

hello csmmy thoughts on domination and the general moves to make lowsec  00 more accessible and attractive to highsec dwellers id like to know if ccp has considered reshaping the security status of some of the quieter parts of eve a quick check of dotlan maps shows dozens and dozens of systems which are off the main traffic routes and are away from mission hubs which receive little or no traffic this is most evident in highsec where there is little incentive for pilots to inhabit those areas of spacemy proposal would be to identify a number of quiet and empty systems and lower their security status to lowsec these small pockets or islands of lowsec in would give focus to those areas and will encourage pilots to dip their toes into the more dangerous parts of eve in search of better roids rats and exploration isk id go further also dominion brought about a shift from large alliances holding vast areas of space to one where large alliances dominate but dont hold vast areas of space if we want to see more smaller alliances holding space we need to free up some space i would not touch the politics of the larger alliances so my proposal is simple npcs should vacate some of their nullsec systems why should they get to hang onto vast areas of space when domination was intended to counter that very problem lets free up some npc space so that there are more systems which we can fight over again i would focus these efforts on some of the quieter systems in summaryconvert dead highsec systems to lowsecconvert some 00 npc space to sovereign 00 spacekeep up the good work
1 by converting npc 00 to sov 00 the smaller entities living there will just be pushed out by the larger alliances not sure if you considered that however i agree that with the changes brought with dominion npc 00 could use some looking at2 empire is small enough as it isso i cant support the proposal in this form
1 npc 00 is way more fun to roam through than sov spaceand it gives everyone the options to dock up when something comes up irl or you run into a blob and need a break so no to that part2 what is really wrong with quiet highsec i mean lots of lowsec around those quiet highsec areas is just as dead i know lowsec areas where you can do 1015jumps and you might see 23 people in local over the whole tripso i highly doubt your proposal would bring more live to lowsec there is enough quiet lowsec out there for grabsthat said  not supported
quiet parts of highsec are nice for some semlucrative exploring in a safer environment then lowsec or if you dont yet have a combat ship to handle the higher level plexes fine as they are in my opinionalso how would converting a dead highsec area to lowsec make it any less dead
lowsec is useless npc 00 is awesome why would anyone want more of lowsec and less npc 00and making it into claimable 00 wont open any opportunities to claim them for new alliances there is plenty of unclaimed 00 space even now try claiming that and see what happensif its more fighting then this is the way  1 npc space should be connected to lowseclike cursesyndicate not surrounded by claimable space1a more npc territory in delve and fountain12 and 7 systems for major pirate factions really2 more stations  great wildlandsouter ring are pathetic venal is only slightly better3 add lvl 5 pirate agents and clusters of lvl 4 q20 agentswhere those arent present alreadythere now there is fighting all over npc space
not all npc 00 was created equally maybe my view of npc 00 life is too heavily influenced by great wildlands where there are just 3 stations serving 101 systems dont get me wrong i like npc space i just dont like to see it under used like in gw so i get back to the point that if those stupid thukkers wont do something with it they should give it up 
come down to curse 
how about leave losec alone add 23 more npc regions like curse and stain either of which are probably used by more people than the whole of losecnpc 00 is the natural spawning ground for small and new corps and alliances and we need more not less of itlosec does need a boost but simply making more of it wouldnt help anyone
well said malc low secs issues are not mentioned in this thread the size of lowsec has absolutely nothing to do with it so lets skip that npc 00 does need more stations but it also simply needs more space better and more numerous pipelines to sec space would be a plus nothing like going to roam in npc space and realizing every way in is blocked by a large alliance gate op
fountain core is the best place ever smug
i like complexity for the challenge and if theres a damn good reason for it
1 remove local  either make it more like wh space or get rid of it entirely if you get rid of the immediate faces then you wont know theres an unfriendly person in your system until they want you to know or leave the faces but use constellation instead so you arent sure if theyre right behind you or 3 jumps over2 implement afk timer  if a character goes inactive for 1hr theyre booted to the login screen theres nothing in eve that requires your presence but not your interaction and if you say youre a cloaked scout then you should be reporting back every once in a while not staring at the enemy for over an hour without a sitrep during that time
funny because as stated above ccp has said they want it implemented and there are already modules in the game but not seeded ofc that can probe cloaked ships
cloaks have a purpose to be 100 totally undetectable now if you could detect what is the purpose then even if you could probe them down it would put your self in danger probing requires a lot of attention and time just to find something that may or may not be worth something probe in low sec or null sec and your asking to be popped so no
100 agreed in fact i think i suggested that before
this is something i could go with too bad its not the op
every time you click scan the client sends a request to the server the server have to process the request by finding all objects that are in your scan range and send the list to your client your client then have to process the raw message it got from tq and apply a filter so that only the items that are in your overview if the apply overview settings box is checked would be shown in the scan results additionally objects must be filtered by angle of your directional scanneror even worse the server itself filters your scan results it would be an odd programing decision but who knowsso basically you are suggesting that there should be a built in option that sends dozens of mostly useless requests per minute just because you want to feel saferthere should be more options that are solving the lag problem not making it worse not supported
how about being able to add it as a shortcut where instead of clicking with the mouse we could click our keyboard like ctrl  something
strawman much
no just a programmer man i need a vacation
its not a strawman if hes actually explaining what it is youre asking for
what im asking for and what mr smartguy is trying to explain are two different things as can be gleaned from my posts in this thread hope this isnt too challenging
are you seriously that stupid the current form of the dscanner is not balanced in any way towards a predatory style of play your dscanner is probably one of the best tools to keep you from being royally screwed whenever youre in a hostile situation hint that means its defensive too omg
im beginning to think you areare you aware that a pilot in space can be combatprobed in six seconds or less and that unless you are spamming the scan button at least that much read every 6 seconds you wont see them coming please explain how a potential target having to smash a button every 6 seconds reasonable while a predator not only can use combat probes but can also use the dscanner to avoid having to keep combat probes out too long for detectionso then i ask you are you seriously that stupid
6 seconds or less as far as im aware the best time one can achieve on the scan time is 5 seconds except to get it to that point they have to do a couple of other scans first move the probes around etc it takes longer then 6 seconds to scan something down if you are that scared of probers just dock up when you see unfamiliar faces in local or make sure you pay attn to the dscanner ive never been jumped unawares when using it further supposing i have been jumped unaware it would be because i didnt notice something already available to me either a new guy in local or a ship on the scan list i dont see how this proposal would improve upon that in anyway
right hes explaining what would happen if ccp did it youre describing a fantasy world where computers dont need to do calculations in order to give you data directional scanner not scan probes
itll just create entrenched industrial class making it impossible for new characters to compete even if they max out skills not supportedt2 bpos need to go the 2 systems cannot coexist reimburse the market value and get it over with
yes the idea is tempting but as said previously it isnt eve eve is the only game where you dont get any skills by grinding until your eyes bleed and i like it that way i agree that t2 bpos are unfair at this moment and ill bet they will fix them the moment i get my hands on onenot supported in this formedit by the way excellent photoshop skills
while i would like to see t2 bpos go i suspect that will never happenthis is pretty close to a ideal solution
ok so after a couple of weeks i can invent a t2 bpo of module a from a t1 bposo i buy a t1 bpo and make a t2 bpo of it after adding all the costs i sell it at a reasonable 10000 mark up if i am the first to make itnext dayweekwhatever is the time to build it i sell the next at a 1000 markup as teens of people has done the sameafter another cycle i sell at a 1005 markup on my production costs in the meantime the profits of inventors of module a have gone from good returns to 0 as all the competitors now have bpo the production of the t2 bpo stay mostly in the hands of the few guys that have developed the skill first as inventing become an added cost to develop the skill and producing from invented bpc at least for ships will be done at a net large loss so unless you reset the counter every time a guy produce a t2 bpo you have just killed the invention market in a few weeksmonthseven if the counter is reset you dont cure the basic flaw depicted above you only make the death slower and more agonizing
no you did not seem to have read and understood what this is about before posting you should have an actual look at it you might like itafter several years of making the same t2 bpc day after day having your invention queue filled 237 your character understands what it takes and can build t2 products from t1 bpos some people seem to think that this is grinding there is a nomad jump freighter laughing at that idea right now if you really consider something that takes a month for the bpo to be copied for invention and if it took a decade for your character to obtain the ability to create nomads from a fenrir bpo you have an amazingly different view of what grinding is compared to methere is a comfortable balance here which seems very logical too me
the idea doesnt appear to have been inventing a t2 bpo  the idea is that your character can now build that t2 item from any t1 bpobpc the knowledge was stored in the character sheet and as such isnt transferrable any more than skillpoints areagain this seems like a totally reasonable way to conquer the gap between t2 bpos and invention without obsoleting t2 bpos  or even significantly hurting their utilityliang
heres the problemyour objective is higher profits on invention and higher profits from producingif there is no risk the risk of failure everyone and their dog can do it this drives the price down the more people with a 0 failure rate the more products on the market the more products on the market the lower your profit marginsinvention was wildly profitable when it was first implemented and then it was made 10 times easier when ccp discovered a huge t2 bpo cartel that had the main objective of rmt they wanted to ensure nobody could make a living off of t2 bpos in real life and they succeeded at thatinventors themselves drive the price down the only reason why there is any profit in some items is because of the failures if there was no failures it would be just as profitable as t1 productionif you want t2 invention to be just like t1 production then this is for youadd on top of that the fact that most inventors cant do math and dont use excel when producing and dont realise they are losing money and they keep having to buy gtcs to fund their production lines and you have a situation where you can never profitthere are plenty of items that have no t2 bpos and they dont produc a profit eithert2 bpos will phase themselves out slowly over time as the old timers quit a lot of my own t2 prints arent being used right now mostly because im lazy and i already have the most pimp ships in the game
yes because making t2 bpo production trivial for any halfway serious industrialist wont make real t2 bpos obsolete i dont think youve quite thought through the consequences of this proposal after the first few weeks of it being in game
short cut to launch which dronessome ships have more than one set of drones i even hear that carriers might have multiple sets those cheating bastards so which drone will get launched when you press your new key
supported
i use drone shortcuts a lot but i never missed a launch drones command tbh still useful and supported
well almoust everything can be built at pos except the new starbase structures a new factory would be wellcome or adding the ability to build the structures at an existing type of factory would be beneficial in both highsec where npc factories are overcrowded and deep 00 with purpose of colonizing the respective system  constelation  region even if pi is player orientated all the final products are intended for strict corporate use p4s
this was already proposed a couple weeks ago no need for a second thread
please add a new column to this view that lets you see at a glance what meta level a module isbeing able to order by multiple columns would be amazing too in certain ms products like the dynamics crm you can hold the shift key and click extra column headers to extend your ordering for example this would let you order by high slots that are meta 4thanksedit updated for clarity
good idea would make it much easier to sortfind stuff especially when it comes to things that are not named in a simple way amarr lasers for example
considering the incredibly painful painfulness of sorting through your loot after some missions i dare to say there are very few missionrunners who wouldnt support this
its amazing how hard it is to see meta level considering what a key stat it is definitely supported it should also be listed more clearly in the market overview would make shopping as a newbie considerably easier
im pretty sure that the csm has raised this at least twice already while i wholeheartedly support the idea it doesnt need to be raised again

personally i like the learning skills they ballence off that do i want more now or much more later that people should work out for themselveswhen i started i trained the first 3 levels of each skill rather quickly and got the basics to 4 while mixing in other skills as it should bethen the same with the advanced onesanywaywhen most people say remove the learning skills they always add in and give everyone 10 attributeswhyif its not worth your time to train the learning skills then why should you and everyone else get a free boosti propose that ccp remove the learning skills out right with no change to attributes so everyone gets set back to base learning skillsthen they introduce a number of new implants taking us from a max of 5 to a max of 15 points on the implant1 to 10 should be moderatly priced in a way that doesnt gimp pvp when you have a full set in your head or itll just cripple it more than lag doespossibly even some kind of life insurance policy could be setup the same as with ships11 to 15 should be chicken teeth in price with 15 being painfully expensiveall the extra gunnery bonuses etc should be either moved to the 11 to 15 range or boosted for that rangemaybe a 1 on 1s 2 on 2s etcid also like to see blueprints for implants and possibly even salvaging of biomass to spir on this new line of productionitd break cost down roughly and off the top of my head as1  10002  25003  62504  156255  390626  976567  2441408  6103519  152587810  381469711  953674312  2384185713  5960464414  14901161115  372529029thats just multiplying the previous value by 25at a minimum id like to see reprocessing of biomass for materias so i can build ships out of the dead but thats another thingso eveforumgoers tell me how much i suck 
i had to lol because that is exactly the opposite of what id propose remove attribute implants altogether your proposal exacerbates the following issues1 it is an additional disadvatage to newerpoorer players pay to advance is bad game design2 even more hassle to keep using jump clones and wait on timers for doing pvp to protect expensive implants and be able to benefit from them when not pewingso hell noedit when removing implants give players 5 to attributes across the board to compensate those who already have implants pluged in and not can reimburse them for the isk and lp they are worth in the lp store
its not a bad idea i dont particularly like the give everyone 10 attributes idea eitherprices are a little off though i think based on your pricing just about anyone would be able to afford a set of 10s which is comparable to 55 learning skills now and im fairly certain most people do not have 55 learning to have the equivalent of 54 and a set of 5s it would be about 60mil per implant not sure that is a steep enough price to pay considering 5 implants are what 100 mil per if not more currently in any regard balancing around price is never really a good idea
what about those that buy implants for  on various skills like gunnery etcid like to see the jc timers lowered or a skill introduced that lowers them tooin eve youre constantly paying to advanced what with it being a time based systemthe numbers i used are incredibly rough and would obviously need alot of balancing its more to give an idea of concept rather than final numbers
they remain untouched i only cited attribute implantsyes me too but thats another battleyou cant throw it all into the same basket there are fixed onetime isk sinks like skillbooks which everyone wanting to do certain things must pay i was referring to game mechanics that allow players to advance faster than others by paying currency like i said this would again benefit the rich while at the same time subverting the concept of eve being a time based game
i have my guys to the equivelent of the plus nine if you dont count the learning skill itself that means that instead of buying a plus 5 implant for 115 million i have to pay a 30 mil mark up per slot for that your pricing is good but when it gets to the high end is a tad out of sync my carrier clone would need the plus1 13s to be even with what he has now and instead of his head being worth 100 million when he gets podded in his fours its now 300 the one though 10 price is decent but when you get to implants that actually matter your being quite prohibitive with a 323 percent mark up for the best one compared to now per slot
eve is all about blobbing more then your enemy very small roams have a big disadvantage and almost everytime get outblobbedso i was thinking how do you prevent more people to get into the fight and thus preventing blobbing the enemy i came up with thisgive a pilot the option to put up a bubble like a pos shield but with the difference that people can shoot eachother inside the bubble pilots can leave the bubble but cant get in not even friendlies the idea is to keep people out of the fight the attacking force still needs to scamweb the ship or else it will escape how such a bubble is created is up to the devs i think a form of launcher like a probe launcher would be nice this way even 1 man gangs can fly the ship they want and use this option
no eve is all about player cooperation if i cant ask my corp for assistance then eve is no longer about tactics or cooperation
well it forces you to play more with others rather then ratplexmine alone
i cant see how this would not be abused not supported
please allow this in high sec so that i can put one ontop of every gate in jita preventing anybodys escape

once and for all how naive of you to think that something ccp makes will ever be finishedbugfreedefinitenevertheless the ui is by far the worst technical aspect of eve among the things that are not obviously broken at least so i can support this it looks and behaves dated like the window manager of an obscure nix operating system from the 90s just much buggier it is an example of practically almost all usability sins that can be committedlemme just list what i think are the most annoying things of the ui randomly repositioning windows  clicking buttons doesnt always yield a result at all there is a right and wrong moment which for a new players is not distinguishable  lists that dont sort as they should lists showing objects that should be filtered yep shoot friendlies resetting scrollbar positions the joy of trying to find a target beginning with m in a large fleet fight trying to explain to a newbie how to set up his overview the nightmare of corp member roles and rights management the nightmare of managing and configuring poss includes nondescript options and access configuration which has no effect because the feature never got finished  missing visual differentiation of items with values differing by a factor of one million certain server requests make the eve client hang until a response is given 5th level rightclicksubmenus overlapping notification messages no good solution for dealing with the proliferation of windows the general amount of clicks or ui steps to achieve a result when setting something up that takes 20 clicks only the last click will give an error message if something is missing no differentiation between alerts of varying importance this monument represents is displayed exactly the same way as one saying if you do this you will die the ugly font a large portion of the key shortcuts cannot be remappedthe list goes on and on
i have been pretty tolerant of the broken features after a new release but today i discover that the autopilot is borked essentially rendering my day for eve a day for something else instead while the post release bugs have often seemed random enough to remind me of what the ms operating system hairball must actually look like when something as fundamental as autopilot is broken in a release i think that ccp is relying on us end users just a little to much to do their work for themi propose that the next major upgrade have no new features and consist entirely of fixing everything that has been broken by the last 10 as well as maybe reworking the software architecture a bit to keep them from embarrassing themselves worse than they have by this latest random tragedy
um the patch you are looking for will be arriving tomorrow but yeah i agree with the general point one expansion of just fleshing out old features and fixing bugsrebalancing would be nice
time for ccp to dig up their no new features shirtsstarting to think that this might be symptom of the eves bastardisation of the subscription model breaking downis it the case that plex have caused ccp to chase new subscriptions to the point that their model no longer provides cashflow without feature creepcould this possibly be the reason why ccp is releasing expansion after expansion with no bug fixes or rebalancing etcare there simply not enough existing customers paying subscription fees forcing ccp must chase these new customers who buy plex at the expensive of all othershow long is that approach sustainable before eve suffers a mass exodus
what i really dont understand how your antecedent leads to your conclusion if there is a connection between the op and the bastard eve subscription model you have failed to make it clear in anyway what that actually might bealso you do realize that plexs ultimately derive from cash spent right
i remember the bootini bug that was fundamental who uses autopilot anyway especially without cheking the route lol the bug that sends all minnie mission runners to the same system combined with the ap bug has made low sec what it was always supposed to be full of targets
how does this have anything to do with the point in questionfirst they came for the autopilot then they came for somefeature that you use
further clarificationtry planning a route without itcareful reading does wonders for the mind
not supported we pay ccp to do their job  they should do it and youre forgetting about the amount of trolls on this forum believe me you dont even want to imagine what kind of artwork would flood the forum
ccp seems to hire from their player base quite frequently its not talent they are having trouble finding its the scope of their project i guarantee you they have a busy art dept they just have different priorities
sure but dont stop there when you can have like1 skills manager  he can only train the skills you already have and not inject new ones theres no harm in that2 rd agents manager  just because youre on some campaign it doesnt mean that you should not harvest your datacores3 lp store manager  just because youre on some campaign it doesnt mean that you shouldnt be able to cash in your loyalty pointsterrible idea not supported

so theres a cap of nine issues twice a month that seems remarkably low
yeah surely giving ccp 19 or 29 issues a month to look at would be more realistic
1 not everything that hits the csm meeting stage gets passed id say you probably lose a third or so to being voted down 2 its a maximum not an average the average has always been lower than 18 per month except at the very beginning of csm1 but there have been plenty of big meetings with a lot more than nine issues raised  either for reasons of deadlines or simply because it was a good week on the assembly hall id rather let big meetings happen because in practice the result of issues being pushed back is that 23 are forgotten entirely 3 theres a lot of really minor issues out there and i have no objection to throwing them at ccps feet en masse i wrote a blog post about this topic if you care about my thinking in detail but basically i think the csm needs to split issues into two piles big stuff needs a more comprehensive process than csm issues have at present small issues need a faster process than the csm uses right now if small issues are done in bulk theres no great reason to limit yourself
we have 10 meetings between now and the next summit and 9 issues per meeting means potentially 90 issues can be discussed on past performance it is likely the majority will be passed 9 issues will take between 152 hours to discuss the longer a single meeting runs the more likely people wont pay attentionfor comparison csm4 handled 76 issues in total during its term of which about 17 were rejected also note that only 2 meetings during csm4 handled more than 9 issuesit is also getting increasingly hard to find well supported issues in the assembly hall which havent already been raised by a previous csm most proposals only gain 2030 supports but to make up the quota get raised anywaycsm already have 180 issues in the eve backlog and i see little point in trying to double that in the next 6 months instead we need to focus on raising the most important issues and working with ccp on items already in development hopefully we can help them avoid making another pi introduction ballsup
a backlog of 180 issues and a 75 pass rate says to me that the csm needs to apply a much more rigorous standard to passing issues passing stuff on the basis of yeah i guess this would be cool to have and i cant see how it would hurt anything is simply not appropriate when ccp evidently dont have the resources available for looking at this is a gamebreakingly awful issue that was raised 18 months agoif you have 10 meetings a year then passing an average of one major issue and maybe 12 minor tweaks dont tell me that a lot of coding needs to be done to change the rocket stats per meeting is enough and more than enough imowe can ask you as our representatives to load ccp with a backlog sufficient to lst them until sol goes in to its red giant phase but if the truly important stuff is getting lost in the noise then its harming our game not helping it
is there any chance that maybe at some point you stop asking ccp for the moon on a stickyouve had your answer they dont have time to do pretty much anything so theres not even any point the csm talking about any issue that sounds like its more than a couple of days work for a single personi recognise that it would be way cool to have ccp do something that your name was once on the internet near but face reality its not going to happenplease champion some of these little things for a change i hear something about rockets a lot whichever csm5 delegate gets one tiny change out of ccp will gain more kudos than the delegate that has the grandest proposal rejected yet again by ccphow about it
firstly we raise player proposals most of the time at least i do and many of those are simple fixes i have no clue where you got the idea that we only champion whole expansion level featuressecondly ccp class many of the minor issues we bring up as bugfixes and indicated that our time would be better spent on bigger picture issues which is why the summit format changed
i would like to raise this issueeve nebulaevelopedia link
firstly from the last csm meeting minutessecondly ccp classing bugfixes as so irrelevant even the csm shouldnt speak of them is good enough reason to speak of themthirdly the holiday in iceland yielded precisely nothing according to all your wildly differing blogsrantsattack pieces the only thing that differs is the words used to describe the nothingness ranging from frustrating nothing to extremely positive nothing with ccps commitments to anything other than eve as the main reason nothing is getting donei dont remember the last csm or any csm asking for clickyfarmville on planets sure youll be able to find a couple of lines in some meeting where somebody said planets what are they for can we have those and not a lot else but the csm cant even get bugs fixed let alone expansions nailed outbut if you want to go right ahead pretending youre shaping eve ill be jiggered if im going to try and stop you well just keep on not getting listened to by the csm which doesnt get listened to by ccp
you know there was one csm member who expressed admiration of farmville in space
anyone willing to take this back againas shown through continued support this is still wantedthe resurrection the dead horse pos thread comes back to lifewikito date we have only ever seen references to what ccp has said about this topic and no real in depth discussion about it while we know ccp has talked to the csm about it can any more information on those discussions be disclosedon a slightly different issue the minutes on the last csm summit meeting to iceland were very vague and didnt go very deep into any details i at least and most likely quite a few others would like a copy of the raw notes from this meeting with just the information that would fall under the nda to be removed im not sure how ccp or the csm feel about it but i think the notes taken by the csm were better because they were more detailed
i get it that you dislike the csm but if you are going to troll at least check the facts before you make a bigger fool of yourselflets look at the moon on a stick expansion level features raised during the last meeting improve overload user interface dynamic missions targeting from broadcast history spreading out mission runners colour stars by systems i can jump to commit to fixing the uiyep some good moon on a stick things there glad to see we are ignoring all the little issues like you suggest we are in fact the only one that could be classed as an expansion level feature was fix factional warfare and that was voted down because it was already in the backlog and we had a whole session on it at the summitalso look at csm4 for another long list of smaller fixes suggested by playersyes and no there is no point spending a 50min session on an issue if it boils down tocsm x is broken it is doing y instead of zccp that is a bug well look into it45 mins of tumbleweedany player can and should bug report things so they get entered into the system ccp are moving towards using the csm to discuss stuff under nda which they cant discuss with the rest of the players yetyour points would carry more weight if you didnt bring out the old chestnut of holiday in iceland instead of 3 days of constant meetings for 810 hourswe cant release the full details of the meetings till ccp publish the minutes and then it will be at least 6 months till we see if anything has been taken on boardor did you expect lag to be fixed as soon as the csm discussed it with ccpif you can point to where the csm isnt listening to your fabulous proposals instead of whining about free holidays then perhaps we can help
nothing new to say about this other than csm keep pushing for it and ccp keep saying it is in the backlogcsm didnt get any raw logs from the csm4 summit so i think it unlikely but well bring it up and see what happens
if you think those things are easy its you that is making the bigger fool of yourself as if that were even possible after everything weve had to endure from csm5 so fardid you miss the bit where ccp told you that they had nothing for you no resources at all because i didnt miss it it was pretty damm stark they might have a person available to make the overload button into a rectangle thats ugly but functional but you think theyre going to make a bit of the ui functional especially if its uglyyou spend the 45 minutes discussing why these bugs arent getting addressed for years literally years not figuratively years not throwing spoons and blogging against each otherif the csm comprised a group of individuals with years of experience at designing things everybody can tolerate instead of a group of people who think they know what they want i can see a reason for ccp trusting them with heads up datayours would if something got done as it is 3 days in iceland throwing spoons drinking and blogging sounds a lot like a holiday to meand as its all on the hush hush ccp can claim anything they like about it in the marketing mediafor saying i was on about avoiding moons on sticks thats a pretty neat way to make a big fool of yourself i did not say csm was ignoring my proposals did i i dont think i did maybe you are answering somebody else without realising itand no you cant help ive seen that already it was for my own education i even looked at the csm since it wont just go away gracefully sadly its as relevant as i had always feared and its worthiness is reflected well by ccps commitment to it and the careful consideration given by a very small percentage of eligible voters it will never be relevant without massive reform
reading the raw meeting log ill be surprised if they can fit 9 issues in per meeting
were in iceland
i would like to express my gratitude towards all csm members who sacrifice quit some of their game and free time towards helping to better the gamehaving been in a sortlike position in another direction i can tell its a lot of work and a lot of times people dont realise that the return for those who do this work is negligeable or even none presenta lot of times they get people telling them how it would have been better but when looking at it those are always people who never step up to any responcebility when it comes to iti am going to say something blasphemous now but i see the csm contributing as much to eve as chribba each in its own unique way i am sure a lot of people wont agree with the previous statement but that is as i see itso yes its easy to say its all going too slow or certain issues dont get handled but when push comes to shove they are going for key issuesseeing the limitations which the csm has to get its workload done in i can only say i am pleasantly surprisedsome leeway towards these players should be givensincerekg
i was wondering if the csm could clarify a few questions i have regarding the processes necessary to raise an issue during a meeting1 how many support votes are necessary before an issue is popular enough to bring to the meeting2 are votes really needed at all3 once an issue is raised but is turned down by the council majority can that issue be reworked and be presented again is there a limit to how many times this can occurbout it really
1 thats up to the judgement of the individual csm member 2 not needed per se but they are a useful method of finding out what the community thinks on an issue 3 in theory yes but in practice no issue has ever been brought up more than twice
so what you are saying is when tq becomes sentient it will start fixing bugs
i like your usage of the word when
shes right sokratesz is a jerk 
ankh whatever your position on issues is you have produced a very nice summary thank you
supported setting up poses right now is superugly as is the result you get
please please please ccp im begging you  make some much needed changes to these shipsive been training for months to get into one so please fix this ship at least within 2010i dont want to wait years to play in a shiptype i actually likeat the very least increase the jumprange and make bridge activation cost not so hurtful for everything above frigateid say base jumprange 3ly to a maximum of 675ly as that is still not enough to traverse huge amount of spaceand less than titan jumprange which is pretty hillarious if you ask me  finally they need alot more hp than they have now at least 25 total hp buffalthough im not really asking for anything other than jumprange boost at the momentim having a hard time being useful and the plea is simple i want to be able to use the ship i like the most

supportednot because i see any indication that ccp will ever act upon it but the least the playerbase can do is to remind them of their shortcomings every single chance we get
omg yes
dierdra vaal i have to agree with you on this what good is adding content if you can not play it because the base it is add too is unstablemost game companies do not realize the impact that this has on them until it is too late
i completely agree the excellence slogan has become a cruel joke especially as ccp does the one thing many of us have defended them by claiming will never happen allowed incarna and dust to take massive developer priority over eves core experiencewe need you to live up to your motto ccp
completely agree
the push for more sisi lag testing is a good step but we need developer time assigned to fixing and iterating features finish what you start ccp

whilst i loathe the comparison to that awful piece of legislation i fully support this
what better way to spend a free activation than to support this proposal i dont think there is anything that shows more how great a game eve is then the community around it even after people have stopped playing because of the lack of development if ccp commits to dierdras proposal im certain eve will become the first real mmorpg ever made
supportedwhile i support it i didnt check the box because i think that by making it an aggressive act you impair mission runners since i dont think there will be a way ccp can recognize whether they are repping you while being attacked by an npc or a playercheers
i was thinking maybe i should petition every single blaster boat i lose because ccp are too lazy to fix this problem the only thing they might be able to understand is harrassmentgive blasters more range ffs
blasters range boost  pulsesdo not brake races tactics balanceblaster boats need damage boost to compensate all disadvantages range cap use fixed damage big fitting requirements
this makes sence i think this is a must carriers should have had this when the first one roled off the assembly line they are a logistics boat after all i think there should be several options to heal your drone without using your rr these two are off the top of my head1 slow passive regen once the repair order is issued doubled or tripled in traige2 a quick nanite repair paste fix near instantthe first should come nothing near that of capital rr the nanite quick fix should be really fast and those people complaining about how the carrier could just keep redocking and paste it whats the big deal it just like overheating your weapons turning them off naniting them then turning them back on carriers need this where are they supposed to repai drone hull damage in the middle of enemy territory or worse fighter hull damage lets face it remote hull repair is fail why would you waste a high slot on it when you could control 1 more drone or run another capital rr moduleedit spell fix
unsupportedyouve got this ability already either use your own fitting bay to put on some remote repairers which should be in your hangar somewhere or launch damaged drones  a couple of repair drones and fix them using your own dronescrazy though it sounds id support hull repair drones

actually what almost all of you asking for the learning skills to be removed have asked for is the 10 and 10 bonuses provided by those skills for free several of us for the skills staying have said that if you want to remove them than simply take them away and the bonus they provide there is a big difference between asking that the skills are removed and asking for the bonus they provide for free if all youre truly concerned about is new players being able to train fun skills without worry of learning skills then we dont need the bonuses ive made this point multiple times now and youve yet to address why it is you want the bonuses even though you want the skills removed once again its simple evidence that you simply want something for free instead of it truly being a matter of helping the new players enjoy the fun of the game without a stupid time sink with no benefits after all its a worthless time sink with no benefits so why should you get the bonuses they provide ill support the removal of the learning skills without even a redistribution of said points invested if it meant a true removal and none of this instant gratification nonsense you lot keep spouting
and most people think that doubling or even tripling training times would not be a good idea do you have any good reasons as to why we should want doubled or tripled training timesand while were at it we really should get rid of those free remaps and accelerated training bonus and newbie tutorials or at least start charging for them us old timers didnt have them in the beginningis this really about wanting something free or is this about getting a better value for our 1499montheh have you not been paying attention the whole problem is that its not a worthless time sink its such an incredibly useful time sink that if you plan on playing the for any length of time the most logical course of action is to spend the first month first remap and all of your accelerated training time to get the learning skills up to at least 54
you will not know how many more people hated and was driven away by the learning skill because you cannot post here without a active account i myself deleted my character with 5 implants and speak here at the last training that stuff simply makes me feel silly that i am paying months for nothing and i was just hijacked by the skills instead of playing because of feeling funi simply want to tell ccp that learning skills absulotely screws rookie experence up and whom skills hurting is not only rookies but also you 3 quarters of the rookies will be driven away by the freaking waiting for something does no help to gameplay and by those geek veterans who are more than happy to make the game geeker what ccp doing is just blocking money away just for no reason all my friends invited quited after a few weeksleaving a character remains capable for nothingso stop talking about patience they play for fun and they dont need a game to teach them how miserable and ridiculous life can be they just chose to not to feel sillyif 90 of rookies are driven awayit is not about patience it is about a geek system and a desigeners failureall innovations will annoy someoneso what should american keep slaveryalthough some veterans threaten with quit i am sure they will not abandon their 50m character just because they get 45m more for free all they really lose is just their superiority built up in a game and that is just because others in the game are crippled come on  you are not really that patheticare youa fun game is a good gamenot a geek one
so when exactly does the game get fun when you have 5m sp or is at 10m sp is there a magical number where the fun suddenly begins i thought the first month in the game was very fun i recently took an alt with 18 m sp and went through an epic arc in 00 flying a rifter for me it was challenging and funi dont really understand all this obsessing with learning skills you just need to see the bigger picture that training learning skills means a little progress in every useful skill you yet have to train they are not fundamentally different from the skillsystem as a whole i dont say this to gloat or to try to push you down as a veteran player i really dont have anything against you also having fun there are things in other games that puts me off too for example i just had to read a review of a certain blizzard game to know that i never would play that game of course i could have gone to their forums and complain about how much their game suck and how they should change it to suit me point being no game will suit everyone some will like it others will not eve is obviously not an exception here
not supported i say keep the learning skills i didnt kill all that time spent training them up just to have my attributes taken away i prefer being able to reduce my training times i intend to take all the learning skills to level 5 and thats that if you dont like training the learning skills then do them later once you have something interesting trained up so that you have something to do while you wait lazyness will get you nowhere in this game
1 read the op post2 if you still dont get it read again3 goto24 goto25 goto26 goto27 you shouldve now realized that none wants to take your invested skill points away8 if not goto2
learning skills are nothing but an unnecessary barrier to new players committing to the game they do not add to the game or improve anyones play experience
i was just fed up with those hardcore moan against rookie moanwe cannot get better ui because we are hardcorewe cannot get bigger texts because we are hardcorewe have to block rookies away and have fewer players because of that everyone brings up rifter when talking about sp problem rifter may be fun to an alt character who worriies about nothing and can be alted back any time you like but rifters are not that fun when all you have is rifter and cannot afford to lose iti had 15m characterbut i fully support of removing ls because it is a fundestoryer operating spaceships may be fun in this game training to make your character grow may be fun being told that you have to train months for nothing is notand that is exactly what ls tells rookiesits not about ruining veteran advantagesits about less unecessary geek hardcore and let more have funi hope that the game take some effort to satisfy more people rather than being a hardcore  full of pathetic geekit is ok if the game was intended to be hard to playbut now to the rookies it feels more like eve is forbidden to play
actually the easiest one to point out would be that youre against the very skills that have made you use to the current speed if the skills never existed you wouldnt know the difference so i stand by the complete removalactually i would personally be all for that since i personally enjoy games that take forever and encourage long bouts of frustration if the value isnt currently already worth it why are you paying it youre argument doesnt work in your favor since if the current state of the game isnt valuable enough to pay the 1499 than you wouldnt be paying iteh have you not been paying attention the whole problem is that its not a worthless time sink its such an incredibly useful time sink that if you plan on playing the for any length of time the most logical course of action is to spend the first month first remap and all of your accelerated training time to get the learning skills up to at least 54which once again be you asking for a skill based bonus for free if the skill that reduces the total amount of time it takes for every skill in the game is a problematic time sink than its total justification that every skill is a problematic time sink and should be removed because we dont want to spend the time to get the benefitsso reducign the tiem ti takes to learn everything else doesnt add to the game as for improving peoples experiences it makes things go faster please tell me how that isnt improving peoples experience since you dont think it is apparantly than you probably would agree on simply removign them completely without givign everyoen the attributes bonusdead wrong you train months so that you can shave time off of your total skill plan a good example is getting a new player into a harpy with t2 guns ab warp scrambler stasis field and rigging takes 70 days according to evemon withotu learning skills with learning skills it takes 54 days i would say that its a pretty big difference considerign that every other skill you train is likewise affected so its definitely not nothingyoure calling 2 months of trainign for an entire skill tree geek hardcore when there are individual skills that are as long if 2 months is hardcore than perhaps you shouldnt be playing since times only go up from teh startedit wrong word
and thats why the pro learning skills crowd will never quit as long as some people on one side think eve should be fun and the other side thinks like cash render here theres never going to be any agreement
you do realize that some people find being ocd about maxing thigns out to be fun right personally i just prefer a game that frustrates me because it means that its not a game ill be done with in a month or two mind you i think getting actual skills are fun but getting benefits for nothing is just plain pathetic and a disgrace its the first step toward wowdom
right which is why the whole debate is pointless since its down to personal preference as to what one enjoys in a game in any case ccp have already lowered the prerequisites on skills in the past probing thermodynamics cloaking etc so its not unlikely that theyd hand out other advantages to newer players in the future well have to wait and see what move the devs make
debates are never pointless as long as they dont turn into a bunch of insults slander and childishness a good debate is always a healthy thing and gives everyoen a chance to seehearread both sides of an argumentand waiting for the devs to decide is the only thing any of us can actually do abotu the subject but doesnt change that we can discuss what we think is best important thing is to keep it from becominc personal attacks
yeah the thing is were debating whether learning skills are a good thing for new players and since obviously those who were so put off by them that they stopped playing arent here to present their views only the dev team and their customer survey team knows how many of them there areplus even if they see that more players are put off by them they might decide they prefer it that way wouldnt be the first time theyve sidelined players opinions on things
are you ignoring the multiple new players who posted that they appreciated the learning skills as something to slow them down so they could get perspective on this huge new worldand as ive said many times anyone who sits in the station while training learning skills needs to find another game cause they wont survive well in eve while training those skills you can do some of the career missions you can learn how boring mining is or enjoyable if you like that sort of thing you can learn to steel cans from noob minors not condoning of course you can even venture into low sec in fact its best to go into low sec early so you dont risk implants and it will take a while to get the closetoriskfree jump clones

for a new player there are just too many skills need to be trained to get to the same level as some one starting out a few years ago since the game dynamics have changed so much over the yearsthe learning skills were a good timeisk sink back when there were not many skills in the game and players could make isk just in doing one or two things now we jump to forward and there are now over 350 skills in the game isk making has been nerfed to the point that you have to do 4 to 5 different things to make isk to support your selfpvping has also now changed to the point that t2 cruisersfitted battleships is a normal de facto if you want to have a fair chance at doing itthey need to go
use the current system they just implemented and give skillpoints back to those who invested in learningskills and yes i know most people benefitted from training learningskills but its still skillpoints removed and it should be reimbursedsupported
im not ignoring the prolearning skills newbies i recognised that its a personal preference thing a post or two ago my point was that the antilearning skills newbies who are really put off by them obviously arent here due to no longer playing eveand that only ccp have a full picture of which type are the majority from looking at those surveys people fill out when they unsuband yes you dont have to sit in a station while you train ls but that early exploration you suggested would only be more enjoyable if they could actually train skills relevant to each career path and if you can find one newbie poster who said that early skill progression would be too fast without learning skills to slow it down i will be very impressed and a little astounded
hey im all for being able to train faster  approvedi am rather curious though ccp just awarded every player a set of skill points to allocate wherever they choselikewise they could refund all players the sps they put into learning skills as for the money spent on the books ccp could also refund them the npc cost of the skill books required for said skillswhat did people not like about this solution
people who disapprove 70 trolls10 are people who couldnt read the suggestion20 are angry vets with no rl and dont want new players to join the game
i have a similarly clever listpeople who approve of this50 selfrighteous whiners with a runaway sense of entitlement50 drooling diaperting booger eatersyou what my list adds to this discussion that yours doesnt nothing they are both equally asinine
sorry but this type of arguments is very juvenileif you dont agree with me you must either be stupid or a troll or you live in momas basement lololololdont bring this down to this level pleaselets try to keep this as a somewhat civil debate although this subject obviously induce a lot of emotions i think it has been interesting to read both sides of the argument and the video link shows that ccp is aware of that this is a hot potato will be interesting to see how this will be resolved the drama
i am a noob started just a couple of weeks agoim not in any particular hurry so as i went through the tutorials and read the wiki it seemed to me to be the best strategy to train up to learning 5 and the other learning skills to 4 i did and i enjoyed it ill still have a few hundred k points of my 16 million bonus after analytical mind 5 completes tomorrow  83 skills total about 680k in learningi only hope the ccp solution is fair for those of us who spent some of their 100 bonus on learning and who have not played the game long enough to fully reap the longterm benefits thereof  ie the opportunity cost the proposal doesnt seem to consider this i admit i have not read the bulk of the other messages so i do not know if someone else has pointed this out 2x for learning points spent during the bonus might be fairi do not understand why 1 is fair to those who spent points on learning because those who did not would receive the same benefit
i do not support any modification of the learning skillsi have invested time by my own choosing train them if you want or dont
there are really only two opportunity costs for investing in learning1 potential time wasted doing activities you are bored because you dont have access to the skills to do activities you really want to do2 skill points invested in a meta skill instead of one that would actually get you somethingthe devs have no control over time and cant give you that back but they can reimburse your skill points the proposal does take this into consideration by giving you a temporary boost in training time equivalent to how many sps youve put into learningits fair because without learning skills all players would be operating at the same training times not considering implants personally i would prefer that we all train faster rather than sloweri forgot about the initial bonus period this sounds like a good idea  bigger increase in temporary training time boost for sps allocated during bonus period
id support this change learning skills need to be removedone change id make is to not give everyone 10 to each attribute immediately instead id phase it in gradually as players gain sp every 500k sp gives someone 1 to an attribute until they reach 10 this means that new specialty alts wont be able to train incredibly quickly towards specific builds while new players who play for a few months will still gradually get the 10 bonus
i like this idea its similar to one the devs suggested in the fanfest video of having a dual progression of learning and regular skills
now this i would support it would make sense instead of learning from a book you learn by doingi understand now thank you for clarifying
ccp set it up without batch jobs for a good reason they dont want people to have to spend 247 doing planetary interaction but they also dont want people to be able to go for more than a couple days without checking their pi thats what a minigame design is supposed to be about and i applaud ccp for this one although the 1click extractors would be nice
supported while its a good thing that you have to check in more often for more efficiency it doesnt have to be a drag when you do
i really like pi and i think that overall they did a really good job with its uias a former game development student i can appreciate how difficult it is to come up with simple details that convey a lot of information like the rings on the pinsthis is a great idea that would make the ui even betterapproved
supportedthey did a great job with pi this is my only gripe to datecheersdardol
omg my hand hurtz
it could even be bought with isk toofor those who like to do it like that
no play  gain sp  dont play  dont gain sp
lol are you playing eve or wow in eve u can have sp and dont play at all its called training an alt to sell it
supported
while i support a way that enables new players to somehow compete with old ones microtransactions and total reimbursement for time you havent actually played eve are not the way to go imo
if you mean by play log in to train your skills and log off that would be exactly the same thing that hes proposing if you log in only for sp who cares if you can buy back game time you didnt use 
exactly
i think it is a great ideai dont really see how there is room for exploit  you arent buying extra sp just bringing your character back up to speedas others have already pointed out you dont get sps in return for playing the game rather you receive sps for the amount of licensed ie paid for time has passed since your characters creationand as others have also pointed out you already have the option of buying a preskilled character from someone else the only difference is that youd be paying for the character that you put time intoon a respect for diversity note it allows anyone whos run into financial hardship for a couple months to jump back into the game without being penalizedi cant think of any downsides to this so id be interested to see if anybody can think of any legitimate ones
thumbs downcharacter logs in skills up to whatever he feels at a whim cancels subscription comes back 6 months later repeat process so basically all youve proposed is incredibly convenient character farming absolutely nolosing training cause you couldnt pay for a period of time is also not sufficient enough a reason you werent out flying and you werent hold up in some station in short you were not involved with the eve universe and deserve no skillpoints infact the only reasons i can think of besides downtimes that would be acceptable for sp allowances would be if you verifiably got hacked or banned from the game later to be found innocent those are the only two reasons if you want easy leveling go play something else
what is the difference between paying per month for an account train alts and sell them or paying the equivalent number of months after and have the same amount of sp if you properly read all that has been said youll see that no valuable reasons have come up to counter my ideaand btw eve is unique in that way the only game you can evolve and be offline thats why this is possible
this would be most useful especially when the inevitable change in pc comes about
supportedjust make it so we can rollback settings changes or rather backuprestore as required that way if we bust something we can just roll back

this was one of the things i campaigned on so 1
we can already see bookmarks in space if we open the map however we cannot see the location of bookmarks that are on the same grid adding this would be a useful feature for scouts  locals  warpins  rotating fleets etc sokwiki
i say yes
good ideaand being able to align to bookmarks wouldnt be a bad idea either
and also this threadassembly hall  proposal make ongrid bookmarks visible in space
bah i even checked for it on evelopedia nvm then 
yes yes yes not just on grid though make them visible on the overview like celestials and include mission bookmarks  youll be able to use bookmarks on a battlefield to let you warp around grid strategicly youll be able to select a bm and spam the warp to button as your ships structure drops towards 0 my 5 year old daughter wont spend 5 minutes of frustrating right clicking and attempting to select an option hidden multiple levels inside a cascading context menusee it benefits everyone
perhaps i typed the suggestion improperly for you to read between the lines something that isnt thereas of now ninja salvagers need to scan warp gate rightif the mission runner bookmarks gates warps out refits prepares popcorn takes a leak attends an astrophysics meeting  warps back to bookmark hours laterthat doesnt obvious buff ninja salvager stealth obvious proposal fail

with up to 5 jumpclones managing them can become tricky its easy to see what kind of learning implants a specific one has but looking up all the other implants by stats can be time consuming it would be dandy if we could rename jumpclones to remind ourselves what is inside them and for what ship or purpose they were setup sokwiki
supported this ship could be quite usefull if used properly and i hate to see it go to waste just sitting in hangars never to see the light of day
signedthe ship is agile and good looking although it could use a larger pi commodities cargo hold
if you want an official release then give us numbers how to make a good ore pi ship thats accesible for newer pilots and does the job well i absolutely love the concept of a primae but right now the ships stats are too bad to seed a bpo for it also the texture on the ship was made in about an hour in ms paint and needs finishing it would be super sexy if it could cloak and be a bit smallermore agile the bay sizes are fine perhaps a t1 t2 version with cloaknocloak or something 1 high 1 med slotsright now its an easy accessible for new players ship that is fast and agile enough to get my pi comodities and a cc through low security space im using it for that and id love if there was a ship like this in the future with exactly these atributes atleast just make a better texture for it
this would create an incentive for people to go into lowsec since ninjas would vulture mission bounties in highsec it would also remove the spawn me a haven with lp and concord protection problem that highsec missions have become
right first of all as much as i think level 4 pirate missions in highsec are silly from a story point of view this wouldnt fix themsecondly id still choose the odd guy sniping my bounties in highsec over the odd guy asploding my ship in lowsec lowsec missions would need to pay out 45 times as much minimum for me to be willing to risk a rigged domi or to fly a cheaper fit and thus complete missions more slowlyedit not to mention the logistical hassles of buying equipment and selling loot in lowsec highsec l4s need a big nerf or lowsec l4s a big buff only way to get more people missioning in lowsec

something tells me theres some reason ccp hasnt done it something technical or whatnot given how simple a mechanic it seems to be one thing i can think of is when you have a ton of drones swarming a target and all of their notifications stack on top of each other so that you cant see how much damage each one is doing on an individual basis
bringing the skill differences into the argument is just wrong someone with tech 2 has actively put that long training time into the weapons skills and there should be a significant difference to justify it cut the gap and you end up with a scenario where you could spend that time training defensive skills to a higher level than the guy who specialised in gnus yet still end up doing little less damage people have the choice of training it or not and if they dont shouldnt  about the consequencest2 ammo costs a mint it should be goodsupported
with very few exceptions all t2 ammo needs to be looked at there are only a few worth using at all i havent spent the time analyzing the situation as thoroughly as others have theres plenty of good information in the thread already so ill leave it at thati would like to add that faction ammo seems fine as is its t1 ammo that does more damage thats great t2 ammo should provide something unique and helpful that faction ammo does not i would also like to see some balance based on the size of the charge itself what about a close range ac ammo that does excellent damage but you can only fit half as many rounds in the gun this would go along with the minmatar philosophy of guerrilla warfare  get in quick hit something hard and get out before the duct tape falls off
supported fully ive done this many times early on and it was a bit frustratingalso i find the forum post delay timer frustrating
not supportedyou already said it yourself you see the warning window you see the warning window you dont read it and you click ok you blame that on ccps button placement  wow sorry but thats being lazy in my opinionfor the destination idea just use your people and place right click to set destination to another one and click on the same to remove it simple isnt it  now stop being lazy and stop blaming ccps for your lazyness
just because the ui isnt broken bad with things like the trash it option dosnt mean it couldnt be better and more finessedi also note that leave fleet and quit corporation tend to be on the same menu and nearnext to each other really quit corp shouldnt be on the same menu as leave fleet let alone near it

npc 00 connected directly to hisec works for me
npc 00 gives corpsalliances a nice base to attack the sov holding alliance in the region you can dock fit repair in those systemsthey should remain where they are they are a valuable base of operations if you ask me add npc 00 to every 00 region so there is a few places ppl can fight from
they should move npc 00 so that its acsessible from highlowsec where is the logic in having to move through hardcamped 00 sov systems to get to npc sov 00
massively boost lp for mission offered in lowsec no scramming frigates in lowsec misisons ever pirates are enough of a riskno webbing frigates should we remove them so we get people into lowsec and pewpewing at eachother thats good we might want to boost only lp also decrease cooldown on mission decline for lowsec agents to 12 hours i think we could make people go lowsec if we try hard enough for missionsmake lowsec npcs drop faction stuff with a low chanse why not
the lp reward is already high enough 15x more over l4sfaction ships in l5s might be nicescramweb frigs aint really a problem if you arent lazy enough to kill them firstthe biggest issue for me is the insane amount of faction missions you get from l5 agents
i am not talking about lvl 5s
annother i want ezpz pinatas in losec 0 thread please fk off already and stop whining theres plenty people and targets in lowsec where are these stupid ideas coming from constantly
this is so horribly wrong no there arent how is being a target for pirates and risking 100200 million isk in ship and equipment easy money please inform me or am i getting something wrong and you are completely invulnerable when missioning in lowsec
a this wont get carebears in lowsec they need the feeling of safety that highsec provides more than they need extra profitb make missions in low sec too rewarding and not only do you attract no carebears you get 00 sized alliances that just suppress all piracy in their zones of controlnot supported
dumb idea i wouldnt mind a small boost to lprewardsbounties but this is just silly in any case nothing you can do will attract carebears except for making low sec high sec i want low sec rewards boosted not to attract carebears but to reward the fortitude of those who setup shop there and make a system theirs
meaning no matter what id o nothing will help is that how i should understand it because the people holding the system will not benefit from this in any way right where does it state how big of a boost this is i havent given any numbersthere are other people except for carebares in eve you know guys
a better solution
dynamic agent quality would not in fact help  and the time that you spend ing about finding your next agent will guarantee that nobody at all will mission in low sec fscking stupid idea now to address the op i dont think i agree the real problem is with 03 and 04 space  since 02 space is passable and 01 space is nice the risk differential between 01 and 04 space is exactly nil so i think we can safely argue that there should be no reward difference either thus i propose that sec status becomes somewhat meaningless in lowsec  with rewards and game mechanics being the same across all of itliang
the time spent would be 30 seconds looking through the agent list im not seeing the issue
while i agree that that is a much solution that requres alot of effort to implement and is much more complex i would definately prefer that but this imao is better then nothing at all stupid idea to try populate lowsec what exactly is stupid please propose a better solution otherwise your ocmment is not very usefull
border lowsecs are more likely to be gatecamped instead of deep low 01 is usually safer than 04carebears stay in highsec or sovnull because its safe the only way to populate low is making it safer before mission scanning mission runners were in lowsec then it got implemented and they all left rewards were never the determining factor to begin with its safety
the stupid idea is ing about with finding new agents and moving my  like some kind of ing gypsy setting up a mission hub is a  ton of work and redoing it every couple of days is totally unacceptable yeah i could do it because i have a couple of carriers but no it isnt going to be fun no it isnt going to be easy and yes itll be a massive nerf when compared to todays mission running i did or did you stop reading when i told him that his idea was ed liang
gb2wowkthxbaisupporting the op but no faction loot
im confused though you say that you would have to move your mission running operation frequently but you also say that you guarantee that nobody would use the lowsec agents but the only way the quality would drop is if a lot of people used the agent frequently for a long period of time so why would you have to move if you guarantee nobody would be running missions

so since it is common knowledge that big alliances rely heavily on naps and blobbing only to achieve anything i think 00 should have a battle scenario that involves equal numbersi understand most alliances will be raging over the curse word known as equal right about now but i am more interested in smaller alliances having a chance where skill  numbersanyway this is how it will be done current sov mechanics will allow you to capture still however there will be a new method included which applies when engaging smaller coalition or being attacked by themyour powerblock will now actually by default be in a coalition similar to corps being in an alliance this is the only way blues reds and neuts can be made and strictly for 00 only as it requires you to get sov in other words without being in a powerblock you cant get sov the reason for this is because huge 45k naps is strategy therefore having powerblocks makes sensesay an enemy wishes to capture your system if your enemy is part of a coalition 50 or more smaller than yours he can op to attack you in a duel like scenario with 50 ships on each side max a battle will occur in the system that is contestedthis battle will happen within 48hrs and the system will have 2 accel gates 1 accessible to the attacker and 1 to the defender once ships are at their point and the countdown is over players will see a beacon appear visible to people who accessed the gate only from there they will attackthe scenario will include 3 structures which deal damage 50km apart from the beacon which must be destroyed the hp of these structures will be determined on the opposite sides fire power so more fire power brought in  stronger structures in both fire power and health this is to prevent nc laming with 50 titans these structures can also be repairedthe objective is to kill all structures and players anyone warping wont be able to warp back either and the accel will be locked to everyone once the fight starts whoever wins this will keep the systemduring the 48hr timer players in the coalition will have to assign 50 people they wish to defend them these people will only be allowed to access the accel gates this also will be the only way big powerblocks will be able to take sov from smaller onessince 00 naps cry at the littlest things i wouldnt mind seeing something doesnt have to be this in 00 where skill determines sov or at least have something like this in lowsec for the sake of population increase
seems like this will add some strategy and fun to sovbattles supported

congratulations on actually having an idea this time instead of just saying you dont like something in say lowsec for factional warfare this sounds like a good idea and i would support it as a possible faction warfare boostadditionbut for 001 on a technical side the ammount of processing and admin needed to judge and control such duels would be prohibitive 00 only gets major server power for reinforcing for big fights this would take so much more effort2 if a powerblock can set reds blues etc then three small powerblocks who total more than one large powerblock could take them down by individually attacking the large powerblock setting it to red and each other neutblue then the system would give advantages to the three smaller blocks that are working together even though in total they had more players that would make it unfair and would result in rules exploits using the letter to break the spiritbut3 at its heart your still saying you want to tell all 00 alliances how they play the game because you dont like it why do you feel you have the right to dictate to themyour last attempt at a post saying the big naps need to end dissapeared into obscurity with little support do you really feel it will work any better

there is no way to see howmuch m3 you have put into a contract until you click next after the item selection  which can be very annoying if you have to set up multiples and need to go back every time because you went over the limit this is also very annoying if you are trying to tailer a contract to a specific hauler a very easy fix would be to add a counter that keeps howmuch m3 you have until then selected sokwiki
the ability to unlearn a skill say industry 5 completely or to level 4 then having the ability to get a bonus to skill training time to put into another skill in effect giving people who tire of carebear ways a leg up geting into pvp quicker or even just someone who doesnt want what theyve trained for any longer
we dont need instant fotm training really
i didnt say instant i said bonus to training time im not saying instant amarr cruiser v to caldari cruiser v just quicker
faster fotm training is a stupid idea live with the consequences of your actions
every mmo i played had some kind of respeceve has already the neural remapthey could do a different version of the neural remap clear all skills and u could do it only once a year
most other mmo had a limit of skills you could train so you had to remap luckily eve doesnt have that kind of limits
something similar came up on scrapheap around the same time this thread was made  here was my responsethe original thread can be found here
cloaks save my shipfrom who pirates sov holders roaming gangs none of thosethey save my ship from the people who run bots all over npc 00 space you see the first thing they do when they discover their moneymakers have automatically docked up from my presence they start trying to hunt me down last time i checked i am the one trying to actually play the gameright now a cloak is the only thing stopping a bot to stop what the bot runners have because they have plenty of isk see takes a small gang  and thats before the rest of the npc 00 hogging alliance shows up
at the moment cloaks combine with the local channel to tell everyone insystem that there is also a cloaker there if we got rid of local wed also get rid of the perceived threat that afk cloakers present to people insystem i think that would be enough myself but here are a couple of other thoughts anyway1 probing cloaked ships might be ok if it cannot generate a warpable hit2 probing cloaked ships may not a problem as long as things still work ongrid the way they do now even if you obtain a warpable hit on a cloaked ship and warp so that they are ongrid the probe system should still not allow a lock onto the cloaked ship and if we cant lock then we need to look at the astrometrics deviation numbers to ensure that there is very little chance of coming out of warp within decloaking range or even smartbomb range of a cloaked ship which is not sat still really this needs testing on sisi first though  if warpable hits all end up in smartbomb range then wed need to rethink3 we could try something like an alternate ammo for an interdiction sphere launcher which would make cloaked ships within its area of effect become visible and visible on the overlay but not lockable makes interdictors a bit more useful still requires either smarties or a fast ships to bump the cloaker back to visibility even once they are revealed i am not entirely comfortable with this idea  i suspect it may be a bad thing when combined with gatecamps but it might be worth a discussion to see there are further tweaks to work around that issue

stripping objectthrowers of their csm chairs is not enough they need to be removed from the community entirely since they are a complete utter embarrassment to the community
ban player who want to ban csm members for throwing objects at other csm members
totally ban them from real life
how about reading what the thrownat csm said about why the spoon was thrown and seemingly didnt even take any serious offense by it spoonthrowing isnt exactly correct behaviour ill give you that but you also should take into consideration why it was done and the whole context which pretty much didnt get a highlight in the report
ban players who want to ban player who want to ban csm members for throwing objects at other csm membersif this is what passes for scandal on csm 5 i am disappoint
never thought i would say this but larkonisgate was definately better than spoongate serious at least he did something now we just got people going emo about a freaking spoon

i was replying to exlegion
whoops
last time i checked 5 seconds is less than 6 hence my statement 6 seconds or lessno you dont you could just use your directional scanner to probe down your target pinpointing it down exclusively with the dscanner and with as good an accuracy as 1 au all you really need the probes is for your warpable thats it bring your probes out get a hit 6 seconds thats itit takes longer to scan someone down im not arguing this as you are correct what i am arguing is that it only takes 6 seconds or less for actual probes to be out and about that isnt enough time for someone spending 30 minutes to an hour in a mission to notice them or even realize theyre being probed downi dont think you understand when i say the dscanner is more likely not to pick up probes so how exactly does the dscanner save you when there is only a window of about 6 seconds to see the probes for as long as someone is out doing their mission spamming the button every 6 seconds is not an acceptable counterdocking your mission ship every time a neutral or red appears in local is not a reasonable request and i think you know this especially in systems with good agents if i had to stop missioning every time this happened id make more mining in high sec than missioning in low sec space
i guess it was a bit too challengingi aint feeding this troll no more
make my game easier hell no
1 add combat probes to overview2 hit dscan watch for probes3 if youre not a complete moron youll already be aligned outif not youre an  and deserve to get scanned down you sir recieve todays imanat00living award i hope you feel like youve achieved somethingps youve confirmed that yes you are that stupid
you really have no idea what the difference between probing and scanning is this is a waste of time
even assuming your 6 sec window how would the op help you at all youd still have to be looking at the scan list every 6 seconds you just wouldnt have to push a button in other words pressing the button when you want to see or looking at the window makes no difference either way you get the same result it just so happens that scanning manually saves a hell of a lot of serverclient load
jin nibyoure right this change wouldnt exactly help that much other than shaving off a fraction of a second every process but thats why i saidhere
nobody said anything about making it trivial i have thought it through did you what i would anticipate happening is datacore prices go through the roof on the initial hype because everyone would buy them up t2 products will sink in price a bit because people would need to get their money back out of the hype pi will be very profitable and it would cost a lot to run a pos however as soon as people start to realize it may take years and tens of billions of isk worth of datacores to get where they want they will more than likely relax their grind position at that point i dont think you would see many people putting their datacores on the market would only keep them for themselves and depending on the luck of the inventor would start to have their first t2 ability in 6 months  2 years how does that sit with you
unsupportedwith your proposal what would basically happen is once you got the ability to use a t1 bpo as a t2 bpo youd run out buy ten of them and then start producing stuff like a madman leading to uber profits that would make the original t2 bpo owners weep tears of envythis suggestion would then move along and destroy any profits available in invention since every inventor would have the sole objective of getting to the point of being able to run ten factories off their fancy t1t2 skill prices would plummet and invention would become nonprofitable for allthats bad
agreed it would strangle the t2 market not supported
at first it seems cool people go invent stuff grind towards perfection and it all seems cool the first few people flip over make a killing a few people  but it still looks good and then the nonobsessives start to tick over in bulkand the t2 market goes to pot everything crashes the profits are at low levels for the people who do have bpo rights and everyone who doesnt faces the prospect of choosing between losing billions on the nowlaughable invention mechanics or never ever having the ability to produce t2 ever anyone who joins the game even a month after the mechanic goes live is forever locked out of t2 production unless they buy a character who has bpo rights  they might not be gamerules locked out but youd have to be insane to try because the initial cost is huge and the margins are low the datacore market dies a whimpering death as they start being given away six to a can of quafe because demand is zero t2 bpos are curiousities with no actual industrial need for them  id be amazed if they dont lose 90 of their value most t2 items of any quality lose a third to a half of their value as the costs stop being set by invention and start being set by bpo prices  and worse yet bpo prices for people who are locked into producing them and dont even have the option to exit a stale market at this point the bad t2 ships get even less often flown  why fly a huginn when the rapier is the same price you will destroy multiple careers multiple ships and implement a t2 lockout that is far and away worse than eve the one that was in place before invention existed in short this would be the single biggest screwjob of industry mechanics in eve history how exactly does it taking six months for that to happen make a difference
slightly better but it will still kill invention1 you are doing a typical error thinking your solution around t2 ships so the several years part but while getting to 100 in ships would require several years doing the same with modules if the percentage increase is the same will allow you to get your t2 building capacity in some week at mostyour example show very well this 2 if you get to use t1 bpo to build t2 items it man you can use 11 slots to build that item you only need enough t1 bposo every time someone develop this ability he get the equivalent of 11 bpo usable only by him practically as soon as very few players develp it they will corner the production of 1 model of the marauders or of the black ops bs and every other ship with low production3 bpo research the player will get the benefit of the research on the t1 bpo practically getting high level of research at very low cost in time and isk while t2 npo research is costly especially in time4 instead of selling bpo people will be selling t2 bp trained characters same net result
if you make a lot of assumptions and have a preconceived opinion on the topic and come here without shedding your previous arguments towards a t2 bpo balance we will not get anywherethe ultimate deciding factor of ships on the market comes down to the price of the manufacturing materials if someone could make 11 t1 bpos crank out an item at rates beyond what should be available  make a suggestion to tweak it so it is balanced instead of just saying no progress doesnt come from stubborn attitudesi made no assumptions on ships you made an assumption that i made the assumption and used that for an argument modules being grinded out in 2 weeks no same rule applies 6 months  2 yearsas for it killing invention  that comes off to me a lot as a chicken little post invention would be impacted yes but dont fear change simply because it is change things do counterbalance which you failed to acknowledge  if invention starts to die off then datacores become super cheap and it picks right back uphonestly at this point i think the worst part about any t2 bpo solution is that everyone already has their minds made up to the point where they argue ideas that were never even presented which sadly leaves the community out of having any sort of impact on the resolution
ok so my thought is this an npc operated bus service basically it would be a method of hauling pods around you could queue up in hek and hop on let the bus take you around on its merry meandering journey and then you can disembark in amarr it would be ungodly slow 05au slower than a freighter and you can only take your pod read zero cargo space it would make a giant loop around the core of new eden you could program alerts to wake you up when the bus shows up at the stop and to wake you up when you get to your stop akin to the rl bus if you fall asleep and miss your stop you are sol so you have to chose to get off the busi know i know youll say use autopilot but i say bus
i was thinking of somthing similar myself a taxi service or bus service from one station to another but i honestly dont see the point reallyalso in before eve is already too damn small mofos
although the idea has merit i dont really see the point of something which is already fulfilled by shuttles therefore i am asking what would be the advantage of this versus the use of shuttles
as long as i can suicide gank the bus
i kinda like the idea  very creative i know i hate having to travel long distancethat being said i agree with verys  it doesnt really add anything to the gameplay you can already ditch cargo space with a shuttle to lower your attractiveness as a gank target and autopilot takes care of doing the flying for younot supported sorry
poasting to support a subidea
yes
one thing annaa suicide gank is 100 guaranteed destruction for if you are not destroyed you are banned for breaking eve1v20 for example is not 100 guaranteed destruction there is still a chance of lag or something saving your buttsuicide ganking is the only form of pvp where you will as the ganker lose your ship no matter what
1 read the insurance contract2 lag is not a game mechanicfeature implemented by ccp so it has absolutely no relevance whatsoever in determining insurance payout3 lag can apply to the victim as well so u want to punish ppl for their connections and for ccps mistakes just so they cater to your incompetence4 lag applying to a suicide ganker results in the victim saving his own butt just like in low sec00 no gank no criminal flag no concord no difference at allgot anything else besides yet another sorry excuse to be babied
really not sure about this one ganking is a part of the game and there needs to be risk for all by the same token the cost to gankers does need to be high enough to discourage casual gankage im not up enough on current insurance values to determine whether thats currently the case though i do know that after making more rensjita runs than i care to think about over the last couple of years ive never been successfully gankedbut then i will put 20k meters cubed of high value stuff in a freighter rather than an indy and i will fly all the way manuallywhich i think brings us back to the mini freighter concept that everyone was hoping the orca was going to beif it really bugs you pay red frog to haul it and let them take the risk
thanks cyberghost for the linkagein my opinion it doesnt matter what rl insurance is like what really matters is the game balance when i first started reading the thread i wasnt sure where to weigh in because i dont have enough game time to really feel out the balance of gankageseeing as ccp had already voiced that they believed gankage is too easy however i am in support
i would like to propose the ability to set more hot keys in the hot key menu most specifically i would most like to be able to set a hot key for each of the buttons that appears in the selected object window when you have an object selected in the overview it surprised me that there wasnt already a way to do this personally i find it extremely annoying when my mouse decides that it wants to be slightly off with regards to which button it wants to highlight and being able to use my keyboard would completely alleviate this problem hot keys would also be beneficial to every one so long as they cared enough to actually learn thembecause it would be remiss of me to merely state this and not actually give a list of actions that i would like to be able to assign hot keys to below you will find my personal list if any one else has any requests they would like to make i encourage them to add to this thread with their own listactions that need hot keys 1 approach 2 warp to 3 align to 4 open target cargo 5 open my cargo 6 run a directional scan 7 analyze probe scan 8 eject 9 switch active target in the boxes at the top of the screen switch what will be shot at when you next turn on your weapons10 keep at default range11 orbit at default range12 jump through a stargate or worm hole13 dock with a stationfor the time being i cant actually think of any more actions that i regularly use that dont already have a hot key so i think i will go ahead and leave it at the list above thank you for even considering this request and thanks to every one for making the game as much fun as it is to playcatachan

nine issues is plenty to cover in two hours but there is some flexibility for example if a delegate says hey these five issues are all related and id like to raise them as a group to be voted on im probably gonna agree with that if it makes sense andwhile two 2hour meetings per month might not sound like a lot dont forget the other 24 hours of prep time per meeting plus all the other stuff that takes time working on action items from the summit followup with ccp on various matters discussions about process and tools and other admin sorts of things teadaze gets to do even more by putting the minutes together after each working meeting which is a job that takes several hours each timevacation in iceland makes me smile now that ive had the experience it was a ton of work the week before the trip the day before the meetings and for all 3 days of the meetings yeah we went out each evening afterwards and enjoyed the company of ccp folks but the legendary hard partying was pretty much nonexistent i stayed 2 extra days at my own expense to see some sights i was so worn out by then i almost wouldve rather slept but whatever im not complainingjust sharing an insight into the experience you cant really understand what its like unless youve been there yourself gavyou should run for csm6 seriously you are well spoken clearly passionate and if you get elected maybe youll find a way to do something to fix all the shortcomings you currently see in the csm and its processes obviously youre not ambivalent since you spend a lot of time posting wellexpressed opinions here about csmmeanwhile were doing the best job we can with what weve got what consideration we are given by ccp and the amount of free time that rl affords us for this volunteer effort while still leaving some time to actually play the game as to the question of whether csm is a waste of time well that remains to be seen im still hopeful csm5 will accomplish something positive and measureable yeah we are frustrated but will continue to do the work we signed on to do for the duration of our term once we hand stuff off to ccp the balls in their court as far as whether anything gets done with itand i think that situation has been pretty well discussed elsewhere all we can do at that point is follow up in a persistent manner keep players informed and hope for some progress
i might be able to blag it when it comes to knowing about anything bigger than a battleship but the main stopper would be ccps commitment to even having a csm of anything more than a token existence ccp seem to have significant resource when it comes to editorials marketing dust and hilarious youtube videos but they seem entirely reluctant to go to town on the whole csm thingi wouldnt have the first clue as to how one influences ccp into recognising the massive potential of independent appraisal and adjudication it seems to me that most industries worldwide have an ombudsman and watchdog organisation though usually at the national level which are generally paid for by the industry as a wholei would imagine that online competition is a huge growth area and whoever gets in first in funding and creating an industry wide framework of regulatory bodies with actual real powers would be in a very strong position indeed left to its own ea will probably do it and it will likely be very gaudy indeedat the very least the csm delegates should be able to demonstrate that they are capable individuals before they even get their name on the ballot and then they should get paid for the work they do its entirely bizarre that youre expected to sit in meetings with people who are being paid to ignore youyes i personally have little good to say for the csm as it stands today but i would be in favour of strengthening it in a correct manner dust514 is coming like it or not and assuming its da bomb or whatever the cool kids say these days there too an international competitive opportunity existswhat would a csm do for dust would it be the same csm could it even be the same csm i suspect notperhaps the ccpcsm should be discussing what the csm should be and how it can become something that can be brought to other products by other manufacturers for sure video gaming is a huge and growing international concern with massive amounts of taxable revenue that governments are going to take an interest in though possibly not until the next generation of parliamentarians who know what a consoul is take officeif there is one thing governments like its regulation jobs for the boys they havent left anybody else alone and they wont leave video games alone weve seen the mess they have made worldwide over things like age restrictions which results in many different logos on the packaging depending on where the product is from and being sold to as all the different moral organisations try to become the masters of what our children watch but where is our fifa where is our ioc where is our fiathats where id like to see the csm heading in the long term perhaps a decade otherwise it will get formed through legislation and the appointees will just be another predictable set of old school ties or even worse the existing bodies take their virtual counterparts into their own domain so fifa end up deciding up events in virtual soccer competitionsthe csm as it exists today some sort of marketing wet dream of a development idea filtering forum just seems like a massive waste of an idea especially as the events leading to its emergency conception dont bear any relevance to the csm we have
well gav i agree it would be good for us to sit down with ccp and spend some time figuring out what they want us to do and be exactly and howat first i thought you were just another idiot but your recent posts have convinced me that you are at least a sophisticated idiot  we need more people like you to provide feedback so we can improve on ourselves
the problem with this is first of all who decides who is capable certainly you wouldnt want ccp to do that the election system is far from perfect but ive yet to hear of a proposal that is bettersecondly the problem with paying csms for the work that they do is that it would be a corrupting influence consider all the complaints in the rw about the professional political class
i agree with you and gav both having a serious chat with ccp about expected roles would be a good idea of course its possible that those of us on csm might decide we couldnt live with expectations that are unproductively confining or too much of a departure from what has already been defined as the csm role in official ccp documentssokother discussions with gav in the forums here have demonstrated that he she is worth engaging in intelligent conversation
i would expect that the csm would require a permanent head position whos only responsibility is to ensure the continued operation and integrity of the csm and those selected to serve within it specifically they would not involve themself with the actions and decisions of the csm except to support and promote the organisation externally growing with size that ceo would require additional aides financial directors chairman technological expertsthe csm as a separate legal entity would be required to abide by local laws regarding corruption

it is clear that ccp does feel they need to send someone with a sincere look on his face to meet with and listen to the csm its equally clear that ccp does not feel obligated legally or morally to take any action csm recommends nor justify their inactionwhat can csm do about this well you can start quantifying ccps inaction howkeep a clear list of proposals that are backlogged prioritize them for example if there are 180 backlogged items make them 10 groups of 18 and each of you prioritize them 110 average out each of your scores for each item then instead of basically saying well they did many things we recommend like the skill que but they didnt do others  there is still 180 backlogged items you can give specifics of the top priority items say the top half of your proposals that have been on back log for on average of 2 years they have done 05 of the items yes there will be some things that ccp doesnt do exactly like you want but may still substantially accomplish the goal the csm can take a vote on whether to give ccp credit for what they did or not the priorities will change as the csm members change they will also change as the game mechanics change some proposals may become obsolete  the csm should vote them off the list if ccp actually gives a reason for not enacting a proposal that is a reason other than we are really busy with other stuff and at least engages the proposal with reasoned argument why they reject it that should be noted as well so players can see why they rejected it again the csm could vote on whether the actual reasons given is reasonable or just a way to push it off this would allow you to say of the 180 backlogged items that have been sitting in backlog for an average of 2 years there were 5 that ccp actually gave a reasoned explanation of why they did not implement it ccp has not given any sort of articulated explanation as to why the other 175 are ignored until this stuff gets quantified it will be very easy for ccp to make vague statements about what a great thing csm is im not saying it has to be this structure but there must be some sort of scoreboardthe other benefit of this priority system is that the players will be able to make a more educated vote sure everyone voted for this ui change or this fw change or ship model change but which candidate says its a priority this would allow players to make a more informed vote

hello csm peoplei have a question regarding proposals and the likelihood that a proposal will get a pass by the csm and implemented by ccpby a broad proposal i mean something that has a fairly wide scope for example many assault frigates are poor and need to be rebalancing heres ideas for fixing ship a b c d and eby a specific proposal i mean something that has a very narrow scope for example the hawk is a poor ship and good improvements can be a b and ca broad proposal may make it seem like a lot is going to be changed at once even if it could be implemented over the course of several patches coming from a software background large changes are scary a specific proposal would come across as a small change and easier to control and if enough of these are passed over time you end up with the desired end resultdo you feel that a specific proposal with a very limited scope has a significantly higher chance of being passed by the csm and implemented by ccp if this is the case perhaps we should let people know and we can start to adjust our proposals accordingly

if there is one thing that i hate beyond measure it is when a neutral remote reps someone resulting in me losing the fightthe least that could happen is if i were allowed to kill the neutral remote repairersupported beyond 100
remote repping is no offensiv or aggressiv action so why should it get aggro timer thats like saying a commandship pilot whos just there to give bonus to fleet and does not enter the fight must get aggro timer as wellplain stupid  not supported
i too would like to see this problem fixed but on the other hand im using my logistics purely when i get blobed so before u implement something like that fix blobsalso i heard falcons are still good tools against logistics
u are getting it wrong rrer should get same aggression timers as rredexample player a shoots player b player c reps player a player a cannot dock until it stops shooting  1 minute in that second that player c repped player a he gets same agression timer if he did one cycle of repping that mean 1 minute of no dockingjumping if he is still repping that means no dockingjumping until he is repping player that has 1minute dockingjumping session timerif player c reps player b and player b didnt shoot back then player c doenst get any timers
you mean like autocannonsi demand more range
acs work great my mach is brilliant
as an avid blaster user your idea of more range is total crap more dpstracking same range
your reading comprehension is in the same category as gaylente ships pretty bad
i feel it is time to raise these issues againthe improvement to courier contract size and the ability to deliver a courier contract by rightclicking on the courier package were great additions in dominion and have done both the setup of courier contracts and the completion of courier contracts to a much more enjoyable taskthere are however many other improvements that could be made to the courier contract interface to make it even more useful for both the issuer and the contractorwhen setting up courier contractsit is difficult for the issuer of a contract to see how much m3 he has added to the contract until the contract is nearly finished some kind of counter for the m3 would be useful a size column in addition to the quantity column that already exists would be an easy fix although a sum of the total volume would be much better both would be bestadd a warning when someone enters an assembled ship into a courier contract that the insurance will be void currently warnings are only given on exchange and auction contracts better yet make the insurance resume when the ship is back at its owner again as long as the contract is not failedwhen searching for courier contracts it would be useful with more courier contract friendly filtersfilter on route security max and min security rating for systems along the routefilter on collateralfilter on rewardfilter on trip length number of jumpsfilter on distance to pickup systemfilter on volume max and min volumebetter sorting options related to filterssort on collateralsort on rewardsort on jumps to pickupafter accepting a contractadd a show contract to the menu when rightclicking on a courier packagemove deliver contract away from repackage and break contract from the righclick menu on a courier package in a station corporate courier contractsadd a role for accepting courier contracts issued to a corporationmake it possible for contract managers to see who in a corporation has accepted a courier contract issued to the corporationmake sorting of contracts better currently it is impossible to sort courier contracts properly after completed date or time left for outstanding contracts when you have more than 100 contracts outstanding to your corporation and you sort on time left the oldest contracts appear on page 2 not page 1 as you would expect last but not leastgive us a contract api for personal corporate and alliance contracts as well as an option to export particular contract details in an easy way to our computer for further parsingi will gladly invite a dev or a csm representative to our corp for a few days so that heshe can experience the issues with courier contracts firsthandps updated title slightly
sensible and reasonable suggestions
locin has offered a concise list improvements from which everyone who uses courier contracts would benefit they apply to an issuer an individual hauler or a corporation that relies heavily on courier contractsit is a remedy to the pain that can only be fully understood by those who use courier contracts constantlythis proposal gathers my full support
a very detailed and relevant enhancement request i support this 120
this is a very good idea there is something for all sides are concerned dealing with contracts thanks for taking the time listing it all down for the devs and also want to thank the devs in advance for thier time
contract api please would also be great if there was a way to pass courier contracts between pilots it would help corpmates assist one another and possibly use a dispatch system
supported courier contract ui is terrible in oh so many ways
learning skills are going to be removed i approve of this method
this can also be supported in a rp perspectivewhat did the characters do in their universitybefore the were created by player how could all of them graduate without knowing anything even how to learn
ok having read the various threads and thinking about it some more im willing concede that the keep learning skills as is crowd arent completely1 full of iti think we all can admit that the learning skills are mostly bearable in small doses you dont need to train charisma if you just want a pvp pilot you dont need 55 in perception and willpower before you train frigates v we dont need to save every possible minute of training for us old timers the learning skills were more bearable in the old days because we had a choice as to when we could train the learning skills our attributes were fixed no remaps and there was no accelerated training bonus so it didnt matter if we trained charisma to 54 right away or put it off for a few years it wasnt a big deal if we stopped training the learning skills to switch to a short term skill that provided more fun factorthe problem is that newbies no longer feel they have a choice on when they can train the learning skills newbies can get almost 16 days of learning skills before the 16 million cut off evemon optimized attrubtes no implants any day not spent on learning skills becomes two days of trainingboredom laternewbies also get two remaps the first remap can be used to maximize memint for the learning skills this gives the newbie one final remap with which to focus on their primary interest further remaps are a year away thus theres a strong incentive to get the most out of your first remap which means training the learning skills to a high levelthe accelerated bonus time and two free remaps make it possible to and encourage newbies to specialize in training the learning skills specialization by definition prevents choice its this perceived lack of choice that has caused the learning skills to become so hated recentlytldrthe learning skills arent the problem the accelerated training time and two initial remaps are the problem1 mostly is a better word im all about compromise 
sign i would be more than happy
good bump
this i could adn would gladly support its not a out of the gate bonus package for instant gratification and yet still gives the ability for people to ignore the trainign skills and go for the fun stuffi think this is a very possible thing and could be worth actually discussing after all why wouldnt people encourage others to maximize there total trainign time when such an obvious push method is set in place to accelerate it from the get go not to mention new players dont get a feel for eves true training speed until after the 16mil mark
totally supportedi really hate learning
thats a very intelligent way of looking at it nicely done sir its not so much of a choice when the system blatantly gives you incentives to get them out of the way the above idea of slowly giving attributes over time not only makes sense but also as the above poster above me shows draws a larger crowd into the supporting area given that it removes instantgratification from the argument this could be the compromise that sets such an action forward
supporthopes this solution could help newbies to real enter this game faster and easier
support
a very good suggestion taking several weeks on learning skills is boring to everyone especially the newbies
supported please ccp hurry up and do this
that would save players a lot of time and help rookies get into this game quicklygood idea
good idea
bad idea
good idea
it should be a great changenice
dont agreedifferent learning plans show the difference of different characteristics and stragetics although a 54 or 44 learning could be the standard is that good to learn xxx to lv5 is still a topic worth to be arguehmm if you think the learning skills block people from join this game boost the speed bonus could be a solution just reduce the training time for noobs to get 54 or 44 then left them to make the lv5 decisionwe need some difference for even counterstrike still has different weapons
i believe the learning skills are all the evil sources kill them as soon as possible
nice
not supported
do keep in mind as the op has both stated and linked to in a fanfest video that ccp devs have outright said that ccp has already committed to eliminating learning skillsthis thread is about how to go about doing that not if they should be gotten rid ofi think you are forgetting one very important detail the old characters actually started with a decent set of applicable skills the new characters now start with almost nothingwithout the accelerated learning time new characters dont have much of a leg to stand on
no ccp has said that some of them have regrets about introducing learning skills and at that time they did not see an easy way of removing them they have not committed to do anything about learning skills for all that we know the more recent changes to the npe may have resolved their concerns about learning skills as it has reduced the time spent training them in halfthis thread is for players to discuss their opinions regarding the future of learning skills that includes voicing the opinion that they should be keptyou seem to have forgetten that old players started with even fewer skills than current characters and did not have accellerated training times those characters stood well enoughi would love for my army of alts to get an instant upgrade to 55 learning skills i could abuse the extra training speed especially if i decide to create some more alts i would also love to redistribute my learning skill sp to some other skills so that i dont need to waste time boosting my characters charisma or training at a lessthanoptimal rateallinall i would come out well ahead if ccp follows the ops suggestion however i suspect that it might be overpowered on the other hand i thought that 800k sp for a starting character was overpowered when it was first announced i thought the same again when that was change to doublerate training for the first 16m sp looking back i see that those changes have turned out alright therefore i expect that the removal of learning skills would workout just fine as well
yeah i like this idea its cooli cant stand people arguing about different plans of learning skills thats a waste of time
agreed new players experience of gameplay should be determined by their skill specialisations not some redundant learning skills any training that doesnt end in a new module ship or module enhancement is really boring to do 
i like this idea very nice
as a new player that just started playing a month ago i support this idea
not supported
not supported very very bad idea
as a new player who is a little more than two months old i do not support this ideaantisigned
as someone whos trained them 54 or 55  get rid of this abomination called learning skills
thumbs up
i have to agree on this suggestion having to reset my 4 planets with a combined total of 49 extractors is a pain in the arsethumbs up
id give this a thumbs up but my hand is packet so tightly from carpal tunnel damage that i can barely move my wrist at allthis message was written with my tongue
this will effitiently create an army of alts that are just trained for extraction  which will make all your stuff worthless you sure you want that to happen 
one of my friends plays since 2003 and is still in a noob corp he calls the game eve offline because of course of the unique way you can train in eve and because he plays about 10 of the time the rest of the 90 of the time hes offline gaining spseve is unique and what i propose is directly in the line of what it has as features already
ok heres the deal eve ships are visualy lacking in my eyes eve is falling behind in personalization of assets other then the ability to select which modsweaponsammo go onto a shipbefore you continue reading i am a college student specializing in network admisition and computer desktop support and id like to see my ideas at least make it to alpha testingmy idea is to allow players to paint there ship im not talking make a custom skin in photoshop and upload it so every one has a unique texture im talking about having a bunch of presets that allow players to at least mix it up a bit 1 the textures are already there mission ships t1  t2 ships all youd have to do is add a feature to allow some one to select which skin to use on their ship this would add zero server lag because people already load these textures every day and we arent adding any2 a slight upgrade from above uploading for example 5 or 6 differnt camo colorspatterns and a player is allowed to pick between them this would not lag servers is textures are kept client side the ammount of data tranfered between server  you machine would be a name of a file or part of a file camoraven2jpg for example how much do you possibly think would cause even if it was being sent to 50000 people i send more data in a text message from a iphone3 have a white texture on all ships now that might sound odd but it allows us to use a system seen in games like fable 2 armored core and more it allows us to break the texture into two zones or more if we chose and have a preset pallet of colors we can pick which zone and which color we want to apply to that zone and make hundreds of thosands of combinations this would create a little lag computer side if your computers old and limping on one leg to even play eve in the first place but like 1 and 2 not a noticable ammount of server lagnow how would you be able to use one of these 3 features should they be implimented1 color rigs have their own specific rig slot much like the subsystems of t3 ships depending on which rig you place in depends on what preset texture your ship becomes works with ideas 1  22 have a window that pops up while at a station comes default on all stations even 00 eggplatforms acts like insurance or repair you select a ship though the window you can select your look works on 1 2 and 3 and preview like the fitting window your ship before finalizingand as a final added feature add a graphics option in the menu under this menu you have 1 button this 1 button is an effect button like missile effects and so on that are allready there it can be toggled on or off though a hotkey in game to drop graphics levels for big fights or heavily populated systems such as jita for those who dont want to see the features listed above just leave it offfeel free to make suggestions or modifications to my idea i will bump them up to a secondary post i make after this one specialy for that so they will be at the top and viewable for readers with out having to search though the entire threadtrolls you will be ignored i dont dignify your actions with an answer if you say no and give a reason why other then it will create lag or its a crappy idea i wont consider you a troll
holding spot for viewer submited ideaschanges
i think everyones expecting the whole personalisation thing to come into play around incarna when they redo character designing and possibly add a personal space customising ships will put a large amount of strain on the servers try loading everyones portraits in jita local then imagine trying to load everyones personalised ship colour combinationsas much as id like all my amarr ships to look like khanid navy ships its not really the top priority for me 
really theres 101 thing already ed up with eve already brokenmissing features faction warfare drone ai the whole ui etc etc etcand youre worried about how pretty your ship is really go back to playing the sims or fable or whatever and try takinga marketing class or something while youre at it costomized paint is pointless useless and distracts ccps already short attention span from bug fixes and other things theyve been promising to follow up onnot supported
i like this idea actuallynot sure how theyd bring it in or if it would change the look of the game in a bad way but since when was more choice a bad thing
reviving it because it wasnt kept active it wasnt rejected and untill it is ill continue trying
i think the fact that it wasnt kept active is because it was rejected if people dont like your idea they probably wont post in the thread now will they
supported
amen to that
i think i supported one of the older purposals on this but on thinking about it it might cause some problemscurrently bookmarks are stored on the eve servers not on your local client foulder the calls for bookmark locations would therefore all occur on the eve cluster itself not on the local client then being sent to the clusterpile a bajillion bookmarks on top of a gate or something with the same number of people sitting on the gate and youd have a serious crapton of exploitable lag like bubblesonly invisible if ccp can code it so that the calls for the bookmark locations dont really bog down the clientsnodes during other activities pvp pve station spinning while looking at pr0nz then the ability to see bms on the overview would be great
they are cached on the client
thumbs up from me
whether a player is new or old doesnt really matter as someone who has been in the game longer will always have a slight to strong advantage this is perfectly fairas the t2 ammos are worse than thier t1 counterparts then they are unbalanced and need fixingnerf t1 ammo

isnt this crosspoastingalso youre not a representative of ishukone youre an imposter
i am an agent for good trying to release technology ideas that will benefit capsuleers of all occupations also now hiding from the posting police for alleged crossposting crimes fight the power

yes thats very nice but it is crosspostingroleplayers UFFFDUFFFD
yes by encouraging people to hotswap implants on a perfight basis or even switch out of implants in order to pod themselves for the bounty on their heads furthering an existing exploitbutnotreallys existenceremoving risk is something we arent fans of in this game if you ignore the bleeting sheep on the forum anyway
you can hotswap ships and modules at a station why not clones especially implants that affect the ship you want to now useyou can already jumpclone to a nonimplant clone to be podded for bounties so again there is no difference there is no reduction in risk by choosing implants when i fit my ship because of the process is the way it is now i do not use multibillion implant sets because i dont wish to be stuck in them for another 23hrs after ive finished the need for them so instead there is less risk because im never going to loose them because im never going to buyuse them in the first place
because implants are not ships neither are they modules and the whole intention of them is that they are costly you lose them when unplugging to deter people hotswapping them and that the choices you make with implants sort of mattersby removing this you act against the gods ccp and thus you are bordering upon the act of heresy you will be held accountable for this heresy heathen
wow you genuinely believe people want thisyou know what i agree with you i also want the freedom to swap the rigs without destruction on my ships and hell swap to whatever ship i own no matter where it is in relation to where i am id like a lot of thingsbut you know whatrollingstonesyou cant always get what you waannnntrollingstones
such things were said in the labs when we were first looking at the prospects of this technology i will reiterate what was said thenthe argument about hotswapping would be an issue if it is performed in combat this is not however how the technology works its impossible implant racks are sent from datalink via the ishukone data centre and can only be retrieved and activated via a station or smathe way it is now is more a hinderance to potential risk implants are things that enhance your ship and well you should be able to use them when you want to use that ship having to wait 24hrs is not increasing any risk its just preventing itcapsuleers would like to use expensive implant sets they would be using a multibillion probing implant set when they are probing another expensive set for their falcon another one for their tengu billions in isk all ripe for the podding the current system especially those in wspace isolated from stations but fighting extremely hostile unknown forces is very bad capsuleers are restricted from utilising top technology because of the current jumpcloneimplant relationship

op please post the topic here
warning i am going to roleplay the part of a designeryou used the wrong fontroleplayedit i think this is a bad idea not only from a riskreward point of view you gain the reward of increased shield at the risk that you may lose an expensive implant set  being able to switch out of this implant set at a pos is a bitwell too easy and from an rp point of view implants are physical things if you wanted to hotswap them youd have to hotswap great big chunks of your clones brain as more than one clone of the same person cannot reside in the same station at any one time would you  or any surgeon bar sansha be willing to operate on a live clone in order to remove the old implants and replace them with the newwhats that you cant move your right hand sorry your implant swap has resulted in the penalty of movement minus everythingi can has rp
the idea has more flaws than merits hotswapping is not something to be sought it is something to be avoided and i am sure the lords will smite this idea from afar when they see fit to slot it into their busy smiting schedule
thank you wish i found that place before i posted
oh great so thats three subforums itll be in dies
good instead of one set of people now three sets of people can laugh at your ed ideas
moved to assembly hall at the request of the op
oh boy he actually did move it here now he can be officially shot downanyways links to where ive already given my input on the matter
ideas that are presented to ccp that ccp agrees to should be implemented currently there is no tracking when the issues submitted agreed to and accepted by ccp will ever be implemented tasking priority is determined by ccp and as currently being reported there are no set amount of development cycles to deal with many csm proposals  i am paraphrasing here  see mynxees blog
wouldnt it be nice if missiles came from somewhere other than an invisible launcher in the center of your ship does the idea of making torrent missiles live up to their name and bringing a storm of death and destruction on your opponents appeal to you then have i got a proposal for yougive missiles hardpoints like turrets already have and more importantly nonecenter origin pointsthe sheer coolness of my idea can be summarized in three words macross missile massacre now before you guys freak out i do not  in any way  want missile spam my proposal is not to change the number of existing entities in a missile launch  8 grouped launchers fire only 8 missiles but the simple fact is missiles irl dont simply follow the most direct route towards targets  they need to be well launched having these streaks of light emanate from launchers adds visceral excitement to the otherwise droll usage of missiles and as a drake pilot god only knows how frustrating it is to have launchers but have them completely and utterly ignored come on ccp you can do better than thatoh crap looks like that guys got blasters lol yeah right better keep my distance unless i want to be ganked by a noob seriously now we can already tell how a gunship is loaded roughly from a visual standpoint  its just an extra sure and ship scanners exist but sometimes you wanna see if that raven is a lightlyarmed support ship or a missileladen banshee from hellnow to address some opposing issues others exist and feel free to bring them up debate is good for these mattersill grant you that there are plenty of little things that ccp could fix but this proposal falls into the realm of things that would greatly improve the graphical treat that is eve online i know im not the only missile guy out there not by a longshot but we seem to be pushed aside anyways balance issues of course are a big part of it but so too is the pretty colors that other guys enjoy wow how exciting we fired an orb of white light at the enemy  lets just say that it contains 6 missiles and let that be meanwhile turretusers are able to get the visual experience of watching a broadside assault on the enemy with anywhere from one or two to eight turrets unleashing their fury on the target missile guys get a single nondescript blob if missiles could be treated as turrets or even launched from designated missile bays on ships rather than the center of the ship it would take eve another step closer towards matching any offline spaceshipz games in the intensity of its graphicsreally because you know you can chainfire fire one at a time launchers may not be as efficient but each launch generates a unique entity and if you are moving as you launch or if the target is moving each has a unique track need i say more directly opposes this point next
continued from post 1this is true and certainly a strong factor against my idea i realize that the current turret weapons are essentially hitscan weapons with instantaneous impact when fired missiles however are actual objects that have a programmed flight time this said my proposal addresses this by introducing turreted missile launchersbays it would make it so that missiles are no farther from the target than regular gun turrets unless im very much mistaken turrets have their range already predetermined by the center of the ship not by where the turrets are placed accordingly a dreadnought mounted with guns aligned parallel with a target will not have the forward batteries hit and the rear ones not hit the target optimum range notwithstanding all are treated as if they were fired from the center of the ship just graphically offset to appear to emerge from designated turrets missiles would be no different in this regard while the inevitable whiners would petition because the missile appeared to have come from somewhere that was too far away the simple fact is that eve is already rife with issues of lag and positioning errors correct me if im wrong but nothing is determined visually on eve servers  or else giant fleet battles with the amazing sidewaysflying caps wouldnt be treated as a matter of course well there are complaints about lag but thats a different issue altogether this point was summarized well by a fellow supporter hereperhaps the biggest roadblock my idea has yes now i could simply say lol but what about stations exploding and missile impact effects and leave people with lesspowerful systems in the dust but many people who say this forget about a graphics option in your menu  turn off turret effects would it be so difficult for ccp to do the same for my proposal  a turn off missile barraging or similar toggle if they go so far as to implement it then surely thered be a way to turn it off for people with systems that arent up to snuff  just like every other visual effect does
this hearkens back to counterpoint 2 the server can already handle unique missile tracks for each manifested entity this argument hinges on the lost tenth of a second while the missile launches and orients during which a few hundred meters are lost if your missiles are already pushing maximum range then there really should be no problem with adding this overall change  if you missed it your missiles do a little jink at the end of their burn when they hit their target indicating that the server has deemed the target to be inrange by the time the missile reaches it and no matter how the target is moving the missile will hit the target at that point no matter what although of course the efficacy of the impact depends on the missile type target speed etc extending the range of this final stage by a few hundred meters easily offsets any questions of whether the missile lost flight time while launching  and quite frankly if a target is right at the end of engagement range most missileers will not at all be surprised by a miss given the fact that the target is moving possibly away and if it was towards you then they will definitely hit anyway if you start going omg i launched exactly at 655 km but it didnt hit wtf this sucks then you shouldnt be using missiles such inaccuracies and inconsistencies are only to be expected indeed it could be taken as a step towards making eve more realistic well if you know what i mean eve obviously isnt realistic  do you launch your missiles right when you hit max range and hope they hit or do you wait 5km or so like say i already do anyway to make sure a hit will be guaranteed my proposal changes nothing but visual effects when alls said and done
sounds good especially visual cue for missile mounted hardpoints cant tell a neut phon from torp ganker atm but can tell for neutblaster domi
i have to say that i was very excited when i found out i would be getting a free ship from ccp erm ore whatever anyway i want my free primae but neither my main character nor my titan pilot can get it whybecause i dont fit in npc stationsnow i could try to dock in an npc station but the last guy who tried to do that with his nyx made a big frakkin hole in it and started an rp war it was pretty serious stuffi dont want to start a war i just want my awesome free ship for pi why does ore hate supercap pilots were people too
seriously its just not fair youd think the ore ship delivery fairies could sneak your free toy into your caps ship maintenance bay wrapped in a ribbon and everything
this is an outrage i will gladly raise the flag and crusade against ccp to get justice for my fellow spacemani think the solution to this pressing issue is to finally allow us to dock in titans then since he is a station he can get all the free ships
when the speed changes arrived ccp nerfed the web strength considerably the problem imo is that the stacking penalties for webs that worked fine with the old web strengths are too severe now when compared to the existing peak web strengthseven when piling 34 webs on a target you can only get the speed of a target down to about 8085 of its top speed which isnt enough to hold something trying to get back to a gate andor dock range i propose that stacking penalties for webs be completely removed so that 34 webs will reduce a targets speed to 5 or so 1v1 encounters wont be affected that much if at all and those that choose to sacrifice their mid slots for multiple webs will be rewarded with increased effectivenessccp has continued to change the game in favor of the defender and this needs to be reversed
webefiers have no stacking penalties do some reasearch before you post please every web cuts the speed of the target in half its as simple as that
pretty sure they didnt change it so webs should still have stacking penaltiesi like the way bellum is thinking but then reversed massively increase stacking penalties of webs now only encourages blobbing single targets in gatecamps higher stacking penalties for webs  more fights less ganks to be honest didnt really think of it myself got the idea from some shc topic where someone proposed only one ecm module per target
supported
yes more research is required before posting but not by the op anyways webs are not supposed to be able to stop a ship completely any more regardless of how many are used that is why their strength was reduced in the first plancestacking penalties remain in effect thank you
if a player is blobbed hes dead anyway all the above does is help solo players complete a kill instead of allowing yet another target to get away
no if you jump as solo player in a gate camp you can gatecrash and survive you want to make the blob stronger thereand only the blob your proposal doesnt help solo players in any way afaik webs have normal stacking penalties so second web is still 87 effective which is pretty close to 100 no solo player will ever fit more than 2 webs and that is already very special so the only thing you will boost is blobs
you talk about equal  fair as if this were a game of basketball while it is a game it is a game with a very strong foundation in war  combat these are subjects i can speak on from personal experiencelets look at a real world scenario through your eyes for a secondim in afghanistan on a patrol through a village when we come under small arms fire one of my guys is able to determine that there are 4 little bastards holed up in a little building so i tell him to grab 3 more guys not 4 or 5 or 6 but 3 and go kill them as they attempt to engage 2 are killed and a third wounded because some bleedingheart wanted war to be fairnow the real life versionim in afghanistan on a patrol through a village when we come under small arms fire one of my guys is able to determine that there are 4 little bastards holed up in a little building so i maneuver either through side streets use of smokecovering fire to get close enough to put a lot of bullets and or explosives on that structure making sure to utilize all the personel and assets i have at my disposal to eliminate the enemy if i am unable to accomplish any of the above tasks for whatever reason i will asses the potential for civialian casualties and collateral damage and if the situation warrants i will have artillery or air support level said structure to ensure that the enemy is defeated decisivelycombat is not fair thats why we have sayings like peace through superior firepower not peace through fair and equal firepowerif you want fair then you should probably just cancel your account right now and move on with your life
another stupid assembly hall idea
oh nice a pvp arena as a solutionnot supported
i am opposedit canbe installed jump clones to it jump to operation area with the mining ships inside of it and ppl can jc out to it
he means that the mining ships can use all those things to get there the rorq simply use its own jump drive
well why not
i like itwhy shouldnt industrialists get a ship that is capable of creating a jump bridgeit certainly makes sense ore has all this money and they decide nah well just clone jump a handful of pilots instead of enabling a massive mining efforti think notapproved
the idea itself is good but that ability should not be on a roqualwhy its simple roqual is simply to cheap that ability should come at a higher price around 1014b build cost like supercarrier and maybe give it some neat features and not just jumpbrigde in short all the things the roqual is missing
right now the customs office does not show up on the directional scanner put it on the directional scanner so i am able to find pi care bears and kill them
ccp has strange habbit of not adding new stuff they introduce to the scanner first the probes not the cargo link this needs to be adressed
i hate to agree with redoverlord on well anything but she may have a point
couldnt you just add the office to your overview and scan for ships in that directioni dont understand what adding it to the d scanner will achieve
this sounds more like a bug did you report it already
this
its called specializationopportunity people who skilllonger and spend more isk deserve better stuffs in that area than those who dont having it segmented instead of just having the max and the minimum also lets players gain something from each level they dont do that evenly very often but they do it in some circumstances gallente get an industrial for each level of industrials trained for instance where as matari get 3 and the amarr only get 2 the practical explanation is they probably didnt want to waste so much time on modeling 5 kinds of inudstrial ships for each race the roleplay explanation is probably that different races prioritize trade ships differently concerning pi i think riskvsreawrd being balanced by startup costs and planning if you plan ahead and put a really advanced colony down to start with you can keep it running until you decide to delete it no one can blow it up or take it from you yet so youre only really playing against yourself in how you use pi at the moment later on when actual pi conflicts become part of the game you might want to control your risk level through keeping your colony costs low instead of putting up the best possible colony you can basically i think its more important to give players enough choices so that they can play the game the way they want than it is to keep it simpleps theres 3 sizes of control towers in the game anyone else think thats odd i dont

anything that makes it easier to set up courier contracts are supported by me
if you want to respec go play wow

hate to break it to you but getting people into low sec has nothing to do with missioning the obvious place to go for people who like missioning is high sec and the people who come out to low sec for the most part couldnt care less about missionsthere are other far better incentives possible then god awful boring ass missions you know incentives that would actually appeal more to the people who live there
you want to populate low sec do you really really want to populate low secthen remove ability to scram ships which dont have warp disruptor or scrambler fittedthere you gowithout backup or meta gamingusing pve fitted ships in place where everyone and theirs grandmother can web and scram you is idioticbut i can feel big waves of no is coming this way not because you are genuinely interested to fix broken low sec or some diversity in mission runningbut only new targetsand when i say new i mean less experienced players who are desperately trying to grind for theirs plex and after it theirs new and maybe one of the first ships for pvpyes thats the reason why many people are doing missions not because they are hamsters and want to have hundreds of billions of liquid isk but to afford to pvp
dynamic agent quality is great the key to herding mission runners is to focus on their strongest common characteristic greed exploit that and theyll go wherever you want them to
you know why this wouldnt last long because of lo sec pirates strongest common characteristic stupidity theyd drive their prey out to extinction again leaving lo sec as dry as it was before and then in their all mighty glory wonder what happenedstill its a good idea so gets my thumbs up
yes for dynamic quality in high sec no for low sec and 00 why would you want to punish the people running in the 15 remaining low sec mission hubsno need to create larger disparity between agent quality what would it add the disparity is already more than large enough if anything make it smaller you can make low sec more popular than by higher bounties are more lp there already is a security status modifier of lp no need to improve low sec by higher agent quality when it is way more logical to improve it by just increasing that modifierthen contrary to what you propose dont make 05 better bounties than 10 they already get way more lp and that difference should also become smaller since there is barely difference between 05 and 10 then remove all difference between 01 and 04 space for bountieslp it is just plain stupid to keepadd that since there is for players no differencestill this is all nice and dandy but you can already make quite a bit more in theory in low sec the problem is how easy it is to kill a mission runner for a pirate without any significant risk or challenge either the mission runner isnt tackled and he survives or he is tackled and he dies until this is fixed you can do what you want with low sec you wont get more easy ganks there which is in the end what you wantand lp payouts small have you actually ever bothered to run missions in low secwe have had better proposals imo andwhiel i wouldnt say before you add dynamic agent quality it is a good point
though i dont agree with the probe idea i agree that cloaked ships are too hard to find rl if we had cloaking it would not be 100 perfectly indedectable you cannot hide mass you cannot hide heat you cannot hide eletrical or magenetic fields energy output from sensors radio communications between ships and probes electronical systems heating and wearing out set how long a cloaked ship can stay cloaked untill it drops to cool down or something every cloaking device or form of camo in history has a flaw time to add one to eves cloaking and a way to find that flaw
take note gallente navy stop disguising your ships as trees
can we also make black ops less useful so that they can be used even lessthere are things that could be done to make covert ships harder to use  perhaps bump skill requirements but i think that actual cloaking mechanics work properly

thanks already have all relevant skills at 5 yes including astrometric rangefinding with sisters equipmentive had this discussion before and wont waste my time with angry people like you suffice it to say im quite capable of staying aligned when my mission gets busted its still doesnt fix the profit ratio once my mission location is compromised and camped to hell you seem like the person that wouldnt understand this anyway so ill keep it at thatas i said you wont see it youre locked into your own tunnelvision the scanner is well and dandy happy how does staying aligned make missioning in low security space profitable does it protect my mission spotprofit i dont expect you to understand this but docking my profitearning ship to do anything else including pvp runs my profit to the ground anyway i wont be discussing this here anymore its a waste of time arguing with the elite pvp is the only way crowd of eve  you all have yourselves a good night

this is a minor issue and im not sure if this is exactly the right place to bring this up but its kind of annoyingever since i trained remote sensing i cant see a planet in its natural state anymore i either see a dark blob or a white gradient whenever i pass onei feel that i should be able to see the natural planet textures when i am not in planet mode
we all heard a lot of promises and things during the election process we should be keeping track of who is taking their position in the csm seriously and who lied their ass off just to get free trips and free account subscriptionswho out of the csm are actually following thru with what they said they would do and who is doing the worstno trolling and keep it on topic people
this seems slightly premature since weve not even been in office for one month yet but im curious to see what people think as time goes on and by what metrics we are judged considering that achieving the metric by which we are popularly judged eg the number of csmsubmitted issues to be implemented ingame is essentially hamstrung by forces totally outside our control atm
you are really asking two questions1 are broad proposals likely to get lost in the backlog and never get dev time answer absolutely something that is going to require multiple devmonths is just not going to get done unless someone in ccp has their own reasons for pushing for it but such proposals may influence their thinking2 is it tougher for broad proposals to get approved by csm answer somewhat mostly because we all understand 1 so were inclined to pick stuff that might actually get implemented in the near term were just being practicalthe way i am trying to approach this problem  which may not work at all but im giving it a shot  is to try and craft shotgun proposals with lots of subelements that can be independently implemented and still provide benefits to the players
how about organizing proposalsissues by scope you have broadgeneral categories and specific ideassolutions so you sort the specific ones into general categories and bring the category to ccp with all the collected solutions and ideas that got voted into those categoryso nothing small gets lost and the big issues also get addressed often enough overlapping with the small ones ccp can then pick and chose what to do out of the plethora of options and ideas giventhis could also be used to organize collection of issues in the assembly hall where people can support a broad issue and bring in specific ideas to solve that issue which can gather support by itself and can get put into the categoryimho the assembly hall should only be used for supportingvoting on ideasissues and all solutionidea development been done in the fi forum threads are then simply crosslinked where appropriatewith this organization discussion and voting would be more organized and clear as people dont need to discuss a specific idea on the assembly hall obfuscating the actual support for a broad issuealso broad issues will no longer be dismissed because the specific solution voted on is not to the liking of the majority voting would then be whether or not such a category should be opened and then specific solutions can be voted to be bundled in as option for a solutionafter all one of the purposes the csm has is to channel and sort player feedback for ccp
andrea i think small specific proposals have the very best chance of getting done especially if they simply involve a tweak to an existing mechanic but in reality it all appears to boil down to how csmraised issues coincide with stuff ccp is already planning to do or what they are willing to make room for last couple of csms there appears to have been little to no synergy with ccps development cycle at all once the summit minutes are published i think youll gain a much better understanding of the nature of csms frustration in getting ccp to take action on any of our issues the dismaying thing is that it probably wouldnt even take that much to reverse negative opinions about ccps lack of responsiveness if they did even a handful of small discrete changes from csms backlogged issues in each release both the csm and the community would begin to feel hope again im sure positive messages would ripple throughout the community as a result that certainly wouldnt let ccp off the hook but it would demonstrate that they are listening to the communitymeanwhile we sit and try to figure out which approaches will increase our odds of success kinda like youre doing
in a perfect world this would be a good idea but to expand on what mynxee just said there are communications issues that csm has to resolve with ccp before we can try something so ambitious we need to get specific feedback on what parts of such proposals are the most feasible and be able to iterate them down to something that ccp will agree to and the players will accept without a quick feedback loop large proposals are doomed other than as source material for a ccp insiders petproject which will then probably include things that the players will hate because csm wont be consulted until its too lateif our bright and shiny new stakeholder status is to have any real meaning csmccp interaction has to be a much tighter loop than twice a year

thats great
this video does not say that they will they want to they have decided tobabababa solve the problem by removal of learning skillsdoes itand this   and anyone who wants to silence other solutions in this way  you can stop nownot removal is not the wrong post hereso lets back to the topic how can we make the learning system better by dealing with learing skills
not and let me repeat that again not supported
support
its a good idea to remove them because they are annoying for new players nah i would go as far as to say they are annoying for all of usbut heres a question what will happen to my 45m sp in learnings on nearly all of my 8 toons i mean that counts for a total of 36m sp and they are not even close to have payd back what ive invested in them ie skilltime so i would expect that if learnings get removed i see them reinbusted thought the system ccp intruduced in the last patch otherwise im against removing them because that would be like cheating me ie taking something from my toons without any return after all i payd for that skilltime 45m sp in learnings are around 2 month skilltime meaing 30greets
absolutely having all players training at the same speed is completely ridiculous because erm stuff and things
yeah because all the evil noobs trained cybernetics to v and have spare half billion of isk lying around ccp better dont dare to make the game more noobfriendly
please ccp hurry up and do this
not supported keep the skills ccp

i do not see how your idea will help eve not supported
supported learning skills are part of the problem for newer players 3 months training learning skills before you even leave station dump em and reimburse the players for their wasted time
this is funny because its a blatant fallacybut okay keep believing what you want to
i just returned after a 2 year break i ran some of the old level 4 missions i was doing 2 years ago and they got boring just as fast as i remember im not quite skilled enough to make them go quickly so they drag even worse than normal pi has been very interesting at least the set up but the biggest thing that has me thinking i might actually stick around for a long time this time is explorationi think the basic mechanics of exploration are a lot of fun  scanning stuff down is cool the whole treasure hunt feel of it is great the probe interface moving them around triangulating positions  amazing space sim  exploration stuff im impressedbut magnetometric sites are pretty much taking the wind out of my sails these should be the best sites for an explorer  rare archaeology that takes hours to find but is sometimes worth big bucks instead its a constant disappointmenthow could they spend so much time making such a cool process like exploration and then totally screw it up at the last minute by not juicing up the loot table it doesnt even have to make me rich but i should definitely not feel like i would be making more money by afkmining some veld in a retrofitted stabberand im not even getting into the more developmentinvolved possibilities for explorer loot stuff like treasure map type items something that would actually appeal to explorers i guess i feel much the same way about exploration as i do about pi  great initial execution great setup very fun learning curve but the long term rewards in the case of exploration or the maintenance pi just ruins the whole experience
they need to drop much better rewards if theyre to be worth scanning out and theyre absolutely terrible compared to their sister radar sites having them drop a small amount of tech 2 salvage would be the obvious solution
intact salvage is the probably the answer it needs to be seeded
absolutely not
having to wait for skills is probably one of the most important features keeping customer retention rates up  this will seriously hurt eve especially people that have been loyal customers and supported eve will hate it also many people will gain an unfair advantage when game mechanics are changed and they are first in line to abuse it also it is impossible to calculate training loss because skill training rates vary a lot less than 450 sph to 2772 sph which makes things even more complicatedi really hate this idea and im certainly not alone you should use a different subforum for your idea you will hardly find a majority that supports this which is fundamental for csm issues
its just a less convenient variant on buying skills for thumbs down
if you properly read all that has been said youll see that no valuable reasons have come up to counter my idea
i cant help but read that sentence as im right and i refuse to acknowledge or address any opposition as warrants a proper debate
supported i dont really see how it would imbalance the game
supportedplease give the goodness back
supported i have heard plenty of people that want this to happen i know there have been several threads that have been put up about it as well over the last few years i dont quite understand why it takes so long to redo ship textures like the scorpion and the other ships dont get overhauls as well and if you are going to overhaul the textures why not implement a basic system like this its not something you need an expansion to dedicate toit doesnt take a marketting class to show that if a product is broken people wont keep paying for it if you have problems with the program take your own advice and go back to playing fable or the sims ccp needs to get their product straight these threads are to show what people want implemented to make the product better do we honestly need to tell ccp to fix lag or update a ui that is almost 10 years old if we do we shouldnt be buying their product that being said at least they have the balls to address issues when they occur instead of trying to cover them up unlike some other game producers out there and make users deal with it for weeks on end  like the autopilot bug last weekhowever these threads are for suggestions not putdowns if you cant comfort your manliness issues in game well again see your previous advice or maybe you need to go back to my little pony or hello kitty island adventuremaybe people dont post because these threads can be rather hard to scroll through all the posts that exist on the board i mean i havent counted them but thats because i have better things to do like go out for burgers with friends enjoy fresh air blow peoples ships up so i wouldnt quite call a lack of interest a rejection since gaining notice is the first part of gaining interest speaking of blowing ships up though do you usually fly based on blind assumptions because i wouldnt mind blindly coming across you and making a blinding flash out of your shipbtw ccp can deal with issues of thread abusers actually thats their job here not yours
i dont think you understand how the assembly hall works ideas dont get rejected they just get passed or ignored as for the idea itself its nonterrible but id wager that the technical difficulties are far higher than you would ever believe and thats why it hasnt happened
the color rigs idea is awesome  exactly what i was thinking from just reading the title  and is probably not difficult to implement copy and paste rigs code  change the effects  done i know it is easier said than done but the concept is really simplesimple idea simple implementation a great deal of fun why notif ccp fear it is going to make new eden too colorful just make it superexpensive to do a paint job like it will be as difficult as getting the officer items1
instead of a paint shopmaybe make it an industrial processing thingimplementing each item with a color option when it is produced would clog up the market quite a bit since youd have color options but industrialists could potentially take a base item modify it and make it a color which could be lost when repackaged so people could still sell the said goodgives industrialists a way to burn off extra cheap minerals and compete on a per order basis rather than 001isk price wars on the marketonly question is how would you change the color of a rigged ship ah well youd lose the rigs on them to repackage them as is so what does it matter
1 of courseyou would obviously only see and get from the server your own bookmarks so if you make ten bilions of them around a gate for whatever ed reason you only lag yourself to death
i do think out of all the things mentioned so far this seem the most feasible idea and the easiest to implementwile im in here i do not think it would take away from pi or would make it a step closer to wow
makes sense and it takes a whole 10 seconds of coding work why not have it ccp
i too am frustrated by the corporate hangar and ship maintenance bays being closed when my orca docks undocks or jumps between systems
yeah this is dumb
look while dierdras proposal for ccp to actually focus on the many issues plaguing the game is a step in the right direction i think ccp needs to for a single expansion focus on this above all else we need no flashy new features no walking in stations nothing like that we need ccp to put a shine on this game implement features that have been promised and make whats already there better for a short list of possible things that should be fixed laghacking specifically python injectiongraphical errorslearning skillsstupid agression mechanicsbroken t2 ammoui updatestreatiesdid i mention lagid like to point out this is list is by no means complete feel free to post additional topics that need fixing in your commentsif your art team will get bored have them make a primae class salvager or tech one tier 3 bcs for each race or something
wouldnt be no lag a new feature too
fully supported
you can wish  no one can stop you but ccp is allready spread thin on incarnadust
wtb better aggression mechanics no more station games plox
ill support this but im under no illusions ccp will not listen and will continue to pump out halffinished untested and badly designed features rather than ever focus on fixing existing content
im under no illusions ccp probably wont listen to something like this unless it becomes a megahyper threadnaut like dierdras proposal even so it cant hurt to try and if ccp does listen to their customers having this idea out there is good
buttes
 what they said
i have gathered together as many of the good pi suggestions as i could find into a single omnibus proposal which you can read here
many great ideas allthough i am afraid that making rescanning extractors to easy will make pi market crashremember we have no way to eliminate competition  yet 
can you explain your concern in more detail in other words what is the chain of consequences and how would you tweak things in order to mitigate them
i would wait with this particular change until we can conquer planetskill other people infrastructure
many people  myself included  are avoiding pi because the level of clicking involved is too high as the interface gets less godawful people who are avoiding it might start participating in it thereby increasing the supply and lowering prices as someone who fuels several towers i like this thought but its an entirely believable consequence same reason why i think that inventors might not be as happy as theyd like to think they will be if ccp ever allows batched installations of science jobs
but by that logic ccp should actively try and make pi as mindnumbing as possible so that it has fewer players therefore less competition for producers which means higher prices until the point where the profit is so high that even herschel yamamoto will throw himself into the hell of ten thousand clicks if someone can make a plausible argument that a particular feature request has unintended consequences great  thats the kind of iteration i want to see and that i want to encourage ccp to do with csm and through csm with informed players but gee this might cause prices to change wont cut ityou of all people herschel should be in favor of changes that favor thinkers over clickersor did you perhaps forget your sarcasm tags
to be honest pi is completely unsalvageableccp designed a low level micromanagement design with no higher level strategy at all its a carbon copy of pos reactionsas such no matter how much you refine the ui the underlining mechanics prevent the feature from being meaningful in any waya better system would work by taking the current one and replacing the micromanagement with a macro view of the planet managing colonies from a high level strategic view with optional micromanaging if i could just tell my colonies to extract in a general area and produce whatever and optionally directly interfere with that process the system would be much bettera simple area of influence could represent the area in which you can build growing by planting special pins similar to the settlersanno when two borders touch there is a conflict zone tiein to dust border influence should be influenced by shippingproducing military related hardware which neatly lays ground work for dust while opening room for territorial disputes over local resourcesthe current system lacks any opportunities for high level gameplay interaction competition or conflict its a purely mechanical systembasically any minigame that i lose to simple recorded mouse movements is garbage pi is such a game
oh dont get me wrong i support making it easier carpal tunnel is a medical condition not a game balance tool im just saying that when you remove the pain from painfulbutprofitable game activities you usually remove a good pile of the profit too its not enough to make me stop supporting itespecially for a game mechanic i dont even partake in but i can see why itd be a concern for somethe more i think about it the more i agree with this guy pi is based on farmville when it should have been based on simcity or civilization im not actually sure how it can be made into a good system
yep same here im really curious how ccp is going to build all that conflict and combat for dust into pi as it is nowo
this the only fun part of pi is the first part setting up everything then it just stops making people click a bunch of  for no reason is not game play its just pointless make work
actually thinking about it some more pi devs should probably take a look at the settlers 2 for a game that features a map of localized resources area of influence and complex micromanagement combined with high level strategy with conflict added in
completely agreethe very basic level of pi is designed in the way which inevitably puts us into a bottleneck  anything that is left to improve is a way to clickity click more comfortablyit is not even a minigame a game element is present outside of pi  watch markets decide what to produce plan your hauling etc pi itself is not a game at all  just apply some planetary layout which are already designed and then just click click click for many years to comesorry to sound so pessimistic current pi implementation can have lots of improvements ofc and proposed ones are well thought out but it is just like doing a makeup for a corpse it will look much better but still 100 dead
trebor i havent touched pi at all because i find the whole concept more like my rl job than a game with none of the benefits like rl money that said youve obviously put a lot of hard professional work into your proposal and ill support you even if only for that also i voted for you and i like to see my tax iskies being put to good use
processors should be given a setting that allows them to consume more than 3000 units every 30 minutes this toggle could be found under the stats heading and have 3 levels level 1  as it functions nowlevel 2  double the processing 6000 units processed into 40 units every 30 minutes at a cost of four times the processors normal cpulevel 3  doubled again 12000 units processed into 80 units every 30 minutes at a cost of four times the processors cpu againwhat this does is allows planets to use all that extra cpu they have and prevents planets focused on extraction from having to devote half their powergrid to processing some of my setups in highsec permarun 56 processors with only 7 extractors i assume its far worse in nullsecthis also helps alleviate the supply crunch going on in p2 and p3 products and makes p4 production less of a logistical nightmare even more so if the toggle is also given to advanced processorsalso one suggestion thats been brought up that i didnt see on your listmake links cost no powergrid only cpu encourages more spreadout colonies stops punishing pi setups that dont keep links as few and as short as possible
not sure i agree with this one you want to impose costs to make people think a bit more about colony design but if you get a fi thread going on this and there is significant support i will add itas for the processor tweak im more dubious about that one just because of the extra programming its going to take  it might displace fixing 23 other things that would be higher priorityi understand that some people have shall we say strong feelings about the pi design but realistically it is not going to get a fromscratch redesign so the issue is how to iterate it into something that more eve players will like and use
the point is all the whine about how much time it takes to restart the processors is simply not true i just checked my daily restart routine and watched the time used 80 seconds for one colony with 12 extractors this is hardly much considering that it has to be done only once a day if in 23h mode so making it even easier is basically giving out isk for free if you cant even be bothered to invest 10 minutes a day why should you get any money at all from it
awesome i got movedplease consider thiswormholes contain the top end content in eve pvethe wormholes this content can have different effects shield tanking wormholes armor tanking wormholesthis content at this top level requires group team workthe nature of wormholes also involves scanning pvp and is isolated from empireso you have an environment that is dynamic shield tank op this wormhole armour tank the next one change to scanning ships to find themits endgame eve you use the best ships you use the best modules you work in groupsyou can swap ships you can reconfigure ships but to use implants with this top end content is near impossible hence the ultimate reason for the changes implants and jumpclones do not scale well with content for the basesimple user its not an issue but at this end of the park its messed upthe suggestions i have made are trying to address this in the most elegant manner possible please think of the entire game i have had lots of posts from people that have probably never seen the inside of wspace they make generalised catch phrase statements such as want it all risk vs reward choices you make without actually making valid arguments one day you people that are not effected so much by this might have multiskilled characters in wspace running c5c6 sleepers and you will understand where i am coming from the implants tied to jumpclone system has some real issues with modern wspace content
ohhh mai gawdok earlier i thought i had found the worst ing idea everthis however is even worseim not even going to bother describing why this idea sucks or waste time explaining how this violates about 80 bijillion different elements of ccpeve traditionhell no not supported
i thank you for your detailed point of view you argue the points well can you please answer some simple questions i am interested in your replyhow long have you lived in deep wspace how do you find the ability to swap between your implants in wspace do you think that it would be a good thing to use your scanning implants when you want to use your scanning ship your shield tanking implants for when you want to use your shield tanking ship your armour tanking implants for your armour tanking shipdo you run sleeper sites do you run different armourshield gangs on sleeper sites depending on the wormhole bonusesdo you even use combat implants do you fly more than one ship in a 24hr periodwhat is in your opinion the best feature about being stuck in your implants for 24hrs
not supported  i want to kill you with your expensive implants in your head an laugh
sigh another reply with no substance did you read any of the thread linked in the op did you read the part where i explain how i would love to actually use the multibillion isk implants but due to the nature of the 24hr timer it makes it totally impracticable that the current system actually restricts risk vs rewardmost likely not if you really did read and actually comprehend it it would have been nice for you to at the very least explain why the implants tied to 24hr jump clone is good gameplayanywaywell i have played eve for many yearsthis the only suggestion i have offered and most likely the only one overall i love this gamei am sorry that the particular opponents in my thread fail to realise that the result of this change would mean more risk vs rewards not lessdespite all the posts i still do not see anyone bringing up any good game play points in implants being tied to a 24hr jump clone timer there is no good risk vs reward in the current wait 24hr mechanism the risk is actually rather lame haha you are now in scanning implants for the next 24hrs because you wanted to userisk a good scanning ship  is not good game play it is particularly evident in dynamic wspace and stifles people from using morebetter implantsbeing able to use implants that are specific to what you want to do however does provide good game play as well as great risk vs reward potential i have wasted enough time trying to explain all this on the forums so i shall retire from my threads and get back to the game i hope intelligent people can understand the issues and what i am talking about lots of 3 ccp and capsuleers eve is an awesome game wspace is the bomb keep up the good work
the assembly hall is an outofcharacter forum next time try something like make implant sets separate from jump clones so that we can switch implants without needing to jump across the galaxy and no not supported
while this sounds appealing its not actually a practical way to run anything for one the csm is an advisory body not the boss for two im not going to demand that it get done the way that was specified on the assembly hall if ccp comes up with something bettermore practical id like to see ccp follow the csms lead more often but this isnt the way to make that happen
not a practical way to run anything the one tool we are given is to propose a change this is a change is it not for the last 5 csms what has actually been done that we the player base wants
not all change is desirable or practical or likely to happen there are better places for csm to focus their energies than this
moved from jita park speakers corner
while it would be great for settling debates like the ageold jihta vs jeeta one this seems like a good way to promote interface clutter without actually adding to the game its not worth it
already an active thread on this however you presented it much better i like how you used pointcouterpoint to show whats good and bad about it alot of threads these days are gimm3 th1s n0 g00d r3az0n i just w4nt 1t1 and when people say its a bad idea the op gets poed and counterattacks will require some ships to have slight modding others like the drake and rifter already have have built in missile luanch points dunno how ccp would change ships like the hurricane which doesnt have a single point where a missile could possibily come from also you have the pheonix which is a few km long if one luancher is at the front one in the middle and on at the afk you would need to be closer for the one in the aft to hit the target but then agian who said that the visual missile has to be the actual missile they could just make the missile eye candy and have the actual missile basically invisible sadly i dont think that ccp will ever do this they are too busy adding useless and half finished additions to eve like piedit forgot to support
supported this issue is especially annoying with ships like the drake where the ships origin is actually in empty space and you can see the missiles appear out of nowhere i think anyone who says it would cause too much lag is just desperately searching for a way to knock this idea and keep eve conservative cant see why it would cause much lag considering turret ships have up to 16 separately moving models with multiple rotating parts that can shoot in multiple directions just make missiles have turrets with big chunky barrels on them problem solved for ships like the drake and crow just place the missile origins at the preexisting launchers maybe

because of all this rage on the forums about learning skills i thought id put in my 2 cents on a possible proposal please feel free to support it or criticize it so here it iskeep learning skills in the game best possible solution in my opinion as anything else would polarize the eve community too muchintroduce a new skill with prereqs learnings to 44 or 54new skill can just be a 1 lvl skill which will knock a certain skills rank down depending on the base rank ie rank 3 becomes 2rank 2 becomes 1rank 1 becomes something like 75 of itrank 5 to rank 3 and so on kind of like a sliding scalethis proposal would benefit older players as well as motivate newer players to actually train the learning skills
even as a supporter of learning skills wow no youre actually saying the solution is to add more skillsto be frank all of the anti crowd will be on you like ants on roadkill thats their main point of contention
that would make the problem worse there are two perceived problems with the learning skillsa theyre boring and should be removed from the game on general principles andb because of the two free remaps and accelerated training bonus new characters feel the need to spend the first month on training the learning skills which is a bad way to introduce the gamethis proposal solves neither problem
this isnt the first time i or others have said this but as a learning skills supporter i feel the best way to anger the least amount of people would be to give everyone the learning skills and use the new sp reimbursement system to give sp to the players that already trained them
1 shadows are quite annoying and to those that say thats how you determine the plane just do a side view of your probes
as any bustling tradesman will tell you keeping track of the dozens if not hundreds of individual orders can be quite the timeconsuming task just as individual market items can be placed in folders in the quickbar tab i propose the same should be done for the selling and buying sections on the orders tab for current and future orders for example say you make a majority of your money producing a multitude of battlecruisers instead of looking through your list to check on those individual orders you can instead place these orders under a folder you designate such as manufactured ships another possibility would be to have the wallet remember what orders you create and put them in their folder category automatically advantagesquick easy access to specific orders of greater importance to the user easily keep track of specific orders that are frequently updateda cleaner order interfaceif the wallet remembers order categories moving an item into its category is only needed oncedisadvantagespotential increased server load for remembering categories a simple checkuncheck system could alleviate this howeverinstead of an order list with individual items itll be cluttered with foldersmore work putting each item into its own specific category

hugs maratbh sok is a smart and pleasant guy in rl sorry to out you sok i was rattled and disappointed by the dichotomy between that and his imo unnecessary mention of spoongate which was clearly going to wind up the trolls so i raged probably in conjunction with a hot flasherrr i mean power surge that accomplished nothing but feeding the trolls more and certainly didnt reflect the kind of image i hope players get of csm which is inspired in part by the behavior of its delegates but hey as you said im only human and you knowim better now the men in the white coats said so
i could put my scout alts in individual oneman corporations if that makes you happier

there is no reason why we should wait till the term is half way over much less towards the end to give constructive criticism on csm members performance it should start from day oneyes as a csm member you can only do so much and the rest is left up to ccp we all know this but that should be not waved around as a copout for justification for just sitting back and doing nothing while enjoying the perks of being in the csm
oh i totally agree and i wasnt trying to imply it should be just making a practical point 
politics is all about expectation management
make people expect nothing from you and that way all their surprise will be pleasant

while it would be great for settling debates like the ageold jihta vs jeeta one this seems like a good way to promote interface clutter without actually adding to the game its not worth it
i would like to support this endavouri have been playing eve for around 5 years now on various chars and have once again started a new fresh characteralthough it will take me a while to get back to where i was in game ie cap ships etc seeing alot of unfinished rushed content is going to end up breaking this game and our sandbox that we all love and enjoyi would like ccp to hire a new team of about 1520 developers just to finish off and polish the old content or if it cannot be fixed ie learning skills then make a new system altogetheralthough some of the fixes may not please everyone im sure that many would be glad of the fact that the issues were fixed andor implemented properly as intended when they were first developedplease also keep on top of the lag situation and exploits and cheatersim also sure that the community would like to see more action on macroers and other cheatersexploiters as well and also some developer feedback about what you are doing to combat them and how the war against the macroers is goingi would personally like to see ccp be more open and transparent with the eve community everyone loves to read dev blogs 1 for the op fully support this as a returning 5 year player to eve only gone for 6 months and missed the spring patch

lol these days ccp is the running joke of eve in my group every single feature they introduce seems to be bugaddled and not only that they tend to break features which already work i love eve and i have for years but ive come to hate the developer to the point that sometimes i can barely bring myself to log in thereve been bugs in the game for years on end that get no attention while we get to hear about how awesome their new awful features are going to be or about how dust123 or whatever the hell is gonna be despite the fact that its not even gonna be on pc which i play eve on and then the hyped feature comes out and its like planetary interaction which is still a gigantic pain in the ass not streamlined even to a workable extent i have to click a thousand times to start a cycle to create a mere handful of components why should i ive played simcity even today the only things i personally want out of it cost less on market than the individual components they requirelast great free expansion we got shot by our own poses the one before that ccp botched their muchawaited sov system with a malfunctioning outpost ownership swap and as a bonus half the time i joined a fleet i couldnt interact with fleet members i cant even remember the fun bugs prior to that but theyve had the module lockup bug in game where a repeating module will redlock as active when you double click it for years which is lol for hictorshonestly what is going on here does this company have zero qa or something fing supported

come on already
this is a complete lack of respect for the customer base the font was good 6 years ago when 1024x768 was common but come on ill gladly give away my 100k sp bonus for the ui give the players something they really need

im with the crowd that says if youre going to remove learning skills then you only reimburse the sp put into the learning skills and nothing else why should you get 10 to your attributes after the skills are gone strip the skills and drop everyone to the base level stats instead that would even the playing field just as easily with less concern about giving all the older players some sort of rate adjusted sp bonus for what should have been this supposed 10 the whole time
supported learning system is the worst game design it kicks lots of new player from eve
this
i vote yes remove learning skills and imburse the invested amount of skillpoints
oh this again obviously most people dont like the base training speed since they pick up the learning skills in the first place its just that not everyone likes the means for acquiring itis the proposed solution something for nothing absolutely they could look at alternate means of new players earning the learning skills such as gaining them automatically with time played or on finishing the tutorial etc but its not strictly necessary ultimately ccp will decide how fast they want newbies to advance in the game in the beginning if thats faster then they do currently so be it if a few veterans cant handle this tough
let me propose a solution and you can tell me what you think it really is not that well thought so any input good or bad would be appreciatedgenerally from what i can understand the problem with learning skills is the time you have to put into training them especially the second set the first one includes only rank 1 skills so its not so tragic as far as the second one goes i would propose a change from rank 3 to rank 2now you have two categories of people maybe 3 including the ones that dont want to train them at all 1 the ones who are reluctant to train the second learning skills to 5 because of the days they would put into and as a consequence they feel disadvantaged training a rank 2 skill on the other hand is more tolerable2 the other ones who have already trained them could get the remaining sp back but in a way that would be fairlooking to other players get some sp per month for say 6 months until you use all the remaining sp about 125 mil or get faster training times for the same amount of spthis way you dont need to eliminate the learning skills at this point and the players that didnt train them wont feel at a great disadvantage against the other who would be taking back 125 mil sp compared to 53 if they eliminate the learning skills altogethertell me what you thinkcheersps i dont know if someone suggested the same thing againif so ignore it
all supported but the 3rd point sp reimbursement should be done with the new sp injection system
the authors solution was before the sp injection system was put in place im with the crowd that thinks ccp was testing out mass injection of sp with the 100k bonus
canUFFFDt find anything to disagree so i agree
worst idea evernot supportedthis is eve online not hello kitty online
learning skill were maybesupported
i love the idea
not supportedeveryone must suffer through the learning skillsthere are no free hand outs in eveasking for free attributes is like begging for iskplus its not that hard to stagger learning skills with conventional skills 2 learning 2 combat 2 learning 2 other skills there is a huge balance and it all works out nicely
even though i only began playing in 2008 i still think it would be nice to have these changes yes i have maxed out learning skills but if they prevent newer players from enjoying the game to the fullest similarly to me now i think the original ideas in this post are greatagreed and signed and hope newer players can get the benefit of these changes too
so many masochists playing eve it seems
it would fit the whole cold dark harsh universe that eve used to be a few years ago
heck yeah
signedi approve of this change it will allow newbies to get right to the interesting skills and allow veterans several million sp to do we they want withedit and yes learning skills are a deterrent to new players my cousin quit two weeks after he started because he didnt want to sit for 2 months doing nothing my brother decided to just play other games while the skills trained how is this good game design it baffles me how so many people are saying lolol dont like it dont train it quit if you want whiners i sincerely hope these people never run their own business mmorpgs are dependent on subscriptions want more content more updates more players  more revenue  more contentupdates not deterring potential subscribers is better for everyone employees and servers dont pay for themselves
you want a valid rebut to your assinine idea here goesyou know how every account in eve has three slots to create three seperate and unique characters well guess what neither eve nor ccp have any clue which is your main and which is your alt so the idea you are proposing is that any alt characters on a single account would be applicable for this instant sp i have an alt that was created years ago and have barely trained anything at all on him but who except for me is to say if he is my main or notto further crush your troll there is a mechanism in place already where you can spend money to get sp not sure if you realized this but you can buy a character from another player who wants to sell one you can do this with isk which incidentally can be bought for real moneybuying a character that has been validly trained is fine implanting sp onto an inactive character that was arbitrarily created at a time in the distant past is game breaking it would affect so much more than just the character receiving the sp if you cant see that than you are beyond reasoning with
1 main char are easy to notice its the one with the most sp2 like when you can claim a gift you could do it only once per account3 i said already that you could purchase a max of 1 year of unplayed game time worth and again whats the difference between paying now or later 4 buying a new character is a completly different thing and since eve have already those kind of features dont you think what im asking is mild compared to that thx have a good day
here is my proposal to the csmin july 2009 we were given an informative dev blog about the then cosmos and now eve gate amongst the information in this blog is this lineso far the eve online api has seen very few additions since that time weve still got titlesonly for eve mails nothing for pi huge numbers of bugs and quirks in the way the api functions and recently weve seen even more comments from devs that strange behavior is becoming more common skillpoint oddities and the likesince the release of eve gate weve had no support from the devs about the api or accessing any features of eve gate programmatically weve had threats of bans for crawlingscraping though the eula and tos have not been updated to reflect this and weve had no response to any queries weve openly put to the devs on the matter of new api features for example full eve mail access  we only get titles in the api and fixing old bugs weve had one or two fixes in the last few expansions thats alli feel that ccp has taken the wrong approach with eve gate and would like them to reconsider the approach they are taking and potentially shift it social networks like facebook thrive on integration and applications eve gate offers no facility for either of these instead limiting people to only doing what ccp provides and only on ccps website in the way that ccp wants them to do this removes a vast amount of potential from the site standards like opensocial permit for high levels of integration without exposing personal data beyond that agreed with the application on install this is covered further towards the end of this postmy proposal is essentially to ask ccp to place an emphasis on making new apis on bringing support for third party applications and open integration into eve gate through existing open standards and to place a new priority on maintaining and improving the api to maintain openness of data anything that is available through eve gate should be available through apis with the same level of permissionspermissions is my other point because ccp has not made apis available a large amount of applications which require a users eve login to function have started cropping up this is going backwards before the api we had this situation where you had to give your eve login to third party apps for them to function clearly from a security standpoint this is extremely worrying the solution is easy  ensure api equivalents are exposed for all eve gate featuresin addition to this problem with the large number of api functions already available and the large number of additional functions that would be made available should ccp actually replicate eve gate features into the api a two or even three key system for api permissions is simply not enough to provide sufficient granularity open standards for application authentication and permissions should be adopted as a matter of urgency this would enable users to grant applications only the permissions that application needs to function and nothing else and would let users see exactly what an application will have access to prior to granting it access such protocols include oauth used heavily by twitter and facebookthe changes proposed above would not require a large increase in development time but would require nontrivial redistribution of time that would otherwise be spent on new features but i am confident the playerbase would in general welcome changes proposed aboveif nothing else ccp would gain a multitude of useful apps and tools which would increase use of their own platform rather than drive people from it increasing return on investment for invested developer time and cost by improving the user experience

thank you very much for your excellent recapim not too sure about evegate but the api definitely could be vastly improved and you provided excellent suggestions for that

surely this shouldnt be on page 6 i was under the impression something was going to be done about this a year ago and yet still nothing does ccp just not care about the ships that are rendered useless by this problem
gimme a reason to train them to tech 2 please
fleet fights now in hot pink and 5000 more lag to transmit all that manlyness data for all ships on gridthough number 2 could work but the logic isnt you would be transmitting the file name thats just ed and inefficient since its a preset list of options you assign each option a number and transmit only that single digitactually because eve transmits something to like python marshalled packets sending data on players on a grid makes your text messages look like just the word lol compared to a encyclopedia

very useful and there is no logical reason why its not possible already
haha highly advanced even  just do a passive align select warp to and wait for almost 75 speed and then stop the ship and manually set your speed to 75 that will most likely end up in optimal direction and you will be able to almost instawarp to your bm not very convenient but it works
having them as an option on the overview would also be awesome
i play eve on 3 different computers the only thing that gets saved clientside is all the foulders i use for bms the bms themselves get transfered between the clientsso either theyre on the server somewhere or magic internetspaceshipfaries are somehow transfering them for me p
of course they are stored on the server but also cached on the clientthinking more about it  it might be they are purely server side as otherwise people might abuse them to manipulate them on the client to make deep safes without warping aroundso yes performance might be an issue

does anybody actually use advanced ship arrays now the material penalty results in most everyone manufacturing t2 ships at stationsoption a in exchange for removing the 11 base material multiplier from advanced ship arrays increase the base time multiplier to 1option b alternatively rename all the current advanced ship arrays to rapid and introduce regular speed manufacturing arrays
ive run the numbers on it and for any good t2 ship bpos the advanced arrays do make good sense  your margins are fat enough that 10 cost for 25 time is still an increase in profithour a plantupgraded amarr outpost is better but not everyone has access to that that said just because theres a niche situation where theyre correct doesnt mean that theyre as good as they ought to be i see no good reason why we shouldnt be allowed to build t2 ships at their standard costs in pos lines id like to see a change of some sort added here
you cant make people go to lowsec to do missions if they dont want to if youre a highsec mission runner you are not risking your rigged pve fitted domi in lowsec  you are going to lose itlowsec missions already got a huge buff when factional warfare was introduced  huge amount of lps massive faction standing boost unique faction items in lp stores those who want to do missions in lowsec already have an option to make it profitableand no op this would not make people go in lowsec to do missions this would only create more tears on the forum and potentially make a few players leave the game because its not supporting their play style any moreplease when you suggest an idea dont be so selfish and at least try to respect a play style that youre not usingnot supported
unless something has changed from the last time i have run a mission without being in a fleet it is exactly how it work who kill the ship get the bounty it is only wreck ownership that is tied to the mission owner
make t3 logistics useful supported
t3 ships are not logistics ships doing this would step all over the toes of the t2 logistics cruisers its similar to giving the proteus 125mb drone bandwidth it would then would be better than the ishtar which is the specialised drone cruiser
no it wouldntlogistics have a lot of advantages over t3 which wouldnt change at all with better range
so your school of thought is that a t3 ship should never match a specialist ship even when the t3 ship itself is set up in such a way that specializes it
i dont necessarily support all the points the op brought up but a development cycle with no new major content even though i dont think tyranis qualifies as major content anyway is long overdue finish the last several expansions youve only halfdeveloped and fix the major bugs those expansions have introduced the game is getting worse not better and ccp needs to acknowledge that fact and devote their energy to reversing that trend
i would like to support a development cycle on fixing past issues and more polish of the features already in the game1
me seems to remember something about individual teams that work different sections such as development balancing bug fixes etcyour idea would just have half of ccp sitting on their thumbs doing nothing not supported
a complete year spent 100 on finishing expansions and fixing bugs will save eve from the fail cascade that is quickly approachingthe 6 month expansion cycle is eating eve alive with unfinished crapapparently dust isnt being developed by the satellite offices as promisedi seem to remember being told that dust development would not take a single resource away from eve development
remove local from 00 while your at it so people can actually kill the bots that infest it
im all for pos redesign i dont even care if its the focus of an expansion that actually revamps the game maybe they could overhaul the corp ui and the wardec system too that would make for a nice corporate system and should also pull people out of npc corpsive written quite a few proposals about poses and the wardec system which would work well but theres nothing more we can do until ccp figures its time to act as an excsm candidate please think of the majority of your players and fix these broken issuesfor anybody interested my idea on pos redesign is listed hereeven better make the nonnpc 00 local channel delayed for everybody but make an infrastructure hub upgrade which gives local to the controlling alliance this wont help most macroers but it will give the controlling alliance a great boost for defending their space and encourage them to actually own space rather than just isolated valued systems
supported even though there is faint hope of it ever happening
ccp never going to happen
you forgot rockets which would take 5 mins to adjust some values
i dont really think this is going to happen nor do i believe ccp will fix all the problems in a single expansion the best we can do is to force ccp to do it slowly over time
the point is this is a game and pi is a mini game it should be fun and engaging even at the slightest level something to make it interesting would be better then now
ok i did my ranting now lets do this refreshing of a corpsejust would like to clarifywindows and panes  move the pi interface into standard eve windows does it only mean making pin info window with the same functionality as others resizing color schemes  which would be good but not crucialor it means also moving the main interface the one with submit button into a window current fixed placement is extremely annoying and inconsistent with other ui of course this was noticed at a test phase and proposed and of course nothing happened
completely true i just want to discourage the one button to restart them all everything in eve should have an opportunity cost if the need to invest time diminishes the opportunity cost goes downpi mostly makes my 00 logistics a bit easier it is not the highlight of my day i wouldnt call it not fun because it saves me tedious trips to empire to fuel a pos
you deconstructed pi in just three sentences not bad
the latter everything but the actual planet backdrop should be in evestyle windows so they can be moved to suit the tastes of the player i have edited the proposal to make this more clearand tbh it would be nice to have the ship control interface visible when in space and in planetary mode any reasons why that shouldnt be addedi totally agree with the concept of opportunity cost i just dont think the cost should be mindless clicking just to throw out an idea as an example pi might be tweaked so that resource degrade over time so just clicking to restart all the processors has diminishing returns if however you were able to move pins then if you wanted to take the extra time to resurvey you could optimize your returns time vs profit and at least a bit of thinking involved  is the cost of moving the pins worth the additional income and how will my nearby competitors react
i dont have competition in 00 so far i do agree that clicking isnt the best way to go on the other hand we both dont expect pi to get a radical change in the near future as long as pi doesnt need much interaction after setting it up which is kinda fun there needs to be at least some effort involved timewise i dont think moving pins would change the way id do my pi unless i lose all my resources otherwise i already overproduce raw materials and stockpile them even without actively trying to do so i could not bother for 2 days until id start to run out i do not know how that works out in highsec though where resources are more scarce the best thing of course would be to redesign pi a bit to involve more interaction in the whole planetary thing as others already pointed out simply removing one source of funlessness without replacing the timeinvestment cannot be
great job in collecting alot of forum suggestions as well as putting in alot of thought i support

sounds reasonable
there should be a bidding process for empire wardecs if not mutual decced corp can pay to block wardec dec goes through if deccing corp can fork over more isk to concord losing bids not refunded it has the potential to become an enormous isk sink and benefit eve economy as a wholehighsec griefer corps wont like this but theres lowsec if you want unrestricted pvp htfu
the only person here who needs to htfu is you
additional isk sinks are of no benefit to the eve economy  they would in fact be an awful idea the idea itself is pretty lacking too  why do wars and mercenaries need such an overwhelming nerf
looks good merc dec costs are paid by employer as is currently the case it would just mean employer may have to pay more depending on target the mercs nerfed by this are kb padders whos hired by no one and therefore will have to pay up themselves oh well thats okayisk sink benefits game economy devs says so its also a rule in all mmorpgshtfu lol
why would i ever pay for mercs when just counterbidding the wardeccers is so much cheaper eve has been in a state of persistent deflation for several years if anything we need fewer isk sinks andor more sources ill wait to see how the tyrannis changes shake out because there were a few significant ones but those look to have been deflationary on net as well so i doubt theyll change my mind the only reason isk sinks are a rule in mmorpgs is that most of them experience crippling inflation eve does not because of its different game mechanicsmostly the fact that stuff blows up when you die which both dramatically increases the amount of goods you need to consume and dramatically decreases how much of a perfectionist you are with acquisition of those goods no inflation  no need for additional isk sinking ive often stated that i can teach someone economics in ten minutes but you have to actually spend those ten minutes
real wardeccers based on underlying reason wont give up so easily when counterbidded unlike casual kb padders and griefers people will still hire merc for both offensive and defensive decs based on beef pos spot market share or other underlying reasons depending on teary griefed noobie corps under griefers boots isnt the only way to make a living for mercs before ccp lowered dec costs mercs made a living fighting real wars no reason why they couldnt do the same againitem sink does not conteract inflation its the opposite fewer items available means higher value market responds to higher value by producing more items the current mudflation of top tier deadspaceofficer mods is due to too many people having too much disposable isk looking to buy them causing market to respond by having more ppl farming plex where they get comfortable and continuously spewing those mods isk sink is good for game economydespite what you may think mmorpg economy is very different from irl economy many of the same rules dont apply isk is created from nothing isk faucet and disappear into nothing isk drain its an artificial arbitrary system it takes very little knowledge in economics to spot this
what i said was that an item sink counteracts the tendencies that lead towards mudflation  namely perfectionism an everincreasing amount of money enters the game but each player only needs one weapon one helm two rings etc so that money is chasing a fixed and very small number of items theres also a market in lowerend items but that gets so badly distorted by all the rich highlevel players that the prices are too high for the people who need them and cheap as free for alts hence the need for cash sinks  the game cant handle any significant increase in the money supply per player without massive inflation on the handful of items that are actually worth buying eve has no such problem the demand for goods is vastly higher  i own over two dozen pvp ships and thats without any special stockpiling for combat  and theres nowhere near the same push for perfection yeah therell be pressure in different directions on different items and im not surprised that highend loot is going up as the rich get richer but if this is your idea of inflation youre simply wrong and yes i am quite wellversed in the difference between eves economy and rls there are some noticeable differences however inflation is pretty much the same in both cases the only differences will be the technicalities of how you measure money supply and price levels

i vote no you dont need to fit customized implants for every possible scenario when you cana use generic implantsb swap out rigsc bring extra or more powerful shipsd use a bonused ship such as for scanninge dont necessarily have to armor tank a shield unfriendly wormholeis there really any content or scenario that requires the use of highly specialized implants to successfully complete if not then allowing for the easy swapping of implants is just a case of one character trying be good at everything at onceyes i would love the ability to easily and quickly swap out implants but its not worth the dev time to work on it it wouldnt make even significantly better
thanks for your input d it is appreciated that is totally true but by that reasoning why even have implants that effect ships or skills then i do not also need dead space or faction gear either but i can use it if i wish to bring this down to the lowest common set up that would work is shrinking the sandbox there are 10 implant slots that can give 10 bonuses to your ships that is pretty significant the range of implants and ships rigs modules are so varied they work together however the implant side of it has both some signficant scalability and accessability issues you touch on the scalability issues when you stated lets look at this if my character only flys caldari ships and generally lives in hi sec running missions i really dont need to swap implant sets ever if i am a bit more advanced i might also pvp so i might have a jumpclone with pvp implants in or simply a clone with cheaper learning implants i stay in these setups for perhaps daysweeks or a player has a pve character and a pvp character both with separate implants these people do not suffer any kind of impact from the 24hr jumpclone timer relationship what inconvience it is minor and is just considered normal way the game ison the other end of the scale a player that has very high sp can fly many types of ships is very active and swaps between many ships and roles in a day this is where the scalability problems come in with the implant system as it currently is 10 slots of bonuses for those many ships but are stuck on 24hr timers and in jumpclones while that player can jump from a scanning ship to a pvp ship to a pve ship instantly in station or a sma he cannot do this with the implants that provide bonuses for those shipsthere is no good reason for this it has the effect as you saidthat is me right now and the point of my whole posting di am using generic implants i would like to use lots of good ones while i will be rewarded with bonuses to my shiprole i also have the risk of loosing those implants and the potentially large sum of isk i spent on themwas not mean to change the entire universe heh however there is more to this you see this change would actually open up the market more for these exclusive and expensive implants i personally also think it would see a huge uptake in people using implants because they might see how useful they can be learning implants have had a huge impact on the way implants are viewed by players when you start the game the first implants you will use are learning ones most people then attach the idea of risk vs reward in implants is based on loosing your learning implants or not eve is a much greaterdeeper game than that implants are more than learning they are very much based to your ship and ingame activities so then this leads to the accesibility issues you have great ship great implants great modules and a job you need to do for an hour scanning for a complex say while you can use your best scanning ship best implants best rigs for that hour you are stuck with your billion dollar scanning implant set for the next 24hrs i do not see how this is good or makes sense it stifles the use of implants it reduces potential risk vs reward its not something you would drop everything for but it has merits and should be considered at some pointthanks again for taking the time to read reply and reasons for your vote
current problem is that nanoribbon is the only valuable salvage itemnanoribbon costs above 5 million dodoixie at the momentneurovisual input matrix costs 450 iskthat is 11111 times difference meaning that everything except for nanoribbons is trash useless salvage often not worth the effort of hauling it out hershel has one made an excellent proposal you can read it in full here
removing one bottleneck will just introduce a new one stop posting it doesnt seem like anything useful is ever going to come out of your head
right does that it mean it should never be fixed
whats there to fix this is a solution looking for a problem
therell be price differences same as normal salvage
only if ccp is ed sadly i think that they are but i could design a nonbottlenecked industry system in my sleep and i guarantee that the transition would work better than the npctopi transition did
dysproprom  technetiumnpc trade goods  pijust saying
read the link in my previous post  i go into this phenomenon in significant detail basically ccp designs industry systems to have unavoidable bottlenecks t2 and t3 both have fixed ratios of supply fixed ratios of demand and the two dont match whatever has the lowest supplydemand ratio is the bottleneck anything with a similar ratioeg promethium dysprosium is valuable and anything else is trash salvage has supply and demand that both vary somewhat so theres no single bottleneck making it work a fair bit better and while minerals are very fixed on the demand side theres immense flexibility of supply meaning that theres no real ability for a bottleneck to format least not since the stealth buff to veld spawn last summer if ccp designed sane industry systems with actual variance in supply and demand options the bottleneck problem would vanish just as it has in the mineral market introduce comet mining for t2 goo while making ships consume a wider spread of materials for t3 have salvage ratios vary by sleeper class and salvage demand vary by racesubsystem poof bottlenecks are gone its not hard it would just require them to think things through but i suppose its so much easier to just up spawn rates on the current bottleneck instead and enjoy the threeday period before your stupidity becomes obviousalso max can you fix the capitalization of the thread title plz
normal salvage does not have a single bottleneck
wreck should belong to both victim and killer both should get aggro to a 3rd party that is looting the wreck and considering that the killer is the only one left on grid with a ship and a cargohold in that ship hes most likely the only one of the two victim and killer that can take the loot
so you would rather keep throwing laundry lists of ideas at them rather then having the ability to determine some level of importance  and more specifically allowing the csm to get a development cycle or twoall the lists of stuff to fix are awesome especially when now development cycles are not open for the next year
you want them to set arbitrary and pointless dates for what reason now it wont make them tackle them any faster also while trying to impose organizational structure to something youre not actually part of is fun and all its entirely meaningless to assume you know whats going on and how ccp works and how it should work is pretty silly
this would be far more useful if placed on the official wiki page of each system
explosion graphics need an overhaul toocurrent  a 2 dimensional explosion from inside the target blast radius is centred on the 3 dimensional midpint of the target object but the blast radius is only displayed by a 2d blastringfuture  a 3d explosion sphere centred on the outer surface of the target object im guessing ccp cant do realistic explosions for nonpromovideo purposesid always assumed those wedgeshaped objects on the hull of the drake were the launchtubes 
id like to see all the missiles in flight grouped and all striking at the same time wouldnt change but the animations would show all the missiles in flight
sometimes the answer for the most difficult question is obvious
and people wonder why csm isnt taken serious by manyccp
now selling sarcasm detectors starting at 2999
can we trade i get a sarcasm detector from you and i give you a reading comprehension 101 skillbooki realise perfectly well this is sarcastic which brings us to the point dont we already have enough pointless topics here without csm members also attempting to be funny
seleene why do you care like me id have to fly 10 jumps to the closest npc station in 00 to redeme the primae but for what  its not as if youd use it in 00 itll just gather dust for however longer you play this game we all know its practically useless as a ship
1 create alt2 give primae to alt3 4 profit
yeh we got that nowagreed on that  way too many useless threads here
i cant even redeem it in my home system because its not an npc station i mean why is that such a big problem its like yea you live in 00  go f yourselfits not only limited to supercap pilots i just dont see the point of this fully supported
lol great thread  i feel your pain
seleene since you did not need that primae anyway i just went right ahead and redeemed it on my account instead then i just self destructed it for the lulz joking aside i spoke to customer support and they suggest you submit a petition under game play ships and they will take a look at that naturally that applies to all super capital pilots
i dont need blue bars to still a better poster than you

some npc 00 does have direct empire connections curse and great wildlands pure blind geminate but yes i strongly agree that any new npc 00 should be heavily connected to empire

lets say theres 5 bs camping some lowsec gate we hotdrop them we then warp off to a pos in our supercaps or we warp to safespot and cloakthere should be a mobile pos sort of capship which one could fly about and essentially pop the pos forcefield it wont have a repel feature but it essentially makes everything within it untargetableit could be used for tons of thingssniper fleet protection making jita 44 undock a safe place or making a gate safe for a period of time

so i was blitzing through spore and i was messing around in the space stage then it hit me spore is kind of not really actually now that i think of it not at all you know what never mind this post like eveyou fly in a space shipyou have warp drivesyou have wormholesyou have colonies that you design to get moneyand when i thought of eve i groaned cough pi then it hit me spore was fun becaauseyou could fly around on planetsyesi am suggesting that using something like spore ie the arrow keys to move and the mouse wheel to go up and down to move your ship on a planet also to be able to see the buildings when your on a planet the problemspplz might escapae fights by this maybe no going on planets if aggroed or fightingpplz could ambush from planets maybeonly 10min on a planet then booted with a 5min wait to go back on same planetsince lag is a huge problem maybe fighitng something would boot you into space along with person you wowuld fightonly planets with pi could have people on them and a limiit of 100 to prevent excessive lagthis is just me going on and on but i want to see if people would want this or notwhy its fun and coolwhy not heres something i heard oncethe world of the mind is wonderful for the mind has no lag problemswoot first post for me in this sectionwoot wall of text
spore was funalso the majority of ships in eve would in fact fall straight out of the sky if they went that close to the surface of a planet you have to remember that most of those ships are a lot bigger than you might think just to look at them
and have roughly the same aerodynamic capabilities as a rock
there has recently been many threads  rumours  ideas about ccp scrapping learning skills changing skill placement being able to allocate skills at the start of character creation attribute allocation all of that stuff etc etc obviously this will benefit everyone but especially new players it will help with new players sticking with the game as its easier to get a run up at having a character thats actually usefulif ccp did ever decide to go forward with something like this i believe it would be a good idea to incorporate the skill selection  allocation process after the user has had the chance to complete the eve tutorial so they are able to understand the game a little more and see the benefits of each skill treepathi know when i fist started playing eve i didnt know enough about it to ever consider it a game that i would come to love at the time it was the old style character creation process where you could add attributes as i didnt understand the benefits fully i just chose pretty much at random
one free extra neural remap provided to new players alreadysolution looking for problem
the rewards are already insane with a single carrier and a cyno alt i cleared out over 40b in about 3 months of half assed effort i let weeks go by not even doing the missions cause i was getting rich quick and bored i never lost my ship because i paid attention to the scanner and stayed aligned pirates are only a risk to those who get complacent and lazymind you i was the low man on the totem pole there were individuals running 3 battleships who could clear 23b a day doing them there is no need for a boost just a need for people to get off their collective rears and make an effort
why do people think missions will make low sec better it wont pve is not the point of low sec in addition to which missions are more the fine in high sec mission runners and carebears will not make lowsec a better place to play
people who advocate those are pirates looking for carebear killmails silly this is why they should gate all lvl5 mission sitesand no 3 bs alt setup does not  carrier use 3 carriers one already cut through lvl5s like hot knife through butter with 3 people who come to kill you also send you killmails by the time those insurable carriers get killed theyve earned their worth many times over
1 open some free forum account2 place your important stuff on the forum3 4 profitas for your suggestion id say no the new mail system is far better than the old one
1 people delete their own mails like on every other mail ystem in use in the last 35 years 2 newbies are told to read the bulletin board 3 4 profityes we had all adjusted to the old mail system and figured out a few cool ways to do things but the new one is better
supported webs got nerfed harder than they should have it takes about 3 webs to keep a target from getting back to a gate it makes solo work even more unlikely and its the leas they can do after stealth nerfing suicide stations eve is supposed to be dangerous people who leeroy stuff around and dont think deserve to lose it if anything this game is becoming friendlier by the patch
so because tripleweb and quadrupleweb setups dont work well enough solo pvp is too hard
people are you stupid web never had stacking penalties period i dont know if i should laugh or cry i am ready to bet 50 million isk with anybody confidently misinforming or stupidly trolling here and claiming here that they do have a penalty if you are so confident mit me up in game and lets run a little test otherwise stop posting
not supported for reasons listed above it will not affect small fights very much and the large ones certainly dont need a buff in this regardand i will take the 50 mil bet on webs having stacking penalties but unfortunately all my chars are unavailable at this time
i happily take your 50m bet preferably with third person so i am sure i receive my 50m dunno if they do small amounts like 50m but otherwise i would really enjoy raising the bet so i can lose some ships again
youre not the one who posted the bet are you and unlike some others i keep my word when not selling mothershipsif maxsim goratiev wants to take on the 50mil he can reply here ill even log into sisi to test it
huh read back a bit i am not the one denying webs have stacking penalties so i happily have a bet against him maxsim not you to get 50medit btw saying you keep your word and proceeding with listing exceptions is not a great sales pitch
oh im sorry i thought you were replying to meand thats called being honest you might want to look that up
you are right guys there is a stacking penalty did some testing with my alt i am sorry for this now i am really wondering why ti is not in the item description like with other forms of ewar my apologies
so no 50m for me 
the trouble is the anti training skill crowd want free stuffthe pro training skill crowd see the investmentreward from learning skillspersonally if it was me id remove them give back the sp for them on people that trained themand nothing elsethen see how much people scream that learning takes too much time do something about it
and when ccp respond to this issue by increasing attributesbase training speed youd be totally ok with that right
this is terribly naive you dismiss their pov because you say they want free stuff yet you ignore that the main reason people suggest getting rid of learning skills and boosting everyones attributes is because it is the best way removing learning and boosting everyones stats bypasses the core problems with other suggestionswhether or not they reimburse learning skills is really immaterial to me  especially to those of us whove had them trained for a few years now but the reimbursement is not immaterial to the poor sap who just spent the 3 million sp training learning skillshonestly the only free stuff i want is for the game to be a better game  and removing learning skills is a good way to start down that pathand thats a completely ed view to take it slows down peoples progression in the game a lot this means that new recruits will take even longer to get their skills up to a place that is generically useful it gives players who already trained learning skills years ago what will become a 1015 year advantage instead of what is currently a 34 year advantage btw a 10 year jump in learning abilities is free stuffyeah whos the one wanting free stuff lianged and to the op no adding more skills is not the answer
no more learning skills please whatever benefits are conferred from the skills we have now liang shush now even if you think those arguments are insuficient to justify the learning skills theyre still there the time those skills take is easily enough alreadybesides the whole argument is moot ccp cant fix rockets in 2 years a change which is universally agreed upon and which merely requires changing 2 numbers then what are the odds that such a major change as learning skills reform will take placewe dont have a working bounty system after 7 years what chance has learning skills reformand so on given the whole slew of glaring design problems and inconsistencies that eve is riddled with learning skills are a very small fish in the pond dont invest too much emotional energy in to the idea that theyre getting changed
best suggestion yet
absolutely needs font options beyond those that ccp has givenccp must design this game with absolutely huge monitorsive been in the game since 2004 and am getting tired of waiting eves playerbase is older and getting even older anyone who loves the fonts must be younger than 30 and they just dont know whats coming for them
your name is awesome especially since its a technically correct term
a bit disappointing to see you fall into the familiar nonsense where anybody who disagrees with you must be a forum troll when troll means someone who sees things differently than i do rather than someone who deliberately uses dishonesty in order to cause conflict andor annoy people its pretty clear that youre just looking for snarl words to smear people you dont agree with
alas i am unmasked you have me at a loss kind sir your perspicacity is unmatched i stand in awe of a true masterdo not worry you need not bother to follow this thread anymore i shall reform i promise i have seen the light
i for one prefer to give it some time expecting results from the csm from day one is like expecting a newly installed government issueing new laws and such from day one it aint gonna happen because after people get elected they will have to talk with eachother firstand guess what not everyone has the same log in timesnext to that every issue brought forward cant be handled because of two simple reasons1 you need a majority vote from csm members first about the topic 2 there just isnt enough time nor room to cover everything and as such the csm will have to work out which things get work and which will have to wait
this would be far more useful if placed on the official wiki page of each system
still supporting since 2006
this is just common sense stop giving us lots of broken and undeveloped goodies and give us a few solid stable planned out shinies
remember the skill queue ccp it turned out a fantastic idea after all to your own surprise this is just like that fixing all existing broken features might seem like a bad idea at first but it actualy is a fantastic idea trust your playerbase on this one
this has been needed for so long nowsupported
i dont need more to love in eve i need to love it more

just curious but people keep saying that scanning sucks but its the only part that actually works well people must not understand how to do it properly if they think the colors need to be change because limiting your scans width will always result in very high contrast resolutions even on lightly populated resourcesi support the rest just cant figure out the beef with scanning
bump
yes fix what needs to be fixedthe nosneut icon in the overview along with an ewar column would be awesome
fully supported whole load of brilliant ideas right there
add pleasewhen a ship is in the process of being targeted add it as a ghosted out icon on the list of already targeted entities that way we can queue modules to activate on it before its targeted like you can do with your first targetfully support everything else
these minor improvements would add a lot to the enjoyment of eve
i support this idea
not to sunshine on your stormy parade but begging for isk actually works sometimesin fact i once had a player give me 10 mil when i lost my shipand i didnt even ask for it
not supported
notsupportedif the crybabies want to play a sookie game go and play sims and you and your boyfriends can dress each other upccp have not mentioned that they wish to remove them  just the crowd who drive around in the whaaaaaambulancenow get away from our game you sook
remove learning skillsoh really youd be wrong theyve wanted to remove them for years but didnt have a satisfactory means for doing so they do now
it is clear that this is a divisive issue within the player base perhaps i can offer a distinct perspective as a csm who has now had his baptisminlava in icelandthe key thing to understand is that for issues like this what drives ccp decisionmaking is simple customer retentionthat is they are looking for things that will turn more clueless noobs into bitter old vet crackws while at the same time not disgusting the bitter old vet crackws so much they will switch to another drugwhen it comes to creating new crackws learning skills are the worst feature in eve they actively drive noobs away from the game because noobs are all about instant gratification  they want the rush of a new drug  and learning skills delay that the bitter old vet crackws hereinafter bovcws on the other hand are all about getting their regular fix so they dont get sickmuch of the argument against removing learning skills boils down to this when i was a noob i had to  a lot of  to get my crack and the new bs should have to do the same thingwell the bovcws need to get over that and the reason is simple more new crackws  more money for pimpdaddy ccp  more resources put into developing tastier crack at least if csm has anything to say about itnow that said heres my 2 isk about how to implement it kill the learning skills respec all skills by 10 54  10  99 close enough leave the implants as they are refund all accumulated learning skill skillpoints as a sop to the hyperoptimizers give a small bonus to people who actually trained advanced skills to v such as an extra 10 for points spent training above iv on an advanced learning skill if possible provide one extra respec  or at least reset everyones respec cooldown improve the interface for allocating bonus skillpoints  even a allocate bonus points to train this skill to next level rightclick would be enough run the numbers and determine the optimum initial skill settings for noobs based on the skills they have historically trained not including the learning skills of course use these for noobs add a new reward for completing the npe  a small pool of bonus skillpoints bovcws would get this as well during the changeover this is to my mind a crucial element  you give them a big hit of the true eve crack to get them started on the path to bovcwdom i personally would do this instead of doublerate trainingi would like to see more discussion on this issue but i want to go on record as saying that if i dont read any showstoppers i am going to raise this as a csm proposal  and i welcome cosponsors that means you sok
what is a sop also the 10 is important only if they keep remapsi like the extra remap idea too 2 million sp though not alot is enough for some people to use that extra map to polish off some arcane skill set then go back to their old map if they still have their old map
something given to pacify or quiet or as a bribefor example ccp gave the csms an extra trip to iceland as a sop
im gonna send you a crate of beer if you pull this off
well tbh given that i dont drink you are better off promising to send the beer to the devs who do the actual workas a sop of course
lets do it
you deem yourself a representative and then you put out generalized garbage like this you couldnt more clearly be cementing yourself on the antilearning side and have thrown objectivity out the windowa small number of prolearning people hold the above position yes but most support the skills because they add a strategy to the game cry all you want but learning skills at 55 is not normal everyone antilearning says well if you want to play the game then theyre pretty much mandatory thats where most of the problem lies new players are told by all these bitter old vets who are bitter because they also convinced themselves that they had to max learning skills not because of the back in my day syndrome you suggest that the only way to play eve is to train learning skills right away and then of course the anti crowd exaggerates this and says yeah staring at a bar isnt my idea of fun you know why tier 2 learning books are so expensive because they were only ever meant to be attained after a while of playing you know when you could make that kind of money and added in to your training regimen to make all those rank 10 skills go that much easier to reach the net lost time from not doing tier 2 skills for say a month or so is within the realm of a few hours dont believe me i put together a onemonth plan for a minmatar newbie with basic and standard certs mixed and training up to battlecruiser time before learning skills 17 days time after learning skills 12 days time after removing tier 2 learning skills evemon told me to put in 125 daysthats 12 hours differencenow while many people would minmax and say that makes all the difference11 consider the fact that i havent yet done neural remapping to see how i could make it better still nor will most new players have learning skills tier 2 purchasable and why should they nor are they required to sit in a station all day detractors claims to the contrary  takes all of one hour each to put some points into basic skills and then the new players can go do tutorials while their skills level up make enough to buy learning books buy learning books tier 1 go get them add them to the queue and do it strategically  okay i wanna grind my core competency first so ill do intelligence i want to be able to shoot stuff so ill get my perception and will skills up then i can jump right into ship skilling afterwards and yes even i want to make sure i have my learning skills so ill 2 days just letting them level up note how long the learning skills evemon recommended would take alone and then start other stuffwhat the anti crowd always seems to neglect or conveniently forget is that there is a lot of waiting for a new player i know that while to players who have been playing for a while it isnt a long time the day and a half or two days or whatever that frigate iv took when i trained it two months ago seemed to take forever and you know what looking back im 100 okay with that because thats a drop in the bucket compared to the rank 8s that im eying right now the antilearning people arent they simply want to minimize the wait not because of any real concern for the new players or if there is its in a small number of their population but because they just want more fastertrebor while i appreciate you expressing your interest in serving your csm duties i ask that you take a good hard look at this and other threads where debate has arisen and step back from any personal feelings you have consider the arguments coming from my umm colleagues and i think about whether youre serving the majority or just the most vocal side
dunno i think that a 10attrib 10 would be too muchrather a 7 attrib 8 would be better 43 attrib skills and lvl 4 learninga full reimbursement of sp spent on learning skills would be goodheres where it gets more complicateda prorated sp pool is given to all players based on the 78 training model adjusted for cybernetic bonusesin other words the guy who never trained learning skills and has been training other skills will get a huge bonus in sp bringing him up to the level of what a character who trained to 78 would be atthe guy who skill trained all attributes from 7 to 10 and trained learning from 8 to 10 or only gets bonuses to skills trained before that timehe would be reasonably close to what his skillpoints should be anyhow if not morethe current toons who are maxed out with learning skills will slow down some 3attrib 2 post fix but will not lose anything already trainedthe toons who are at 7attrib 8 will stay pretty much eventhe toons who minimally trained learning gets a big catchup boosteveryone gets some free sp except for brand new toons who will never have to slog through learning skillsreward enough imooverall effects base training times speed up for almost everyone new players get to train useful skills outta the box older players who trained learning skills get reimbursed for wasted time older players who minimally trained learning get a big boostreally how many of these are out therei think that overall the idea is great just needs some changes to itsupported
just because im a csm doesnt mean i cant have strong opinions about the game  and yes i think that the learning skills are netnegative for eve however please dont assume that i cant be objective i have been a practicing skeptic for all of my adult life so if you can come up with a decent argument that a position i hold is incorrect i am honorbound to accept your argument and revise my opinionfurthermore dont let my tendency to leaven my arguments with humor give you the impression that i dont take things seriouslywith that in mindi understand and appreciate this position i will go further  i agree that it adds a strategy to the gamethe real question however is this is what learning skills add to the game worth what it costs the gamein particular do learning skills put off noobs who we all want to become hopelessly addicted crackws like ourselves after all misery loves company if so they are a huge negative for the game as a whole i am of the opinion that there is significant evidence that this is the case  and if i am wrong about this then most of the argument for killing learning skills is blown out of the waterthe counterargument is that learning skills are cumulative the earlier you get them boosted yeah you might only save a few hours getting to bc but the deeper you intend to go in the game the more you need themfurthermore even without evemon the reasonably optimal learning skills training plan is pretty obvious the strategy aspect of learning skills is not if but when you will get everything but the charisma skills to viii or vivthe problem with ifwhen decisions is that for a noob they present an opportunity to delay gratification this is very bad the key to noob retention is instant gratification they are noobs baby eve players they want it right now imho the doublerate training was ccps first iteration on addressing this issuei somewhat agree with you however keep in mind you and i are not representative of the typical noob most noobs stop playing we are the atypical noobs who did not stop playing so we have to be careful projecting our own feelings onto the typical noobfinally from a purely tactical standpoint in the csm minigame i get to play whether you believe the statements that ccp wants to get rid of learning skills or not it makes sense to me to present them with a playerdesigned optionif they dont think learning skills affect player retention theyll stick it in the backlog to rotif on the other hand they do want to make a change wouldnt you prefer them to implement something the players have debated one that has some benefits for everyone
i do not support thisin the interests of arguing the point the only fair thing to do if the learning skills and the points they granted are removed is to grant back the players the actual skill points applied to learning skills no additional attribute points no speed to training boosts  just raw skill points much like the downtime gift to be redistributed as the player wishes sure this doesnt provide anything to those who havent trained learning skills or new players  but it levels the field and removes the learning skills but not the time spent on themfor those who are all about the fear that new pilots dont like training learning skills this resolves that issue no learning skills  no delay in training other skillsfor those who did not choose to train learning skills it does nothing for them they did not spend the time or skillpoints or isk therefore they would have no argument for reimbursementfor those who trained learning skills the bonuses they provided are history as attributes would revert to nonlearning skill levels but the actual skillpoints are returned to a general pool so the isk and time spent on those skills maintains some valueall this proposal should do is reduce the advantage provided by learning skills going forwardi still dont support it
well yeah i started back in 2006 after the tutorial i had 100k isk a 1 implant and an atron that was it i didnt have this bull 2x training time up to 16 million sp i never got all this free stuff for starting the game i just got that and a good luck dont die from ccp and fellow playersso i dont see what the real problem is using this 2x training time to in the begining to train learning skills is more than enough compensation instead fo 25 days to train all the basic learnings from lvl 4 to lvl 5 it is now 13 assumption 4 days per level 5 skillnow ccps goal is payer retention right well why not up the 2x training time to 2 million sp or adjust char creation to have more learning skills say all the basics to lvl 2but no removing learnign skills is bad
its mandatory to train them up front because of the accelerated training 54 learning skills can pay for themselves in just three monthsexamplealice and bob are new characters both remap their attributes to perception 12 and intelligence 12 for flying and fitting skills alice uses her accelerated training bonus to train flyingfitting skills immediately bob decides to train the learning skills up firstif bob takes 14 days to train the learning skills to 444 basic to iv advanced to iv and learning to iv he will catch up to alice in less two months meaning that in two months bob will have all the skills that alice has plus 444 in learning skillsif bob takes 42 days to train the learning skills to 545 then in just three months he have all the skills that alice has plus 545 in learning skills if bob had used both remaps he could have gotten the 42 days down to 335 days and then remapped to 1212 in percintthree months for 545 to pay for itself you would have to be crazy not to train the damn learning skills for the first monthits not the learning skills that are the problem its the accelerated training bonus and two free remaps that forcesencourages newbies to front load the learning skills if you really want to torpedo the give everyone 10 attributes proposal then petition to have the learning skills unaffected by the accelerated training bonus and only provide one remap to newbies
i would approve of this changes though it would not necessarily have to be done by a learning speed boost but by the new system they implemented
the strategic aspect of learning skills many prolearners support is already duplicated by the prospect of neural remapping and implants both have tangible risks and rewards in the first the reward is increased training time for certain skills while the risk is slower training time should you train any nonspecd skills  in the second implants give an increase in training time but at a hefty isk cost the only tangible risk for learning skills is of new players deciding they dont want to have to spend the first month of the game training learning skills and not playing particularly when the free trial time lasts for a shorter period than it would actually take to train these skillspoint being there are already other gameplay features in place that players can manipulate to get faster or shorter training times none of which are nearly as frustrating or new playerimpeding as learning skills

just let it go man
thisand threadi support the idea maybe it can be good to limit it to a onetime only to avoid a possible bad usage i dont see where whatever the previous posters said but eve players can be imaginativebut it is absolutely important that the skill points must be calculated according to implants and learning the character had before he left
net present value this is why you cant give them 15 now and get something that you passed on 2 years agoi had a character in 2003 should that character be able to have 100m sp now even though i didnt really start playing until 2 years laterbeyond that what about the days before the training queue people who hit snooze on their alarm clock at 4am that had been set specifically to change skills and thus lost 3 hours of training time repeatedly have a better claim on missing sp if you want to go down that road but even though i am in that boat i dont think this is appropriate eitherif you snooze you lose
like i said before only 1 year worth of sp  game time could be bought back so no 2003 freak could be createdand for the time b4 the training queue  thank god it doesnt exist anymore eve is a futuristic game look to teh futur not the pastnew features like this one and respecing are coming
supportedhell yes imo there should be no readonly feature in evegate that is not fully implemented in the apiim not so convinced on writeaccess via api though
granular keys are a necessity and the player base has been asking for them directly or not since the api came out
api improvments  yesspacebook  no
if write access is available on eve gate it should be available on the api or were back to square one lots of people just scripting eve gatei do think that granular keys or rather permission based keys should be a prerequisite to this however  you want to have total control over what can write
too latethe evegate team was run by someone with zero understanding of social networkingthey decided not to use any open standards while being stuck on ms servers the choices are limited anywaywhen questioned on it at fanfest the team leader went into an ego driven rant about how he knew bettereve api should be oauth instead ofaswell as keysevegate should be an openid provider with oauth extensionevegate should have an opensocial container apache shindig is 50000 hours of free code for users to develop fleetcalendareventorganisation apps9999 of the potential of evegate has been squandered by making it proprietry closed system with no integration points
agreed however with the current tiers of api keys adding write access would be potentially bad currently the full api key does not allow write access so if ccp went and granted write access through the full api key youve potentially got a security disaster there thats why i dont support it right nowwith the addition of a new really full api key that allows full access  write then its all good

actually eve gate should have been based on top of the api so that all functionality of eve gate would also be available for 3rd party developers but yes i agree the api needs a big overhaul and why try to invent the wheel again

good post ix we really need something to happen soonsigned

yes
yes please

at fanfest we were told it would be and so we should expect the api to improve because ccp would be using it themselves
agreed eve gate seems very sparse integration plus better api support will mean this becomes a very important piece of the game right now its a bit of an albatross

the idea behind the rig i mentioned its like a sub system for t3 ships you can make them buy them on the market use them like normal rigs depending on which one depends on what texture your ship is assigned when it loads on your or another players screen if you play with a t3 cruiser in the preview window opened from the info window you can see each subsystem modifys not only the texture placed on the ship but the model used as well so they allready have the coding in place to support this kind of system they just have to add a slot on every ship and add the rigs themselfs but like all rigs this is a perminant modification unless it is destroyed which would keep the market open and alive as far as bidding wars and the 01 isk wars and what not its part of having a open player controled market im sorry but live with it or go play a npc single player game with a complete npc marketok i agree sending a preset number would be easier then just the name of a file and would be possible in my eyes as far as your fleet fights dont  at me over it ccp hasnt gotten off their ass and fixed massive fight lag in almost a year as it is now take into consideration i added a switch to turn this graphical feature off which means it will cut down on server demand and computer graphics demand for these fights much like turning off turrent effects effects missile effects and so on so far my postings are the only one to impliment such an idea with this package
yeah you definitely dont understand how the assembly hall works supports are basically just a straw poll  they dont mean anything theres some cutoff where if you get several thousand then ccp has to look at it but nothing has ever come close so thats a theoretical limit the csm has nine members not 7although some meeting have as few as 7 in attendance so 43 votes do happen and ccp doesnt code things for the purpose of just testing them  if it gets written its because someone expects it to make it to tq csmccp meetings are talking about the issues not the details on where the testing happens
yeah the fact that all shots hit the same spot is awkward
seems pretty critical would love to hear something about this issue
supported with a a
it is funny that all of you people want to make stuff you mine worthless
yes pleasethat would be the more interesting option ofc
not exactly id just rather not see other ships simply duplicated by t3 why not just take a logistics also using the previous example a logistics ship with proteus ehp would be plain better than the specialised t2 hull
logistics have more advantages over t3 ships than just range signature cap transfers cap bonuses fitting bonusest3 currently have a bonus to repair amount which is useless with such limited range
give it more range but it should still be much shorter then a logi ship logistics ships are fragile so they need to be able to sit away from the fight t3 ships have some of the toughest teanks around can have cloacks and interdiction nullifiers so there is no reaosn they should sit 60 km away you can boost their range for 20km but nothing drastic please
i like the uniqueness of bonus to rep amount and i dont want to obsolete logistics cruiserswith that said range does need to be increased a tad 2530km at lvl 5 defensive sub would be okay imo
the only t3 ship with a smaller sig radius would be the loki teh rest would all be larger than their t2 counterparts much much larger in the case of the tengu
im not opposed to any changes just making the point that care should be taken with t3 rolesi think some of the above posts hit the nail on the head a range of around 20km would let them have a bit of mobility but not overshadow logistics also they could let them maintain mobility in little rr groups
giving them a 30 bonus to rep range per level would be resonable imo that would give them a 15km range 132km with subsystem skill  level 4 on best named medium reps and 21km 185km with subsystem skill  level 4 on a best named large rep which sounds pretty decent to me
i completely agree
i dont know about the other t3 but the tengu can easily mount a large shield transporter full rack of launchers resists  bufferjust thought id throw that out there as i think i have now seen 2 people mention them using medium reps throw in the sensor strength subsystem  some eccm mods and you could have a really nasty remote rep circle to break
and get outrepped five fold by a logistics ship
my proposal is to add more systems to eve high sec is fine as it is low sec is quiet and 00 is crowded my proposal is to add more 00 systems to eve expand current 00 systems by x5 or 10 the online user amount has been ten folded in the past 23 years why not the amount of systems this will decrease the amount of stress on the server and will cause less lagg with the recent server move it is possible if ccp is willing to invest in there clientsdiscuss
much of 00 is empty there are 00 station systems which players rarely enter also the online user amount has not been increased tenfold in three years it has maybe quadrupled not tenfoldsystems share a blade with many other systems fleet lag occurs when a lot of pilots are doing stuff all on the same cpus so that cascades across multiple systems you always know something interesting is happening when life gets laggy for no reasonwhat is the purpose of having more 00 systems
the best way to make eve bigger is to make individual systems bigger dominion was a good start but i think more is probably in order adding new regions feels unnecessary to me
i think your problem stems from the fact that you are comparing t2 ammo to faction ammo which usually cost in the region of 10 times as muchcompare the t2 ammo to t1 standard
helloecm by far the most powerful form of electronic warfare is almost universally hated controversal game mechanic the effects of other forms of electronic warfare could be somewhat negated by proper piloting the only way to semireliably protect yourself from ecm is to sacrifice 2 mid slots for eccm lol or to sacrifice low slots for some terribly ineffective sensor backup arrays sensor strengthincreasing implants available from faction warfare lp stores are far too expensive to be viable and prevent you from plugging in some actually useful implant sets  not to mention that a whole set of implants is something you probably dont want to take on a nullsec roam unless you have an abnormally massive genitaliathe main problem with ecm as i see it is that its simply gamebreaking for solo pilots with no way to counter it via maneuvering or smart ship fitting effectively making a fight completely hopeless to elaborate on thissensor dampening can be countered by getting closer or waiting our the longer lock time equipementwise the effects can be diminished by fitting a sensor booster which isnt the most useful module in the world but at least it does something other than protecting you against some specific form of electronic warfaretracking disruption can be countered by minimizing transversal or again by getting closer to your target furthermore tracking enhancers and to the lesser extent tracking computers are great modules and there is a huge number of ships that benefit from fitting them anyway using sooth sayer drop or frentix boosters can also help with thistarget painting is a very specific form of electronic warfare most of the time you dont even need to counter it although using xinstinct boosters can certainly helpconsidering that ccp doesnt like to modify existing game mechanics prefering to add new features instead i propose an introduction of a sensor strengthincreasing combat boosterwhat is a combat booster from relevant eve online wiki article it can work like thissynth 10 sensr str increasestandard 50improved 90strong 130alternatively the booster can modify base sensor strength which will make it useful for small ships like frigates and destroyersthe drawbacks could bea penalty to strength of electronic warfare modulesa penatly to range of electronic warfare modulesa penalty to their capacitor efficiencya penalty to locking rangehow this will change fleethuge gang warfarethis will not change fleethuge gang warfare in any wayhow this will change pve side of the gamethis will not affect pve in any meaningful way considering current booster prices using standard improved or strong boosters for pve simply isnt costeffectivedo we really need more unprobable ships in this gamewe dont but its already p easy to make your t3 cruiser both unprobable and command linklevel 4 missioncapable also popping boosters every 20 minutes to stay unprobable just isnt practical most of the time so this wont change anythinghow this will change solosmall gang pvpdramatically i dont even have to explain
tldrccp doesnt like to mess with existing mechanics so its naive to expect any sort of fix to ecmccp loves introducing new featuresintroduce a sensor strengthincreasing combat boosterpeople who think that ecm somehow makes small gang pvp in any way better remind of that guy who put his house cat in a microwave to dry it up a bitpeople who fly solo or in small gangs will benefit a lot from this everyone else will remain unaffected ecm will still be a strong and ed game mechanic
supporting this
two thumbs up
im not sure that ecm ships need yet another nerf i understand that the mechanic is annoying  and i agree but this is little more than yet another nerf to ships that i dont even fly anymore because theyre so ineffectivenot supportedliang
this is not about nerfing ecmthis is about giving pilots the ability to counter ecm in a similar manner to that which is available to counter the other forms of ewar
hmm have a loot at at8 matches if ecm was such a game breaking  ecm teams would have won everytime but it isnt the casefrom what i have seen  ecm teams have a success rate of 50if you get caught by ecm  then youre not prepared
by prepared i assume you mean by fitting a eccm module that has no use other than defense against ecm sensor stength boosters would simple give you another way to be preparedalso i should note that alliance tourney doesnt exactly equate to most pvp situations for one thing more slots are generally devoted to eccm than is usually practical for most nontourney setups small ships especially do not have slots to spare and thus have zero ways to counter ecm
awesome idea two thumbs up
i like it
i dont care what you think its about what its actually about is nerfing ecm boosting the counters against something or creating more of them is a nerf to it you are suggesting nerfing ecm ships if the mechanic annoys you suggest changing the mechanicliang
liang if you think about how few people actually use combat boosters youll realize this isnt something that would change ecm on the wholeone thing i might change about the suggestion though is the percentage increase suggested it probably needs to be significantly lower
this suggestion is actually pretty good since it doesnt directly nerf ecm ships keeping those ships invaluable in fleet battles not everyone will be using these boosters when theyre fighting since theyll have penalties to other attributes when being used we have drop and xinstinct to counter tracking disruptors and target painters so a sensor strength booster would be pretty coola booster that decreases lock time or increases locking range would be nice to counter sensor damps as wellccp make it happen
calm downthis will not affect you in any way unless you are blobbing some poor guy or a microscopic 24 men gang with ecm
you just got sensor strength implant sets thats not enoughnot supported
since that is never going to happen id still go with what dierdra suggested increase the expansion interval to maybe 9 months and use the gained time to polishfix stuff
supported if theyre going to fix issues the 3d animators wont have much to do the next 6 months couldnt they fix this variation crp visual enhancement may be trivial but its still something worth working on tldr unique hulls for everyone
supportedfix
are they truly so determined to run their flagship in to the groundthats kind of a shame
agreed the odds and ends really need to be tidied up a bit ill throw black ops faction armor platesshield extenders and fw mechanics into the mix as well
these issues are mostly minor i would rather have the cool stuff instead
you forget that incarna was promised five six years ago players were talking about planetary flight when i first started playing four years ago these things were promised from ccp before a lot of the stuff that has come out latelyif i had to guess ccp has been tossing these recent expansions out in the manner they have been released because they are trying to give us something to keep us interested while they try to fulfill their promises of incarna and planetary flight in fact most of these expansions seem to be the groundwork for towards both of those featuresobviously it would be nice if the expansions worked better from the we dont have any devs available to work on those comment from nathan i get the impression that incarna is not ahead of schedule that worries me
i want store fronts though
warning shameless selfpromotion imminenti agree that there has to be some sort of reward for dedicated pibears but the current system only serves to reward poopsockers not critical thinkers what pi needs is something that requires brainsweat like someone above said eve players prefer to think for an hour and click for a minute vs thinking for a min and clicking for an hour personally i think rethinking how the extractor mechanic works would make pi more fun one idea that i threw out might alleviate some of those issues namely the rewarding poopsockers system
excellent listone minor thing to add though make planet textures viewable againi know its minor but it can be important  i cant view planets with their natural textures after getting remote sensing even when im in normal mode i just see black or white blobsnothing game breaking but there have been contests that award plex for screenshots and i dont want to miss out on a 300 mil isk prize simply because i trained a particular skill
would be nice to add a allow queing of the next 30min5hrs23hrs4days mode in extractor  when it is already in the last cycle the one the current mode ends after to the list would allow less downtime  less chances to miss the timeif possible also add the option to feed resource a equally to a group of processors  or to all the processors that use this resource like when we gather 3000 and have 3 processors using it  each would get 1000 would be helpfull in more complexed less clearnumbered situationsanyway is a very good list  would be happy to see at least something implemented
less clicks the amount of isk made in pi is not worth all the clicking
dear ccpim sorry to say it but the cycle times on the extractors are truly epic fail everything needs to be adjusted outwards short cycle  1 daymedium cycle  3 daysstandard cycle  7 daysextended cycle  30 daysthis is clickity click click crap is an annoyance and ads little value in terms of game play its really an annoyance to people who have real lives careers and what not  to have to be obligated to log in every single day to ensure the extractors are running so we can help keep the fuel coming for the corp poss you definitely made the game a job with this move as people who run eve im sure it doesnt bother you too much im sure it doesnt bother the kiddies who are on summer break or even when they are in school but youve completely overlooked the contingent of people who have careers and rl obligations we dont need or want more obligations we want to contribute and this definitely crosses the line in terms of obligation
you made a wrong assumption that you must make your own fuel you dontyou can get it old way like all did just month before and if rl distracts you so much disclaimer i pretty much respect that  but then how you manage to care about poses at all  i think you way overuse that rl argument here
totally in supportim still new so i havent actually used the gang links for shields yetand im glad i read about it first because id be seriously ped to find out in game that the bonus isnt applied right awayas far as the regen bonus is concerned take it i dont care an extra 5 hp per sec versus an instant 1015ill take the big numbers thank youa couple of hours to obtain the same bonus that an armor tanker gets instantly this is a no brainer people
from the perspective of a shield tanker in fw the regen rate increase is insignificant really considering the current primary calling tactics in the warzone ships wo logi support in most cases wont last more than a minute or 2 which makes the extra 1 or 2 hpsec useless whereas the extra 10 shield might allow me to get another weapon cycle off and help my fleet win id prefer it if the regen bonus was kept but dont really care as long as the hp boost is applied immeadiatly to the people asking for a passive armor regen fine but give up your 1600mm plates your base armor resists already more than make up for the gain shield tankers get in fleet ops from passive regen so if you want the bonus of shield regen give up your 1600mm plates which provide twice the buffer as anything us shield tankers can fit shield tankers get passive regen armor tankers get massive buffer tanks
yes please also allow people to configure a list so someone could mail to a mailing list without being able to receive mails to that list
nice features
pop3smtpimap access would be nice too
1good idea
why notnot going to happen as wed start getting spammed and phished from outside
no you wouldnt smtpimap should accept mails and send them only for eve accounts so only spamd start sending only registered eve users this isnt difficult to tune believe meand of course pop3smtp should be available only for paid accountsbtw pop3 will be enough smtpd be nice feature but pop3 is must have imho
terrible idea this would not change the highsec wars  this would eliminate them
terrible idea this would not change the highsec wars  this would eliminate themwhere there is a reason ie not just griefing for kicks and random kms there will still be plenty of wars it will however take commitment from the wardecing corp as opposed to the current all care and no responsibility casual wardec of today heck many smaller corps may still not be able to stump up the counterbid isk so for that scenario its no changeonly people i could see against this would be the casual or semirandom griefer corps who if they are hard corp pvp as they say can still go to lowsec for their easy kill kickshisec will be what imho it should be  generaly quiet except for the occasional larger scale or at least more professionaly run ie commited well funded corporate business by another means still a hostile environment in many ways more so or certainly more expensive to prosper
while i do see a point in increasing costs of highsec wars this is definately not the direction it should be going this idea is horrible makes no sence and would ruin gameplay
ccp has no right to eliminate wars based on what is and what isnt a morally or economically valid warif someones flying a bling mission boat he deserves to be deccedif someone doesnt play eve properly by highsec mining and missioning instead of doing some form of pvp like trading and pewpew he deserves to be deccedif someone has more isk than me and i can get him to spread the wealth he deserves to be deccedof course whether he deserves to be decced or not is irrelevant eve is supposed to be a sandbox mmo and allowing wealthy players or any player to opt out of pvp because theyre more wealthy than their attackers is contrary to that notion
another wonderful example of if you dont play my way you are playing it wrongwith logic like this no wonder the game is half broken
you need to have all implants sets attached to your clone at one timethey still get dstroyed when you remove them and cannot interchange between set racksincreased benefits should come with increased risk i said it before in the other thread and ill say it again hereonly then will you have an idea worth supporting
is anybody else getting a broken link due to the language filter
yeah i am too bizarre i dont know what part of it is getting censored but the link is
excellent description of the problem and good solution proposal herschel supporting that one maxsim maybe you can improve your opening post
this would be very nice im tired of playing the nanoribbon lottery whenever i take out a sleeper site i can come away with a fortune or practically empty handed purely based on the drop rate of one item even normal salvage atleast has a few different high value items among the trash
this is exactly why i am not supporting this idea bottlenecks for t2 is without a doubt stupid but for t3 its great you forget what wormholes are all about its exploration the best part of exploration is plundering the unknown yesterday i was cleaning up 2 c4 sites i did each worth about 66mil in tagsnow i dont usually salvage but today i figured why not and without fail the first 1015 wrecks i salvaged yielded 1 nanoribbon total then i got to one particular sleepless upholder wreck and the damn thing just wouldnt salvage after about 10 minutes of cycles i was about ready to give up when lo and behold salvage complete and 12 nanoribbons filled my cargo that is the great feeling that exploration and the nanoribbon lottery provide yeah sometimes you walk away with nothing but sometimes you strike goldif you want steady guaranteed isk either dont bother to salvage and move on to another site or go back and farm missions
i still fail to see how that makes nanoribbon lottery desirable if you whant to play lottery you might just as well only make one item with low chanse of dropping effect is the same now if ccp added 20 items instead of one i assume they should all have a purpose and not be trash
you claim in your article that alchemy alleviated the bottleneck as was already said in this thread it just moved the bottleneck to technetium a war was waged because of this change the southern alliances taking geminate from wi because tech is worth 3x4x dyspro and prom nowas for t1 salvage i remember when trit bars were millions each this was partially reduced from the nano nerf but it is still the most valuable t1 salvagethen there was zydrine then there was then there was the design of manufacturing in eve will lead to a cascade of bottlenecks the more tinkering done the more out of balance it becomes a true fix would require a reevaluation of drop rates and moon distribution and manufacturing requirements that would be uglyt3 has a better chance as they can add more systems adjust spawn rates adjust loot tables etc all things that arent very obvious
im sure many if not all of you have had experiences with spammers nearly all of them use bots to do this some as simple as repeatedly posting the same messagelink over and over again or more complex ones which post several messages such as the ageoldsend me isk and ill send 10x back which is usually followed byinsert random character link here insert random amount of isk here sentwhile i fully agree with scamming being an integral part of the game using macros should not bei propose that the report isk spammer button be expanded to report anybody using macrosrepeatedly posting the same message too many times so what would happen if enough people report a spammer in local as this to ccp is less important than isk selling the spammers posting history can be run though a program that looks for similarities in each post or any botlike behavior if the results are positive the character gets some kind of warning while it is up prevents the client from doing anything else which includes posting many other popup windows already achieve this such as the petition windowimmediately this stops nearly all macros as unlike the sophisticated macros used in mining or ratting the ones used for spamming are simple and easy to outsmart this is because not nearly as many people spam compared to macro miningif the character or an alt on the same account is reported to be spamming after the warning message the character gets a second warning which does not rely on people reporting it but but the program used before which can monitor the account a while after the first warning if the account continues the account then gets a ban from posting anything in any public channel including local this can be revoked if the character convinces a gm through a petition to do sohow does this help stop spamming using bots1 it stops bots being able to spam indefinitely2 it forces people who use bots to spam constantly to change accounts often as they would probably not be able to prove to gms that they were not using botsi know you can block anyone who spams in local but lets be honest this does not stop them and people should not have to keep on blocking spammers if you can stop people from actually wanting to spam in the first place you are effectively cutting it at the rootshow does this help1 it makes it possible to actually have conversations in trade hubs without having your post disappear under multiple bot posts within seconds before anyone can read it 2 it makes it possible for real people be able to effectively show their wares in local without the same problemswhether you want to accept it or not people using macros to spam in heavily populated systems is a problem it should be fixed soon
one of the problems with ideas like this is that while they work reasonably most of the time they can be abused for the purposes of griefinga potentially better solution is to tarpit local so that the more often a player posts in local the larger the timeout until he can post again the tarpit intensity can be adjusted based on system populationas a rough example with nice round numbers to make it easier to follow the process the actual numbers would be different and adjustablejita has 1000 players in local the maximum tarpit delay is  of players  10 thus 100 secondsthe first time someone posts there is no tarpit delay the post appears immediately the players post count is incremented by 1the player immediately tries to post again the tarpit delay is maxdelay  10 maxpostcount9 his post does not appear until 10 seconds later his post count goes to 2he posts again his post does not appear for 20 seconds his post count goes to 3 and so onevery maxdelay seconds everyones post count is decremented by 1result regular players and honest sellers are not inconvenienced spammers scammers and inconsiderate people who use local for long chats in crowded systems are annoyedthis concept has often been using on mailservers to deal with spam
i like jita spam
i like trebors fix simple yet would have a real benefit
part 1 reduce effective status of overpopulated systemsah jita we hate you imagine if you will concord challenged by a reduced budget and increased sansha incursions announcing that they will no longer provide public security in overpopulated systems when an empire system 05 or above obviously reaches a predefined capacity at our around 150 pilots concord no longer responds to attacks and local empire forces only defend at gates and stations stationgate guns still defend everywhere accessing a gate into an overpopulated system includes the new warning this system is so densely populated that concord does not respond to criminal acts do you wish to proceed the end of the jita market hub forcing players to redistribute the various market forces across new eden the only exception would be the introductory 10 systems where new pilots are spawned these systems would have full concord defense regardless of pilot countpart 2 rebalance of security status of all systemsas part of this redistribution of concord security forces concord will now have random small patrols into lowsecurity space much as the worlds navies now combat the pirate threat of somalia poorly concord will be there maybe if you are headed into lowsec never fear intrepid pirates  concord will always announce that they are patrolling a system in local and only be available in a given losec system for 3060 minutes when entering a losec system where the concord patrol is active a notice appears concord is currently patrolling in this system all acts of aggression will face retaliation continue in addition concord ships in these losec patrols will not be invincible  a well equipped group of locals could conceivably defend their losec home from concord ending the concord defense early obviously with greater security status hit that podding mere capsuleers in addition the quality of the concord patrol increases as the relative security status of systems drop once you leave hisec you may see a small concord squad in 04 but a good sized fleet in 01 obviously 00 space is still not patrolledin addition faction militia pilots have police authority in sovereign losec systems obviously tied into contested and swapped sovereignty when a system is occupied by the opposing militia they become the local police force and in contested systems the current holding militia prior to contested status continues police duties until the contested status is resolved in the event of a pvp event all militia in the local system receive a notice that unsanctioned criminal action has been detected  intervene with a positive response leading to a fleet warp to the combat site
so you just broke virtually every system in highsec and yet managed to somehow make low sec worsecongratulations
010 for trollof the several hundred hisec systems only a handful mission hubs trade hubs and mining farms would be impacted if the impact at 150 is too high set it higher the point is to combat lag in hisec and distribute pilots more throughout space and admittedly to destroy jita as the sole trade hub in the universehow is losec worse all this does is introduce intermittent pve with a more potent opponent than the rats you fall asleep shooting and a new unexpected nature to nonconsensual pvp with the militia police oh wait  you dont like pvp when it comes to you only when you plan it
primarily because hubs provide an ecology all to themselves if you remove the hub you dont just nerf traders miners and mission runners you nerf the whole game pirates flippers salvagers scammers industrialists researchers basically anyone that undocks gets completely screwed over by this change your nerf will do nothing but hurt other professions and create larger regional hubs that fall just under the population requirements because traders will simply operate in a backwater system using remote buysell orders to keep the in system population down all this is is a massive nerf to high sec under the guise of fixing lag when high sec lag is virtually non existent right nowits worse because now all those people with a security status too low to enter high sec are going to randomly get ganked by roving concord patrols without providing an iota of purpose beyond that you do understand that fighting concord isnt pve its death right they dont lose so congratulations on randomly offing every pirate in eve in the mean time there isnt a single pos in high sec anymore because any 0 entity can jump in their 1000 man bs fleet and wipe out every pos in the system without a war dec or worrying about concord attacking their low security members now the market is completely screwed a tier 1frigate costs 150 million isk to buy everyone undocks their credit cards from the game and ccp goes  uponce again congrats
there is no part of this proposal thats a good idea
haha oh wow
 thisalso op as to your fluff densely populated areas tend to have higher authority presence then lower population zones for obvious reasons
this idea wont remove lag at all it will just give another reason for griefers to do their deeds in highsec you said it yourself no more concord except in certain places lolfor low sec pirates already have low security status they dont give a crap if they shoot anyone anymore especially if they are 100 lolnot supported at allif you want to fix the lag problem and remove people in jita attack at the core jita is a trading hub isk is involved well attack with isk high tax rate for transactions that happens in jita less profit in the end so they will go away this is just a theory though
lol  the griefer gets griefed and has a whine its game mechanics boyo suck it up and htfusad panda is sad for you
im in support of this only on the condition that it is legal war targets onlyi agree that suicide gankers while operating perfectly within intended game mechanics should not get rights to the lootso ill hold off checking the box thingy until the op gets edited to say legal war targets only
not supported even if a two day alt is flagged to you it still means zero risk to the person flying the alt as losing that alt just means he has to try again or perhaps two two day alts around next time
this change would make a lot of sense think about it in real life when an aggressor kills someone all the victims properties now legally belong to the aggressor it is actually the polices job to defend and make sure that the aggressor can now pick up what now legally belongs to him
this also marlona sky for king of badgers
umm whatin real life when an aggressor kills someone they go to jailunless youre talking about selfdefense or something in which all the victims property belongs to the family of the deceased
makes sense in regard to wardecs which are not criminalbut would add corp members of the victim as players not flagged for looting to prevent a good idea for wardecs to be abused in other situations
proposed skill skillbook preinjectiondescription each level of this skill allows you to inject 1 skillbook that the character does not have the prerequisite skills fora preinjected skill can be placed in the training queue but only if the prerequisite skill levels are queued before itonce the prerequisite skills are trained the character gets the preinjection slot backskill catagory learningprerequisite none or learning 2 or learning 3primary attribute memorysecondary attribute intelligencetraining time multiplier 1xstructurevolume 001m3the upshot of this skill is to be able to inject planned skillbooks ahead of timegame mechanics must be in place to prevent a preinjected skill to be trained before the prerequisite skills howeveri feel this skill would be a good complement to the current skill queue systemit would allow a player to train advanced skills seamlessly so you dont lose training time if you cannot log in during an off hourexamplecharacter has science iii queued preinjects cybernetics and can then queue cybernetics i and iiif the character then removes science iii from the training queue then cybernetics i and ii are also automatically removedif the character tries to place cybernetics i into the queue alone it will not be allowed a message will pop up stating that prerequisite skills must be queued before you can queue this skillonce science iii is trained the character can then preinject another skill up to the characters maximum preinjection limitpreinjected skills should be tagged as such in the character skill sheet and training queue sheet
worst of both worlds imo if theyre going to allow preinjection it shouldnt be artificially limited
this tbhid prefer a system which allowed me to preinject any skill i own but prevent me from learning it unless i have the prerequisites trained this would at least allow me to queue up skills that will be valid once the current skill completes ie training ham to 5 inject ham specialisation and add it to the queue as long as there is 24 hours remaining on the current skill ofc
that make a post and i will support it liang
seems like supercapitals are a dime a dozen these days mostly because right now the only barrier to constructing them is isk which isnt a barrier at all to large alliances id like to see ccp limit the number of new supercapitals that can be built by adding a new mineral used only for supercap production and refined from a new ore this ore would be very rare say a few singlebelt spawns per region in terms of numbers though distributed across all of 00 at random but unlike current ores it could spawn in any 00 system regardless of region or truesec it could only be mined with t2 modulated deep core strip miners no ninjamining this stuff in a burst make each spawn yield at least a few iteron vs full of ore so that it requires some planning or teamwork to carry it home with this new ore and mineral ccp can set the refinery yield and supercap mineral requirements to put a hard limit on the maximum rate at which new supercaps can be built ideally this limit would be significantly lower than the current supercap death rate and would hopefully remain a bit lower than the eventual death rate once everyone starts being much more careful about flinging around their supercaps willynilly benefits keeps eve from becoming supercapitals online adds a new limited resource that can be exploited by anyone willing to brave a bit of 00 exploration and mining unlike moon minerals it doesnt require significant investment or alliancelevel logistics to obtain spawning in any 00 system gives people a reason to explore the many currently empty areas of 00 space makes supercapital kills mean something again instead of just being oh well we lost a titan good thing we have six more coming out this month lots of opportunities for market shenanigans as the big alliances scramble to collect the mineral for their own construction or just to keep it out of their enemies hands
i mine the orei sell the orethe supercap builder buys the orethe supercap pilot only pays isk to supercap builderyou only make the supercap more expencive
because goons already have enough supercaps
just invent death stars  so we have something even bigger to buildmoon sized space ships that can fit 8 racial doomdays200 per level reduction in doomsday recharge time
not nearly as many as other alliancesbut the underlying problem you and maxsim make are valid  this would either succeed and deter new aspiring powers from catching up so easily to the established giants and their supercap armadas or it would fail miserably because the new ore would be farmed in 00 moved to jita and just added to the shopping list of minerals needed to build a titana retweaking of supercap capabilities combined with fixing the servers to more reliably allow fights on the scale where supercaps die in action rather than whilst staring at blank screens would be a more welcome change
csm item lists do include prioritization of the issues they also include a lot of facetoface discussion for the purpose of making sure that ccp knows what it is we want why we want it and how much were willing to give up in order to get it as for allocating csm issues dev time this has already been brought up and disposed of by csm4 csm4 asked for a dev time budget in order to ensure that they werent shuffled off to the side ccp said that nobody else anywhere in the company got that and proposed stakeholder status instead its probably for the best anyways  i dont want a good expansionsized csmraised issue to get ignored just because they only have a third of an expansion left in their dev budget for this year and i dont want devs working on trivial bull the csm raised instead of fixing other more important stuff just because the csm agenda was light last time a dev budget is too far outside ccp processes and too inflexible to be the right solution as long as ccp takes them seriously stakeholder status is the right call part of the fun of csm5 will be to see if that actually happens or not youre trying to rebuild a system thats already in place and youre doing it in complete ignorance of how its set up at present thats a recipe for disaster
your points are valid until you actually read what the chairwoman of the csm wroteduring the course of discussions on various topics csm was consistently told that ccp cannot guarantee putting any resources on our current or future backlogged changes this was a huge wtf moment for me as in wtf does csmasstakeholder mean if we cant influence priority any more than thatthat is 1 yearand but because development resources are already committed to other work for the duration of our term csm5 may accomplish little in the way of measurable metrics i believe our real charter is to pave the way for csm6i do not understand what they can accomplish if everything is already spoken for in development make all the damn lists you wantif they never get done the only ones to suffer are us and the csm folks who bring these ideas forwardso please explain to me how i do not understand the process if the chairwoman of the csm 5 tells us thistldrif they know what we want and still never do anything why make a damn list of issues
you ever done me research in highsec you seem like the type who would look at the lines see that theres a two month waiting period and come back in two months looking for all the free lines it doesnt work that way if ccp schedules major expansions a year or two in advance you need to be there a year or two in advance too lobbying for what you want to see its not fast and its not glamorous but its how stuff has to work one csm meeting is not going to make ccp scrap incarna or even push it back very far and like it or not thats the biggest thing on ccps plate right now anything we want to get needs to either fit in beside it in the expansion schedulereasonable for small stuff or be slotted after it so yeah csm 5 asking for the moon wont get them much more than a moon pie even if ccp bends over backwards for us its what comes later thats the problem for what its worth i dont want to defend ccp too much here if they were serious about doing csm stuff csm1 issues would be coming online pretty frequently these days and theyre not even stuff like sorting inventory by meta which i think csm2 raised and was told itd be a trivial thing to add still isnt in game ccp is hardly blameless in this but theyre too big a company to turn on a dime and on anything but a few coffeebreaksized issues i wouldnt want them to try this stakeholder thing might be a genuine change on their part or it might be a filthy lie designed to keep us off their backs frankly theres no great way to tell for a year or so short of a dev getting plastered and saying that vuk made one homoerotic joke too many and now they arent listening to us any more but whether the news is good or bad your request wont do squat
of course they have their schedules and maybe they even make them one year or more in advancebut that still does not keep them from appointing a release a change is schedule forif they have a roadmap for the next 2 expansions that means 1 year of fixed schedulesbut this would also mean they can add it to the expansion after that but they just dont do thatthey rather keep telling people a fix will come some day either knowing this day will come in 2 years or notjust look at the rocket fix its hilariousi support the idea to give the players some kind of prediction when a accepted change will be released
i oppose this i will never forget the hilarity of being in a fleet going through some amarr lowsec and hearing the fc try to pronounce some of the names
just asking why the skill hydromagnetic physics which costs around 10 million isk is required to train the ice processing skill which only costs around 350000 isk and hydromagnetic physics is a skill required for research of shield systems no other refining skill is this complex is this a mistake should it be physics lvl 4 not hydromagnetic physicscan this requirement for hydromagnetic physics be removedjust wondering thanks

graphical tweaks always get a thumbs from me
this is something ive been thinking would be an excellent addition for a whileit doesnt really give an unbalanced tactical advantage it just removes an annoyance in the gameid suggest it be called infomorph synchronisation and be a rank 5 skill requiring infomorph psychology 4 and biology 4 as prerequisiteseach level of infomorph synchronisation would reduce the jump clone availability timeout by 3 hours per level this means it would be 12 hours at level 4 few would bother training to 5 to gain the 15 hour benefit
yesss eve is to big we need more jump clones available so we can move around more easlywe need bigger blobs 
what i once had as idea and might propose here if enough like the ideamake jc distance dependant light years easiest probably so op here wouldnt have any advantage since he wasnts to jump to other side of map but the idea is if you just want to get to other clone for the implantsmoving a little bit you have a short timer lets say 12 hours if you want to travel to other side of universe you get a timer of a few days would make blobs harder since you cant just jc all the time accross half the universe would make pvp for carebears more attractive since they can get to implantless clone easier
ccp like most growing software companies always has far more potential ideas than resources currently incarna  dust  the lag issue greatly exacerbate the shortage of development resourcesit would be very problematic to let the csm or other stakeholders add features to the mix but i think the csm could provide some real value to helping keep things focused say any nonsecurityaccounting feature that is going to take more than x personweeks of effort gets run by the csm in advance it is so much more efficient to never beginpause things early rather than work on them and pull them from a late scrum naturally ccp veto would not be binding but a recommendation to not try to add a feature in the next release could add some valuethis buys ccp some cover with the player basethis provides a calmer outside voice free from ccp internal development historypoliticsturmoilit is consistent with what a lot of people said about wanting excellentcomplete features  tanstaafl so that means fewer things need to be attempted if they are to be done better
supported would give the playerbase more time to help ccp come up with new ideas for the content if we know what the next expansion will offer

i agree that it would be powerful but i see no reason to believe that it would be good game design

ive got an alt trained to 4 or 5 in all the pi skills and do not see this issuemuch as i hate to consign you to the hell of bug reporting i would suggest you do a fullreinstall of the client and bugreport it if this doesnt fix the problem

instead of a petition go here
speaking of which i read in the summit minutes something about extending the term from 6 months to a full yeardid ccp approve that at all or was that just another discussion that they put on the backlog
its already in place csm5 is serving a 10month termthey wanted to change when in the year the elections fell and then csm6 will be 12month terms
and it was ccps idea not ours
and it was done so that csm summits could be conducted at the start of each sixmonth development cycle the intention being that csm priorities could be taken into timely consideration for each cycle although this was decided during csm4s term and although the first csm5 summit did indeed occur at the start of a dev cycle we got no commitments from ccp for putting any csm backlogged items in the winter expansion the only distant possibility i recall is a we will investigate the feasibility to put this in to the winter expansion response to a csm4 item t3 refitting subsystems at pos  carrier that csm5 carried forward we otherwise have no idea what if any csm backlogged items are being considered for inclusion on the winter expansion or interim patches for that matter nor is there any easy way to get a list of csm items in the backlog or their status because those items are not tagged with a csm identifier at the summit we requested such a list and the implementation of a process for tagging csm items going forward ccp committed to doing thisby the next summit six months from now i find that timeframe somewhat ridiculous tbh how hard exactly could this job be and ummmgee maybe it would be easier and faster if the csm were employed somehow to aid in the process butno dice im tracking the status of that and other deliverables on my blog though will cheerfully give credit where due when ccp delivers and in the meanwhile will post updates for each followup to check the status of these ccp commitments
increased success by lowering the expectations
i can sum it up in 2 sentencesbest csm yet worst ccp everwere investing a lot of hope in you guys dont let us down

1 seriously how long does it take to fix rockets
1o uni
what is the op asking in money terms and who will pay for it i dont work in the software industry so have pulled these figures from my ass please feel free to correct me if you know betterthe backlog of things that are broken in eve is quite big and the talent needed to fix it is going to be diverse the current ccp devs are working on dust and incarna so its not going to be as simple as pulling staff off those projects to work on fixing eve the money and marketing folk would have a nervous breakdownto achieve excellence as defined in the op would require ccp to hire more staff and im going to guess the average cost of employing a developer is about 150000 euros per year including overheads assuming a team of ten people are required to fix eve thats a 15 million euro bill thats going to drop through ccps letterboxif that bill was passed on to subscribers youd be talking about adding 5 euros to each of the 300000 subscriptions and i cant see anyone being happy about that it would certainly make me think about canceling one or two of my accounts alternatively ccp could pull people off dust and incarna lol or they could suck up the costs themselves which isnt something companies like to doso i return to my original question who do you think should pay for this

i have all learning skills fully trained and would be totally satisfied with this solution
learnings strategic wtf is strategic about not leaving the station for 2 months
100  correct everyone has a choice
i have been playing for over four years now when i first started the learning skill were already in the game as history has presented the number of players and subscriptions has risen as the game became more popular yet for some unknown reason the new players today just can not cope with the learning skills and want them removed with the stipulation that the bonuses offered from the skills are freely granted how did this game survive much less expand when these same daunting skills have been in the game for so long inflicting their ills upon the player baseccp has gotten softer over the years in my opinion before the probing changes exploration was a dedicated profession with high risks and potentially grand rewards the probes were broken into specific areas of expertise with distinct sets of continuously smaller range but stronger signal probes required to lock down a target the probes were like ammo  once launched the probes were consumed ccp changed the whole profession into a simpler task to allow everyone to go exploring all the probes were converted into a singular type that was also a reusable probe those that had blueprints researched for the older style of probes were told tough luck  no compensation those luckless players were not greater than the new majority pushed into finding wormholesother skills over the years had their requirements lowered to allow more people to gain those skills faster including the first tier learning skills the skill queue was a debated topic for a while before ccp implemented that program the proqueue players rallied that it was unfair that extended or unannounced downtime took away from them changing skills so many years later ccp has an extended downtime and gives away skill points going soft againwith the release of dominion the lag in null security space went off the charts while i do not have actually numbers i would harbor a good guess that a majority of players in those regions of space are older veterans and i would guess that their overall numbers are less than those that hang out in empire space author included  another expansion was released with the intent that brand new players can start messing up planets the lag continued and again in my opinion ccp not worried about the older veterans since they been with the game for quite some time  were not liable to throw it all away but has anyone looked into the character bazaar forum lately and noticed a good number of null sec pilots offered for saleccp is expanding to create dust 514 for the console which is usually stereotyped as the younger crowd with the twitch reflexes console shelf life is measured in months not years long ago ccp stated to have a ten year plan for eve and with the eighth alliance tournament behind us you can do the mathso will ccp remove the learning skills and grant new players everything on a silver platter to gain those subscription numbers and profits of course they will since we crusty old veterans are probably more a hindrance while weve already profited them greatly instead of ccp worrying about how to entice the veterans with new goals to parallel our expanded skill point totals ccp can sit back and the new players work their way up to where we are today by then the ten year plan will be completed and ccp can then concentrate upon their new release  probably the world of darkness game with white wolf as backing materials and since ccp gained the goodwill of all the new players granted life on a silver platter their new game will have a solid starting baseand we crusty old bitter veterans  our total numbers would not dent the bottom line if we played or notmy humble opinion of course  guttripper
the game has had an atrocious ui all those years as well i guess we should leave that unchanged also since subscriptions still grew during that period what youve said in your post is true but its hardly a good way to argue to keep an old system in place any decision ccp makes will likely be based on their estimates of how many potential players are sufficiently put off by the learning skill system that they dont subscribe vs the number of players that would quit if it was removed
oh i agree the interface needs work but based upon ankhesentapemkahs blog ccp has supposedly statedunfortunately nathan ccps producer became very defensive and attempted to justify ccps development process he also said that ccp cannot commit to big issues right now as a lot of their developers are tied down building incarna and dustskipthe csm met with the team responsible for the user interface during this afternoon the csm stated that the ui is the first impression players get of eve and that many players are overwhelmed by it or annoyed by the poor usability overhauling the ui would help retaining a lot of the new players so the csm claimed disappointingly enough ccp does not want to commit to a ui overhaul the csm proceeded to list smaller problems in the current ui which were noted by the dev teamskipunfortunately the csm heard time and again that ccp simply does not have any resources to commit to anything this frustrated the csm which said that some of the issues have been brought up by every csm to date corp roles review alliances in fw and were not closer to being addressed than they were two years ago ccp developers said that many of their own issues have not made it ingame either and called the csm to be realistic the csm openly questioned their purpose at this point as they said there was little point in raising player issues if they were never going to get addressed no matter how small they were or how highly they prioritized them as ccp would just run off doing its own thingso takseen as much as you and i can debate points back and forth even though you are cough gallente cough  until ccp has a commitment to address players points it does seem they will have their own agenda to follow and that agenda seems to be to snag the potentially new players gained from dust and incarna i doubt these two new platforms of players are going to worry whether the learning skills remain or not since i would think dust will be like any other shooter no stats and incarna will not be affected by attributes according to ccpso ummm been watching the world cup germany looks pretty strong this year
if everyone is so worried about new players just skilling up in learning and not playing the gamewhy not just put a skill prerequisite for any learning skillssomething like 5million skill points required to do any of themproblem solved they play the game its a bonus to get after you are commited to a game as extra skillsi do not support the original change i like learning skills  its part of the sandbox do them or do not do them
supported lets have newbies play for their first few months instead of just playing counterstrike for a month as soundwave said at fanfest p
not supported noone needs to train the learning skills to 55 right off the bat it is their choice to be bored when i started i balanced learning skills with the training of my normal skills as well i had fun and did not care that i lost a couple of hours here and there to not having the leet learning skills right from the start instead i was killing things and mining rockscurrently i have them at 44 and guess what i have some plans in evemon right now that show almost no gain in training them to level v even with a year of training planned in advance so the complainers must be the ones that thought it would be good to train them to level v to save a couple minutes of training out of a year and now want their sp back for their bad decisionwhat really needs to happen is new players should be taught to balance their training rather than sitting in the station training things to level v the game is what you make of it if you want to sit in station and spin out of boredom you will if you want to have fun you will learning skills do not change that
im not going to read through this rather lengthy thread so my apology in advance if this was covered alreadypersonally i support the removal of the learning skills i wouldnt be surprised in fact if the method ccp used recently to reimburse us for the extended downtime was a program created specifically to do away with them although thats just hopeful theory crafting better that than they just making them go poof sorry guys personally i say give those who trained the learning skills the sp theyve invested in that category to do with as they please just as they did with the gifted sp recently from there on base the attributes off of whatever that player has their attributes mapped to whether everyone gets the points youd gained from having all the learning skills at 5 or those points disappear entirely is completely irrelevant imo and i really dont see the point of arguing it either way every one is equal across the board your attributes and how fast you learn are then solely based on how they are mapped as well as the implants you have injectedthe older players complain its not fair that they invested all that time in learning those skills that its another good level of separation between players or whatever your argument may be at first that may sound all well and good and a solid argumentbut nit and grit is that its total bs and nothing but pure tears youve played for so many odd years youve stuck with it through hundreds of other changes youre still here even with the game crushing lag i too have trained those skills i too have seen the benefits of doing so and i too have seen the complete and utter uselessness of having to sit for those some odd days training skills that nearly everyone even ccp agree was a horrible ideathe thing many of you seem to forget is that ccp is a company and as a company like the ones you all work for or own theyre in the business to make money to turn a profit and to continue to grow and develop if a market test was done to see if the learning skills had any effect on new players sticking with the game and discovered it did then you can bet your butt theyre going to do away with them whether you like it or not because frankly money speaks louder than you if thats a problem with youwell htfu personally anything that helps to increase the interest and popularity of eve is imo a good thingfrankly though i dont see the problem with this idea you get your sp and in essence your time back that you spent training them youre also still ahead of the newer players and will continue to be so because wed all be on a level playing field in terms of training time if a newer player passes you in gunnery because your attributes are mapped elsewhere and that bothers you well then thats your own fault because you mapped your attributes the way you did
a couple of minutes try two months knocked off the first year or 16 months of training in the first yearassuming that i havent borked the math a newbie who burns a remap can pay off the 555 skills in up to eight months not counting implants according to evemon it takes 113 days 38 months to train to 555 with 555 skills youll have a 194 learning rate not considering implants which means that for the last four months of the year youll get in nearly eight months of trainingthe mathmax base rate 15  52  195 skill points per minute this is the max rate you can train with no learning skillsaccording to evemon it takes 113 days 38 months to get to 555 remap  16m training speed bonus555 rate 1510  9102   11  3795 skill pointsmin3795  195  1946 the 555 rate produces 1946 of the skill points per time unit versus the max base ratehow long will it take for the 555 rate to catch up to the max base ratea 1946x  113  10x  10  1131946x  113 this is the 555 side of the equation x is days 1946 is the training rate 113 is because we spent 113 days training 55510x  10  113 this is the no learning skills side x is days we have a 113 day head start training at 10 base rateb 1946x  x  226c 946x  226d x  226  946e x  2389 days so about eight months for 555 to pay off in the worst case not considering implantsif youre outside of the accelerated training bonus youre looking at 130 days to get to 555 with a remap payoff is in 260  946  2748 days or a little over 9 months worst case and no implantsedit yes im aware that going from iv to v can result in a years long payback diminishing returns and nonlinear curve the point is that even if you spend 38 months getting to v youll still see a relatively quick payback lies damn lies and statistics 
supported partially because i dont believe training skills add much in the way of strategy or depth to the game but mainly because im looking after number one 2 million sp to spend and more noobs to kill sounds like win win to me

its nice to have beleifs but that doesnt make them trueit would be nice if a csm would take a lil time to read all what was proposed and post instead of
poje you seem to be missing something here ccp is a company like all companys they are out to earn a profit now dont you think in the 7 years the game has been around this idea has come up before if your idea were to be implemented people would go to the character bizzar buy a old toon with low sp and then buy the missing sp and before you even think it dont tell me well you can only do it if your toon has always been yours etc so on you would be asking for to much procedure and rulesyouve already stated stupid rules like if you missed 2 years you can only buy back 1 year wheres your logic give me an exmaple in game now where when you snooze and lose you can buy back what you missed but only half of itif eve is dying and ccp needs cah bad expect to see your idea implemented otherwise its not happining and honstly you can ask why all you want if you missed time on eve learn to deal with it or find a new gamethread
another one that didnt read properlylet me rewrite the possible rules that could be implemented   it can be done only once per account to help those who realy need it that way it cant be farmed you can buy back up to 1 year worth of game time maximum so an old character woudnt be a possible monster the number of sp available is based on the average sp per month the character chosen has trained if an old toon just played 2 months the average sp he did in those 2 first months are quite low so even if he decide to buy a year back it wont mean alot of spand i could add a new rule  the process cant be done on a transfered character characters have to be created from scratch in the account to be eligiblewith all these rules and ccp could add even more it will target those who realy need it and with the features already available in eve this is just another one in the same leagueresumUFFFD  whats the difference between paying now or paying the same later  ps  to those that post after this if you dont support this idea be sure to read everything that was said before posting thx

honestly you have a point them being weak but here is by far the largest counterpoint to all of this how long does it take to get into tech two rockets vs how long it takes to get into tech two blasters or autocannons using a minni pilot i get into tech two autos in 5 days 19 hours from day one same pilot so not even caldari 5 days 16 hours so to me seems like there is a reason that an autocannon is more powerful

signwhat was wrong with a smiley face and two squirt gunscomeon ccp get it together
i propose that the blueprints should be seeded on the market or bpcs and the ship itself be placed on ores lp store if this is not possible at least have its model repurposed to be a dedicated salvage ship which is something players have been asking forcorrect choice is boldedi do applauded op for being a useful poster
ideas about how to refine the ship have ended up here and here people have ideas all over the place about it
something has got to be done right now there is the dramiel and then there is everything else as far as frigs gowhy fly any other frigate when a dramiel can do everything betteri propose the dramiel be balancedlower the power grid my 20
usually topics like this get more support when theres an actual proposal involved some sort of evidence that youve put thought into the idea and how itll affect eve a good start would be exactly what about the dramiel you think is overpowered and specifically how to fix it
fair enough ill edit my op then
there are many things that can be used to counter the dramiel get an imagination ffs
supported other frigates need to be viable right now its either dramiel or gtfospecifically lowering the powergrid is a good idea since it wouldnt take away what makes dramiels special their speed and agility though they should be made reasonable too but it would mean that they couldnt fit a medium shield extender and use dual propulsion at the same timetheir tank should be their speed not their hitpoints
so people kill dramiels solo in frigates cruisers bellicose lol battlecruisers even with blasters battleships doesnt look that overpowered for me maybe you should get creative and think about how you can beat them instead of trying to nerf them
the dram isnt that hard to counter tbh sure its good but its also quite expensive its greatest ability is getting out of a fight thats not going well my only concern was that it was a little too fast  overloaded  with snakes it can past 10kmsec which as i understand it was a problem a while back hence the speed nerfperhaps just lower its base speed by 5
your just jellin cuz u dont have 80 mil for a dram
like a badgerseriously though a curse is the end of a dramiel ive escaped dramiels with neuts on various ships it really isnt that hard they usually dont have much cap to sparethere are other ships with crazy speed besides the dramiel the daredevil 4 low slots is one the firetail is another the succubus is slower but it does more damage and can fit two neuts up top to shut down faster frigates
dont forget cruors comets both can even kill dramiels if piloted correctly
a couple of thoughts yes the dramiel can be countered and killed that doesnt change the balance issue with the dramiel given a dramiel w a vanilla fit dramiel dramiel  vanilladamage control iimicro auxiliary power core igyrostabilizer ii1mn afterburner iimedium fs9 regolith shield inductionfaint epsilon warp scrambler icatalyzed coldgas i arcjet thrusters125mm gatling autocannon ii barrage ssmall unstable power fluctuator i125mm gatling autocannon ii barrage ssmall auxiliary thrusters ismall auxiliary thrusters ismall core defence field extender ihobgoblin ii x3hobgoblin ii x11 its a faction frigate that is faster and more agile than an interceptor even nonfaction fit a typical dramiel will go just under 1900 ms w ab and 5400 ms w a mwd alone this is not a problem coupled with the folowing benefits is where the dramiel becomes overpowered 2 its a faction frigate that is not gimped on dps while i dont have eft in front of me this fit can do over 150 dps w rf emp there are several assault frigates that cant put this much dps out 3 it is not gimped on tank this frigate has over 6000 ehp as it can fit a mse and a dcu with faction fittings everything is improved you can fit bigger guns similar tank and go much faster ships are typically balanced amoung these three attributes and the dramiel is just good or amazing at all of them to balance it one of these things needs to be hindered a bit lowering the power grid so it cant fit dual prop and a mse seems a reasonable change in my opinioneditbefore i support such an idea i would want to see some thought as to how much is reasonable etc also if other ships are getting a boost t3 frigates ab boost to af etc then the dramiel might be perfect as is
ffs i dont think people seem to get the point of a faction frigate its a powerful frigate hull that comes with a pretty pricey tag 80 mil iskif anything they should boost the other faction frigs so they can counter the dramiel better that would make the game a lot funner instead of just nerfing everything
dramiel doesnt need to be nerfed gtfo with your nonsensealso go ahead and drop the pg by 15 ill just downgrade to best named stuff and a navy mapc and fly it just as i always have
i like the idea will probably need work as far as required skills go but thats the wunnerful thing about this game infinite room for skill expansionsupported
i was very happy when i read the ship description and it stated that it was a salvage vessel i was very disappointed when i found it was mostly just hangar decoration i figure leave it at its current mass battlecruiser i thinkand propulsion give it a cargo bay somewhere between 5001000m3 3 rigging points and a 434 slot layout with no weapon hardpoints put a role bonus for tractor beams maybe 50 range and velocity so it doesnt compete too directly with marauders or the orca give an on skill bonus for cap capacity or reduced salvage cycle duration or salvage chance a max range of 45km or so with a weak scan res would keep it being used in its intended role without some extremes of creativity and of course keep it unrestricted as far as mission gates are concerned it wouldnt necessarily be better than using a destroyer for the same purpose but it would make it not useless
obviously just saying that this subsystem would make t3 pretty sweet for rr gangs being able to provide good rep at a reasonable range 2025km decent damage with hm point and have all the advantages of being a cruiser agile smallyou seem to be of the opinion that t3 logistics fits should be mirror images of logistics cruisers i see them as cruiser sized rr battleshipsshrugi agree they need a boost to range just not more than 30km at lvl 5 defensive sub skill
actually i completely agree with you but i think medium reps should get the range of around 25km if someone shoehorns in a large they will get a longer range with the missile setup you already stated
i completly agress that a 2530k ish range on med reps on a t3 would make the logistics module worthwhilewhen they did the economic report it showed only one or two modules of each sub are really in demand this is because only one or two are practically useful the logistics module lacks range the overheating module relies on someone using overheat a last ditch technique as standard policyyes dont let a t3 equal a logistics full range but let it get half as far at least
ccp has not given enough information for why it removed ankh from csm all it said she did was violate the nondisclosure agreementdid she reveal things that were said in iceland if so was it for publishing her own minutes for the players she represents if so explain how her minutes violate the nondisclosure agreement but other csm members minutes dontim no fan of ankhs in fact i think she does not understand core game principles but ccp needs to give its paying customers more information on why one of the members they elected were removed from csmobviously revealing what she disclosed that violated the nondisclosure agreement would eliminate the point of the nondisclosure agreement but ccp could at least say whether she violated the nda in her blog or give us a few hints about what exactly violated the nda for example a lot of people have speculated that its because ankh said that ccp is spending most of its resorces on walking in stations and dust by keeping quiet about why ankh was removed ccp is feeding this rumor and making it seem more plausiblesaying were removing her from csm because she revealed a secret so we cant tell you what secret it is so youll just have to trust us hasnt floated well with ccps paying customers
we werent told much either but i doubt that raising it as proposal will gain you much
she spoke ccp stuff is spread thin for incarnadust and have no time to deal with current evei am sure that make them angry
i know but posting it in assembly hall allows csm to bring it up to ccp so ccp could theoretically address itthat was smart of them its not like ccps gonna see a backlash or anything
ccp was very vague with the whole thing but i think this may answer a few of the questions
not really if youre implying the ankh was kicked for publicly criticizing ccp then mynxee would have been kicked also in any case the overall tone of that article was reasonably positive hardly a hate piecebesides if ccp started punishing people for criticizing them then eve would only have about 43 subscribers left
if ccp choses to keep this private they have every right to do so tbh
it might be tricky to provide more details on a breach of a non disclosure agreement without drawing more attention to the information that was supposed to be nondisclosed in the first placejust sayin
its tough to disclose information on a breach of an nda since in disclosing that information you have to break the nda again and make the problem worse ive seen this happen when betatesting other games where the company had to kick betatesters for breaching the nda but couldnt release any information about what was disclosed but at the same time its also the perfect thing to get rid of someone you dont like for the exact reason that you cant disclose much information im more inclined to go with the former reason in this case because everyone criticizes ccp
she revealed information that is critical of ccp so while she technically disclosed information that violated the nda its likely that the reason they booted her was because she told everyone that they were focusing on dust and walking in stationsother csms disclosed information about future development too in their minutes of the meeting in iceland but they werent kicked because they were careful enough to exclude specifics critical of ccp
by that logic theyd have to kickban half of csm
what part of this did you not understandnda being broken implies some stuff was leaked why would ccp open the faucet even more
the stuff leaked was not related to the csm
indeed also the punishment really isnt that significant she wasnt banned and she wasnt sued so
so will there be an election to find her replacementi think it is only fair though i expect ccp will deny us it
first alternate will take his place that is the person with most votes that didnt make it inthe breach was probably a ridiculously insignificant one that was used to get rid of a nonyes man no one left to pressure ccp with force sufficient to make meaningful change  more lag more useless fluff coming our way might have had some odd notions to say the least and a bit on the vocal side but sometimes screaming is the only way to break down barriers kids know this all too well nasty little buggers 
tbh posting issue threads about stuff that really isnt an issue should be a forum banable offense
who cares as long as she is gone oviva nondisclosure agreementsedit we should probably hold the party here

yes sir in fact you are missing something
more counters for a ship class that is hardly worth flying anymore is a bad idea sorryyeah like 100 lowerliang
not supportedof course you realize that the ecm ship engaging you has usually dedicated his entire fit to ewar whereas you may have dedicated one or two modules and now a booster to countering his fit yeah thats fairewar vessels typically have minimal damagetanking bonuses in favour of ewar bonuses intended to make them actually viable ecm platforms this means that with those ecm modules neutralized or countered they are very weak indeed compared to other vesselsi might be more in support of your suggestion if there was a corresponding booster available that increased ecm strength by similar amounts more depth in strategy counterstrategy and countercounterstrategy is good nerfing ultraspecialized ships is not
if you wanna talk about fair lets talk about that falcon or blackbird jamming out an entire 56 man cruiser gang with relative impunity maybe you should try small gang pvp before you make a comment on it also liang stop with the kneejerk hyperbole comments that make you look like a massive 
being the eve drug userlord that i am i like this idea a lot to address a few concerns posted1 as the op said this will hardly impact large gang warfare see below for a minor issue i have with it2 unprobable ships make it so this drug takes the same slot of xinstinct sig reduction3 nerfing ecm yeah its a slight nerf but honestly i doubt this booster will be so op that it gains widespread useone thing i would change is the scan resolution penalty make this a locking range penalty instead this way sniper fleets have a serious risk of using this boosterwith biology lvl 5 rank 1 skill no reason to not have it at 5 if you are using boosters you get an hour i have used blue pill exile and xinstinct in pve just sayin
that single ecm ship that has dedicated his entire fit to ecm permajamming 23 eccmd battleships whove dedicated their entire fiti to combat certainly is much more fair noecm ships are a force multiplieri by drastically reducing the effective combat capability of an enemy force a job they do handsdown better than any other ship ever period of course this isnt even counting the tremendous effectiveness of ecm drones  ever been jammed for three cycles in a row by a flight of ec300s in a double eccmd battleship its gotten to the point now that many people have replaced warriors and valks with ec300s and ec600s and are running ridiculous amounts of ecm ships in terrible ecmnonecm ratios in gangs the result 10v10 gang fights become 10v4s and when running in a smaller gang trying to engage a larger gang its commonplace for the larger gang to have more ecm ships than the smaller has ships totalits funny you talk about more depth in strategy counterstrategy and countercounterstrategy since there really is no viable counter to an ecm ship save for running as many eccms as they have ecms  on every ship in your gang or simply outnumbering the enemy by two ships for every ecm boat they have even then you cant actively defend against ecm
so you have a 5men gang and didnt have a plan for blackbird on the fieldimho you deserve to die
nice ideawe just need to get sure this new booster wont share booster slot with blue pills and exile
ive done a lot of smallgang pvp and i can tell you right now said blackbird pilot was comically fortunate to pull that off and the failure of even one jam can result in deathperhaps you should argue with facts instead of resorting to adhominem tactics such as calling people s eh
this is a good suggestion i would like the booster to give you much better sig strength than any of the mods currently available stats need to be worked out but for now the idea to balancecounter ecm without it being a direct nerf is welcome
warping off and leaving whoever is tackled to die isnt really a valid counter in my books having most if not all of your entire gang basically forced to sit there and die while being able to do literally nothing except hope for a missed cycle is not only horrible gameplay it encourages bringing more numbersaka blobbingnow sure it is possible to get these ships off the field but with the time it takes to either get in rangeand hope to not be jammed or get a warpinand hope to not be jammed when you land you will have already lost one or more of your gang thereby multiplying the effectiveness of the ecm shipsof course if mr ipwnateve wants to bring a 5 man cruiser gang over to bleaksdevoidheimatar then ill be plenty happy to show you just how bat overpowered ecm ships are in the context of small gang and solo pvp
ive been in a pretty damn near max skilled scorpion and failed to jam one battleship one single battleship for every story where a blackbirdscorpion permajams an entire fleet i can show you a recent story where it failed to get the jams off that it needed like i said  im pretty big into efficiency and ecm just isnt it anymore yeah you see the occasional solo rook flying about but honestly theyre hardly a threat anymoreecm isnt a plague anymore and we dont need to nerf it again if you want a eccm booster i kindly request a booster for ecm and damp and td and painter while im at it strength as wellnope but ive sat there in a noeccm hurricane and been unjammed for 23 minutes with a cloud of ec600s on me ecm is chance based and ymmv you only remember the epically annoying times and fail to account for all the times that someone tried to jam you and faileda single ship that is eccmed up will either kill or drive off every ecm ship on the field ive done it so dont tell me it cant be donelianged formatting ah there it is in the post i quoted how frustrating
ive flown them ive done it and had it done to me so yeah im speaking from experience
an excellent point op edited3it would be logical for this booster to occupy the same slot as xinstict but the problem is that xinstinct is slot 1 the same slot all those great solorelevant tanking boosters occupy the best solution would be to add the ecm booster to slot 2 and move xinstinct to slot 2 as well
as a sometimes ecm pilot i find that drones are a good counter to ecm a tanked blackbird cant last long agains a flight of medium drones
supported
im going to support this but i think it needs a little tweakingperhaps the solution to ecm isnt in combat boosters lower jam strength faster cycle times effects similar to ecm bursts and lockbreakers skillsrigshighslots that improve sensor strengthjust some ideas they prolly suck but think about them
even lower the jam strength is really just a problem for cruiser and belowthink it through faster cycle time means more chances to get jammed so it is effectively a boost and longer cycle time would mean failed jam hits way too hard and the ship becomes useless lets say we up the cycle time to 60s you always have to keep in mind the whole thing is chance based one failed jam and you have to wait 1minute until i get a next chance 1minute where my primary defense is down thats like 1minute where your shield boosterarmor rep takes a break sounds fair to youso instant relockyou already got mid slots low slots and implants that can boost your sensor strength to almost impossible to jamthey do suck for surei think liang hit the nail on the head people only remember all the successful jams against them and never count all the failed cycles against them that made them kill the other gang
well limiting the losses can be worth it but it depends on the situationhow about having one long range hitting ship aka a caracal burning away from the fight until it has a good distance to the blackbird chance is range dependent so suddenly you get a few volleys off from the caracal or even get the sensor damp on the blackbird a very simple counter imhouhm  you make it sound like it is not fair when you loose ships while being jammed but it is totally fine if you loose them to a dps slug festbeen there done that
wholeheartedly supported a great and viable solution to the constant unreasonable menace posed by ecm compared to other forms of electronic warfare ecm not only accomplishes their relevant functions but completely dominates the engagement an iwin button is not welcome in any sized engagement this solution shows a great sense of ingenuity and creative thinking
now this is a boost to ecm warfare that makes sense definitely supported
supported ecm has no effective counter and remains entirely to reliable at eliminating multiple opponents with ease this is the start of a taking a balanced approach
did you just say that ecm ships are not worth flying you deserve to be crucified
proposal does absolutely squat for anyone except bcbs hulls which coincidently have little issues due to more slots and higher base strengthadding a percentage only does not help the ships that actually need help cruisers and down as they have negligible sensors to begin withunless it is combined it will either be too little to matter or make them useless for bcbs  numbers numbers numberssince those occasional failed jams require 600m in implants and at least one slot to even be possible when flying cruiser down i think it is more than fair to ignore themby the way the lower cycle time is a perfectly sound idea when combined with lockbreaking requires bsbc to keep spamming eccm and sebos as lock time can be atrocious while allowing smaller ships to avoidsurvive what is currently a guaranteed permajam almost regardless of fit skills implants etcthe only problem is that it would require ecm pilots to actually pay attention ie no longer an alt job function as a sebo interceptor could no longer be evaded indefinitely by slapping a single racial on it not supported as it completely ignores the ships that are actually in need of help against ecm
very good
before talking about booter drugs for sensor strengh first we should talk about the most bugged part of ewar the ecm drones how the hell is it possible that you get jammed by a cupple of ec300 with a sensor strenght of 102 points and most times not just one cycle or two but up to tree or four thats just plain stupid it just doesnt seem right that you get screwd or gotta run away with a 2b clone and a ship for roughtly 3b just because youre up against 2 hurricanes who deploy ecm300 drones or did i miss something
f yesalso anyone who thinks ecm ships are not worth flying is selfevidently playing some kind of game that is completely unrelated to eve
thats probably what devs said about the area effect doomsday device and titans long ago
every 6 months the narf ecm stampede comes alongthere is a counter its called eccm its not because you concider eccm a waste of slots that it actualy is
not supportedi am not trying to offend any ecmhaters when i say grab a blackbird and try it out you will see how much it fails right nowother arguments were covered very well by liang et al
interesting proposal tho personally i still prefer my own
while im not normally sympathetic to ecm whine threads your solution is one that i actually like itd need to be part of a bigger overhaul to drugs since drug mechanics suck right now but adding in an eccm drug is actually a pretty cool idea
after some thought im going to support this drugs are woefully ignored by the general game in any case and this could also help in that area
im okay with having a drug that functions like eccm theres a drug for almost everything else what ive always wondered is why have eccm and sensor boosters why dont sensor boosters you know boost the sensors i think that wouldve been the better change to ecm rather than nerfing the range of ecm shipsthe more counters put into the game against ecm the more those poor paperthin ships need their long range backedit support conditionally
there hasnt been a counter ecm thread that i liked  until now the booster idea is great becasue i think it will work well for a solo pilot  yet have a limitted effect on gangsfleets often times it takes fleets close to an hour to pull out of station the negative to caprange will hurt the logistics pilots so they probably wont use it often or risk gimping their effectiveness sometimes when i just a have a half hour or so to play i will go out solo and take the bait knowing i will likely die but knowing that you are going to get jammed right before i can kill the bait makes it a complete waste  dont bother logging in unless you can wait for a fleet this idea seems to address that without ruining ecms effectiveness in the gangfleet context
not supportednerf ecm some more and with missiles already heavily nerfed and with limited usability outside pve you have effectively kicked caldari out of the pvp forever
thats funny i dont hate it plenty of my corp mates dont hate it please speak for everyone moreecm is fine caldari is already bad enough for pvp dont take away their little viability also just because you consider the solution to be bad doesnt mean that it is bad theyve dedicated their entire fitting and a considerable amount of training to being a dedicated ecm boat you need to sacrifice a slot or two if you want to counter that an unjammed ship can make quick work of a blackbird claiming they keep 5man gangs entirely locked out is exaggerating and would require a huge amount of luck get jammed on
you dont actually expect people to use those do youi mean that would be like using eccmwe need a counter that doesnt need us to make a sacrifice dammit111sarcasm
this isnt a nerf against ecm i fly ecm ships often and have nothing against this exceptfunny how much these drawbacks are antiew make the negative effects outside of the ew scope and id support also why is it you havent modified your post to support a booster that would help ew pilots what is good for the goose is good for the ganderas you point out in your op this would have limited and desirable changes
put the ecm optimal range on a falcon at 15km and give it no fall off like the neut range on a pilgrim then you will know what a nerfed recon feels like
your pilgrim also has 2 ewar bonuses just as a falcon and with the tracking disruptor bonus you actually got a chance to survive inside 15km and none of your ewar is chance based cry some more please
while this has absolutely zero chance of happening it would be the right thing to do
ccp do you find it concerning that so many of your subscribers are reserved to never seeing the past expansions fixedis it a healthy business that has customers with expectations so lowif you continue to fail to meet such low expectations what could be the result
qft but supporting anyway
nothing tells me he didnt write that ive seen some csm act like turds and idiots recently complete childish irresponsible behaviorand they got elected anyway this is supported for sure
how could anyone not want walking in stations more than a game that actually works
currently it is next to impossible to use blasters in missions because you cannot approach the npc quickly and end up spending more time chasing npcs then actually shooting them many gallente ships have bonuces to mwd but misisons do not let them be usedsolution allow mwd use on ships of sise apropriate to the mission onlythe reason mwd use was banned as i understand it is that people used to kite damage in frigates my proposal is to allow use of mwds on cruisers and up in lvl 2 misisons bc and up in lvl 3 misions and bs and up in lvl 4 missions that will allow gallente to use blasters in missions while not allowing people to use interceptors with mwds i would like to note that mwd where allowed for use in all nuyllsecurity sites and that does not seem to be a problem while enabling more interesting pve and hybrid fits
2 things bother me a bit about your proposal1 speed tanking rats in a frigate is actually easier with an ab than it would be with a mwdi run lvl4s solo in an afs without any problems2 if you fit an ab on battleships you should normally be faster than the npcs torp golem with ab is quite fun i am not saying it would work for all missions but there are many missions which you can run in a blaster mega or so damsel veng atleast sansha version the extravaganza missions assault vs serps just to name a few
wi am not sure about the first point that was named to be as the reason you are not allowed to use mwd in missions if that reason is not valid that is one less conwhile you are faster then most npcs with an ab it takes ages to close in range for example lets take a typical gallente battleship with a t2 ab will go 300350 ms depending on rigs most npcs go 120200 ms that means that you will be aproaching them at speed of 100 230 ms because they will floy away from you now when you have 20 npcs to approach and they orbit you at 40 km thats a hell of alot of time you will spend chasing them on the other hand mwd lets you get in range quickly kill the npc get to the next one and so on
id like to put forward a very small idea just to help the player base concerning pi extractors and resetting them after the cycles are completehaving 10 planets over 2 toons with excess of 80 extractors its a terrible click fest which serves only to waste 2030 mins of my life just to reset them all on a daily basis eve is an enjoyable game but aspects of it do become very tiresome this extractor resetting process is one of themcan a drag box not be implemented so players can select multiple extractors in one go and reset them all piecemeal ensure that if the user does this all extractors have to run to the same cycle time if the player wants to vary his cycles then he must reset the extractors in the same process we all have to use currentlythis simple method would really make life just a little easier for everyone and cut down on a very needless and long winded click fest
bump
f yes
not supported in your version there is no point in tipping the balance the other way that does not accomplish anything for the game
i have a levi on the test server if i hop out of it and back into it it blasts my shields down to 54 of 35 or so million on a resist fit boat granted i doubt that people will have a reason to unboard the titan and get back in it on tq like that but maybe they want their primae just that badly if you guys want i can even get fraps and record how long regens work so theres video proof of the times that they are giving sokratesz if you want me to hide the mods in the video i can if they want me to actually do it its your bird
first woah this thread is still alivesecond i dont think a video would be needed tbh the numbers speak for themselves
yeah i was just saying it because reading though on the no votes it seems like a lot think that the numbers on time measurement think its an exaggeration
this is an updated proposal the main issue discussed was the possibility of preinjecting skillbooks the main purpose for this feature is to be able to queue skills requiring prerequisites to train while training the prerequisite skills themselves the current game mechanics require the prerequisite skills to be trained fully before injecting the more advanced skilltbh my initial proposal was clunky and others had better ideas on how to deal with this my thanks to herschel yamamoto liang nuren and especially vanklomp for thier suggestionsthis from vanklompid prefer a system which allowed me to preinject any skill i own but prevent me from learning it unless i have the prerequisites trained this would at least allow me to queue up skills that will be valid once the current skill completes ie training ham to 5 inject ham specialisation and add it to the queue as long as there is 24 hours remaining on the current skill ofci cannot phrase this better than he and any changes to the system would have to be 100 dev based so i will let the proposal stand at his quote
supported
i 3 itliang
yes ive been wanting something like this since the skill queue was introducedbut i see a few practical problemssay your prerequisite skill is short and at the end of the queue and you add your new skill behind it then you get pod killed losing attribute implants which increase your skill training time that your new skill or even the prereq skill drop off from the 24h queue what happens with the skillbook is it reinstanced at the station where your clone was or do you want to make it so that any skill can be injected regardless of prereqs but only trained if the requirements are fulfilled edit saw that you meant the latter
i could have sworn that the learning tutorial even said something like this is possible  if you want to train a skill all relevant prerequisites will be added or something like that maybe i was just misreading somethinganyways supported

support if i bought the skill book i shouldnt have to carry it around until i can use it

yes please a quality of life convenience
not supported popping people with skillbooks in their hold is fun got quite a few ones even some mildly expensive ones over the years popping people
1 learning chains of short skills is always a pain
i like it
allow injection disallow queueing the skill unless requisites are trained disallow removing a skill from the queue unless its dependencies are removed first seems a simple enough solution and itll make the learning curve far less annoying
supported but with a little changeusually if i have a skill i have to inject which has a prereq in the queue i have to add some other long skill to the end so that i dont waste time for examplesomeone is training large projectile v so they can use large arty spec since they cant inject large arty spec until large projectile v is complete they could choose to1 waste some training time and the next time they check their queue after large projectile v ends they can add large arty spec2 put some other skill after large projectile v and it will get a tiny bit of training until you remove it and put large arty specwhat i think should happen though is not have the ability to inject every skill book you buy but only ones which the prereq is learnablefor example you could not inject large arty spec until you have large projectile iv complete  thus able to learn its prereq of large projectile v you can still only add it to the queue after large projectile v and if you remove large projectile v from the queue then large arty spec would be removed as well since its prereq is removed
i still dont know why the queue wasnt setup to work this way initially
enough positive support to give a thumbs up myself thanks for the support fellas
supported good idea
supported
the war dec mechanic does need some lovin this isnt it not even closenot supportedahs
bad news the entire game is designed around nobody being immune to pvp his way is ccps way by letting rich players pay their way out of any and all pvp you have now created a group of people that is immune to pvp and that opens up a slippery slope of people complaining about haves vs have notes and before you know it theyll have to make miners and mission runners safe tooface it this is a pvp game if you dont like it give me your stuff then quit
umm this isnt a pvp game this isnt a pve game either its a game based around the delicate balance one group creates supply one group creates demand its a complex marketing simulationthat said im not sure whether this idea would be successful but it seems to be the best solution posited so far to fix what is a broken mechanic i have been on the receiving end of wardecs with some of my alts and its no fun and too cheap i can make enough isk to fund a wardec against an entire alliance for a month with just two hours of mission runningwardecs are perhaps the main reason why there are so many people in npc corps even with the 11 tax rate they recently introduced wardecs are in need of an overhaul alongside other issues with the corporation ui poses roles etci have read a lot of whining about isk sinks and some of them are valid but it doesnt counter the original argument if this is not the right solution please propose one which would fix it
no this would only ensure they are waged against poor people aka noobs stupid doesnt even start to describe this idea
interpretation of opim a highsec carebear with more money than sense i angered someone dangerous and they wardecced me why cant i just throw money at the problem and make it go awayim a highsec carebear that fears wardecs and even i think this is a stupid idea if you want to throw money at a war in hopes that it goes away hire some mercs or go out there and do the fighting yourself
large merc  griefer corp wardecs a smaller one who cant pay up anyway  wouldnt change a bita smaller corp seriously trying to take on a slightly larger one for example denying them highsec mining or easy access to trade hubs  they would just get outbid this would lose any pointnot supportedpay to shoot at each other who would ever want to live in that highsec you speak about
the micro modules were there to make it easier for newer players to fit modules to frigates but for some reason ccp withdrew most of themsome people still have some but to make t2 versions it is prohibitively expensive example micro capacitor batterywhy these were removed was never satisfactorily explained so i propose ccp reinroduces them as they help newer players more than anyone else
i propose not that we eliminate wtz persay but eliminate the ability to accurately warp to x without some form of random deviationit is debatable whether or not the game was healthier before wtz what is not debatable is that the game is much better off without the thousands of bms that we hadhow this would workyou would still have your list of warp to xxkmyou still have the ability to create bmswhat this feature would introduce is that across the board whenever you warp to xxkm you would actually land randomly between 15km or 15km of your intended target you might warp at 2km you might warp at 0km you might warp at 15kmwe all know 00 has bubbles im not trying to make them obsolete or anything like that what this would do is slow down travel a small amount a few seconds per jump in most cases more larger entitiesie get a scout or escort per usual sopthis would allow for more opportunity to engage with the local system inhabitants other possible effects top of my headmoar pvp boost to low sec kinda ties in w moar pvpslower travel  more work to haul region to region likely boost to hauling as a tradeless 00 camping see below many other aspects would come into play as one can imagine we dont just warp to gates do we we warp to poss stations belts wormholes etc etc etc in each case the same logic applies more of an opportunity to meet people of new and interesting cultures and kill them you otherwise would have not stopped to meet as a closing comment id like to say once upon a time old salts like me viewed eve as a very large game we have not gainedlost significant space however changes such as warp to zero jump clones jump bridges jump freighters probably forgetting some have made this game significantly smaller while for some of these changes this has opened up opportunity for new professions other changes have simply made the game needlessly smaller nothing in eve should be overly easy especially travel and avoiding conflict while in 00 you can put bubbles all along a given high traffic route this is not an option for low sec or high sec pvpultimately this would lead to more gfs in low and high sec and in 00 the ability to report a target in x system and have a chance to intercept later in the route without having to resort to a drag bubble camp though still an option may lessen some of the need to camp overly large bubble campssubmitted for your approval unless you just really feel travel should be as quick and painless as possible i cant imagine this not being a much better solution to an issue fixed by implementing what we now know as wtz
it wouldnt lead to more good fights in lowsec or highsec it would lead to more suicide ganksnot supported
i miss the time before wtz where lowsec was populated by gate camps to bust supported
am i allowed to support my own threadim supporting my own thread
negativewhen i bookmark a spot in space i want to fly to that spot in space not to some random spot near that spot
i like the idea in general but 15km is too much deviation imo unless its curved somehow so that the rng has to really hate you to land you that far out
people who would like this ideagatecamperssuicide gankerslazy pvperspeople who would hate this ideaeveryone elsepeople who would really hate this ideaminers 15km is the maximum range of unbonused strip miners and those ships are the slowest in the gamehaulers more time to get suicided and freighters take long enough to go anywhere alreadymissionrunners since that 15km warpin would apply to mission acceleration gates toocombat probers since warp to me doesnt mean warp within a 15km bubble of meas a combat prober miner and occasional missionrunner i say this not supported
you people are so shortsighted unable to comphrehend nor ponder the long term consequences of your actions you seek this change of course to make pvp easier for you but did you for once think that if you get things changed in the game and make things to hard for your desired victims that they will simply stop going to low and nullsec your kills will go way down your trying to make it extremly hard for carebears in the game and seemingly unable to see how that might negatively effect your kill statsif you make things to hard for your prey they will simply leave this is a horrid idea the only way people will venture into systems where they can be killed is if they know they have an out you take away warp to zero that just makes it that much more risky and people are less likely to venture into dangerous areas
i love this ideayou can also add a skill with it to improve accuracy by 1km per lvlso with max skills it would be  10kmthere is alot of potential here diffrent ship types could also be given diffrent max deviations so as to make certain ships slowermore dangerous to travel in and other fastersafer
on behalf of the professional freighting communitynothank yougabe
appreciate you commentingplease remember eve lived with warp to 15 for a long time some of us that have been here for both wt15 and wtz have had the ability to weight the pros and cons of bothi do not seek easy pvp however if you interpret this as extremely hard for carebears all i can say is when i was a carebear i used to move to 00 one ship at a time with a scout often get ganked and still made a profit nothing in eve is supposed to be overly easy eve revolves around opportunity and opposition its what makes it a great game and while i can respect that many people here may not agree with how i wish the mechanics to shift i respectfully suggest that what you and they want for yourselves may not be what is best for the game if anything the past has shown us that even the most fluffy of carebears were able to survive and adapt with wt15 and keep in mind this mechanic would be even softer than wt15 was you might land 2km you might land 0 you might land 12km
yes but now they have wtz if you give someone something then take it away it angers them much more then if you just hadnt given it to them in the first place
thing is the game didnt survive with it nearly as long as you think the reason warp to zero came in was to clear up the millions upon millions of bookmarks people created to circumvent the warp to 15 system that was in place  essentially people had already beaten the system and ccp simply bowed their heads in defeat and made it so this was also a time far removed from the eve of today  the game has evolved for years based on the presence of warp to zero allowing for things like freighters to be useful what worked back then with a much smaller playerbase with many fewer ships with an entirely different development status will not necessarily work today
god no having to make a 27 jump jita run to resupply even with wtz is tedious without it in an indy ship do you have any idea how long it takes to go 15km in one
wtz on your pos oh im sorry you just ended up 15km out and have to slowboat your freighterdreadnaughtsupercarrier under the shieldsno thanks
not supported on the grounds that it will encourage bookmarking of stargates and stations anywayi keep the following in neocom  notepad under the title stargate sizes simply because i was curiousamarr system      4946 mamarr constellation   4646 mamarr region      14 kmamarr border      26 kmcaldari system     7065 mcaldari constellation  8998 mcaldari region      15 kmcaldari border     28 kmgallente system     6754 mgallente constellation  9412 mgallente region     10 kmgallente border     38 kmminmatar system    4995 mminmatar constellation 25 kmminmatar region    24 kmminmatar border    42 kmsmuggler gate     ive only seen a smuggler gate on singularity and i didnt write down the size that appeared in my overview so im not sure how big it is the periods are just to keep the almost evenly spaced in the ingame notepad note that these sizes are diameters so their radii are exactly half were concerned with the radii heremost stargates are system gates rather than constellation region and border thus most stargates have a 25 km radius and a 25 km jump range beyond that to minimize the effect of a random 15 kilometer deviation players will start creating custom bookmarks for stargates again by flying a small ship right into the middle of the stargate theoretically when one warps to a bookmark at the exact center of a stargate the ship can land no further out than 10 km from the jump limit this would be useful to some pilots like freighter pilots to minimize travel time between dropping from warp and reaching the gatea moderatesized minority of stargates are significantly larger than this so a bookmark placed at their centers would have even less maximum deviation from the jump limit than for small stargates a few stargates are just so massive that their radiiplusjumpdistance are larger than 15 kilometers so warping to a bookmark at their center will guarantee still being within jump range these include and are limited to all four border stargates minmatar constellation and minmatar region gatesstations are also susceptible to being bookmarked in this manner many stations have a geometry such that its possible to get a small ship near the center of a station to bookmark the center docking requests are accepted once a ship is within 500 meters of a stations outer boundary sphere that is at a distance of 05  size  500 meters from the center of the station most stations however are gigantic when compared to system gates and all stations can be bookmarked in such a way that a 15 kilometer random deviation is still within the docking perimeterbesides the problems with the particular proposed mechanic as described above finding some other way to eliminate warptozero that players cant work around using bookmarks sounds like a bad idea because it will just frustrate normal travel that happens during the majority of the time when pvp isnt happening during travel
not supportedbesides the obvious issues with moving a large slow ship like a freighter around imagine having to move an entire fleet every gate the entire fleet would have to stop wait for all the bs to approach gate etc in addition it would cause issues with stealth bombers setting up bombing runs warping to a certain distance from a titan to bridge through and then oh no you are way too far or you land right on top and bump them the problems with this are endless
um no travel takes up so much time already it was a change for the better to have wtz i would even make autopilot wtz but i am aware of the intended tradeoff second tactical positioning is the key in small gangs  how would you like your rr group being spread out 30k from each other every time you do a tactical warpif you want to gank random haulers going through gates put up a bubble
i dont like it here is whyinterceptors covert ops and recon class those ships need to be able to get to places fast and accuratelyhaulers freighters those things are slow very slow and people who use them and play actively when moving about will hate it if they wanted to autopilot they wouldacceleration gates ever had to warp out and then slowboat to a gate in a mission or a plex imagine having to do 15 more km in a battleshipwarping at range you want to warp to 50km to be at your optimal you can now land at 65km and therefor your tactic is now ruinedprobably a lot more things wrong with this
this
supported but i want it modifiedpersonally id prefer the deviation to be greater the farther you have to warp to get to the gate ex a 88 au warp from one side of the system to another would land you within 1510 km of the gatea sort of lockon strength
not as curious as seamus but most people are aware theres a radius and will bm to kill as much of the deviation as possible as a former iss bookmarker i can tell you going back to working with bm on every single gate and station from every possible angle is not desirable not desirable no support
i see you suffer from selective memory let me remember something from the time when warp to 15 was in effectpeople used millions of insta bookmarks to warp to 0 and dont forget that at the time 20k player on line was a high number so in reality warp to 15 km was operative for noobs people without the isk to buy the insta for multiple regions people that hadnt before in that region people that hadnt the time to do insta for whole regions essentially wtz was in effect for 90 of the player with more than a few weeks of experience living low sec and 00so there is not a golden age age to return to
fail post i cant even be bothered to troll
careful you may slip in that pool of drool at your feets
not supported i have played other games that did this to stop people from macroing and guess what macros still existed because there are other ways to macro other than having a windowed mode all taking away a windowed mode will do is cause people to use 3rd party programs to force the game into windowed mode or if you are like me on linux will do nothing since i am running eve full screen in a virtual desktop so the game thinks its full screen
i now realize how dumb this was and i apologize but the bolded statement is a possibilty
i am not sure if i understand what you mean by have them all attached to your clone at one timedo you mean if i get podded i lose all my 5 racks or just the current active rackbecause if you just mean the current rack then yes that is exactly what i mean if i enable my rack 1 scanning set and undock in my buzzard i risk my rack 1 scanning set i get podded all the implants from rack 1 are toastbut if you mean when you are podded you lose all your implants from all your racks then that would not be very good i should not lose potentially 50 implants to fly with 10 it would again reduce the viability of expensive implants or using any more than one set and be worse than the current systemto summariseyou can change between which rack you want active only at a station or smayou cannot replace installed implants they must be removeddestroyed you cannot move an implant from one rack to another rack if you are flying in your active set and you get podded you lose your active set i 100 agree bugger these generic 200mil implants i have now when im in my scanning buzzard i want to use the multibillion implants for that hour of scanning increased reward by actually being viable to do so increase risk in loosing the bloody things if someone pods me its actually not a big change its really fixing a flaw in the way it works now that bottlenecks implants i believe this bottleneck is unintended and takes away from the game rather than gives it is all a matter of perspective people will not see the implant system is flawed until they are in a situation that makes it apparent so while a reader may think now that this is all a big hurf blurf about something that does not effect them further down the road in their eve career they might view this thread in a different lightits not an easy thing for me to explain i am not the greatest writer i am sorry if my lack of concise writing ability has made people inadvertently miscomprehended this whole suggestion this change is not gamebreaking for me i will survive on regardless i just wanted to point the flaw out and a way to fix it i see a lot of positives and very few negatives until then im sticking to my generic implants and well to anyone that is trying to sell a lowgrade virtue set sorry bro not yet maybe one day you will get my isk dedit also thanks for your feedback it is appreciated
i have no idea if its already been suggested but heres my solutionyou learn skills points in each of your attibutes instead of learning a skill how many sp you get in each attributes still depends on your attributes once you have enough sp you can buy the skills so no need to log in on monday at 2100 to get new skills in queue per exemple all skills will have to be modified to get the amount of skillpoints for the 2 required attributes which would require a bit of simple math with the formula in use since this solution is in conflict with the learning skills get rid of them as it was already porposed give everyone a refund and a 10 to their attributesedit  main advantage is that you can be away from the game for a very long period of time and no need to log in cathrina can go down on your house once the house is rebuild you can buy the skills you want training cant get interruptedwhen you log for the first time you select the combo of skills in which you learn skill points intel  memoryx perception  willpower charisma  willpowereach skills will now display the number of sp required for each attributes
i believe everyone wants to fly one of those shiny concord hulls theyre just too pretty to be left alone right well i have an idea that would let us use concord ships but still with a rp feeling about it so we have faction warfare which lets you fight for your faction what if there was a concordd signup where you can work for concord while youre in their corp it could work out like this when you sign up you transfer from your old corp to concord or a new corp if ccp wants to keep concord for themselves concords role is to punish criminals right so all players in the corp concord would share killrights with every player in highsec dont want to canflip anymore do you but we dont want everyone to cruise around in awesome ships either right so to limit the use concord pilots should not be able to accept missions or leave highsec but to compensate for the losses youll be allowed to use the beautiful concord ships i saw some thread regarding concord ships how theyd require all faction frigcruiserbs skills to a certain lvl to pilot which i believe is fair opinions
read thisthis is an old idea and not likely to be one we see getting implemented any time soon
since the csm has been removed for breaking the nda is it not logical for us to have another election
i know absolutely nothing about the csm but i assume the runner up would get her spot
wut
thatd be about as logical as talking about how ugly someones baby is
only one member of the csm has been removed and this is why we have alternates
first of all i am aware theres another remove learning skills proposal by kaya divine which as a far simpler solution i support i decided to make another as it offers alternatives to what seems to be one of the biggest objections by those opposed to removal of learning skills kayas point number 1 that everyone gets 10 10 to attributes equivalent to current max learning skills as well as addressing the claim by some to want strategy or more complexity in regard to skill trainingkayas points 2 and 3 remain the same in this proposal2 learning skills are removed from the game3 players are redeemed all the skill points invested in learning to train elsewherepoint 1 changes1 players get 9 to attributes and no  percentage probably slightly less than what the typical older player has now when you take the lack of 10 into account1b new skill added advanced cyberneticsadvanced cybernetics allows the use of newly discovered takmahl cybernetic implants requires cybernetics vskill level 1 allows the use of a 5  2 to attribute implantskill level ii allows the use of a 5  4 to attribute implantskill level iii allows the use of a 6  2 to attribute implantskill level iv allows the use of a 6  4 to attribute implantskill level v allows the use of a 6  6 to attribute implantmax advanced cybernetics  top tier implants will put a player at close to what max learning skills are now  4 bonus to attributes this is a path for the wealthy and long term plannerwhere these skills and implants come from isnt critical to the proposal other than they be hard to get rare and therefore expensive1c new profession of implant harvesting combining with a sub profession of drug manufacturing to create learning booster drugsnew skill added takmahl drug manufacturinga skill that allows the manufacture of learning booster drugs from resources harvested from implants of corpses higher skill allows for the manufacture of better boosters than lower skillrequires drug manufacturing vfound at archeology sites new skill added implant harvestinga skill that allows the extraction of resources used in the making of learning booster drugs from the implants installed in the corpses of pod pilots higher skill extracts more resources from a corpses implants than lower skillrequires biology vfound at pirate faction lp stores learning booster drugs give anywhere from 4 to 24 temporary boost to an attribute for a period of 24 hours  boosters of the same attribute type will not stack higher percentage bonus drugs require better resources which in turn require corpses with better implants installed the exact quantity of corpsesimplants required to manufacture a learning booster drug would need to be balanced in such a way to make intentionally podding alts an expensive propositionlegality all learning booster drugs and their manufacture is considered such a heinous crime that concord has become directly involved and has taken a zero tolerance stance possession of either the drugs themselves or raw resources for making them in high security space will result in the seizure of the illegal items the destruction of the ship carrying them by concord and a security penalty on the pilot equivalent to have illegally podded another pilot pilots currently on learning booster drugs will be treated as if they are outlaws of the worst kind forfeiting the protection of concord and subject to attack by concord in high security space as if they had 10 security rating the standings are temporary and the pilot will return to normal security standing once the effects of the drugs end and no more are taken harvesting of implants may only be done in a player controlled outpost or pirate controlled station with a medical bay manufacture of learning boosters is the same as regular boosters
i dont think that the solution to the learning skills problem is by adding more skills that includes advanced cybernetics because everyone would have to train that in order to progress the same way everyone else doesas for the suggestion of learning boosters if you think more about it you will see that this is buying skill points for isk well maybe not directly since you are boosting skill training time but its basically the same the limitations youve mentioned would not stop the free and massive production and distribution of those boosters everywhere in game including highsec player have been and always will smuggle large quantities of illegal boosters deep inside highseci appreciate your effort but i cant support your idea
i like this idea an additional thing about the salvaged implants would be the possibility to combine those example 41 imp  2 imp42 imp  3 imp43 imp  4 imp44 imp  5 imp
perhaps i for one would be satisfied with simply removing learning skills and giving 10 10 to everyones attributes or close to those numbers and calling it a day however a significant minority strongly object to that solution and proposal is an attempt at compromise also aiming to influence what i consider positive changes in other aspects of the game rather than just having a shallow time sink like the current learning skillsthe proposal is at its heart more of a conceptual one the details and numbers are flexiblegoalsremove any pointless time sinks done simply by removing learning skills and replacing them with both free bonuses and activedynamic means of boosting attributesnot hurting the new player experience new players get 9 to their attributes like everyone else can slowly move up the cybernetics skills tree as they can afford the implants and get learning boosters once theyre ready to leave high sec theres no artificial barriers any more to them to get in game and play it giving the 55 learning skill people something that should appeal to them advanced cybernetics isnt for everyone i personally wouldnt train it very high if at all like the current advanced learning skills its a training investment thats only going to pay off in the very long term however now its also tied into the market and has risk attached to it as well as implants can be lost and are costly to replacerewarding risk takers getting more people out of high sec and encouraging more pvp thats what the learning boosters are about one big problem i have with eve is that to advance your character you feel compelled to play it safe well unless you plan on sitting your character in a low sec or nullsec station for the duration learning boosters require you live a little and maybe die a bit too its also another isk making avenue that for once can come from pvp not just pvethe points you make are a concern but i dont think its as bad as you make outit may well be possible somehow to smuggle these drugs into high sec im not sure how myself but ill accept the possibility however i dont think thats a big problem because unlike regular boosters with these the second you undock on these drugs concord is going to blow up your ship and your going to take a huge security hit given the drugs give a percentage bonus to attributes and its only going to really impact learning time with regular consistent use theres no big advantage by using these locked up in a high sec stationas to buying skill points with isk i dont think this is the same theres a limit to how much bonus you can get theres risk involved and its tied to a limited resource implants in short in terms of isk for skill points its not much different from attribute boosting implantsi didnt expect a lot of support most players have rallied behind either keeping learning skills as they are or removing them and adding the 1010 to everyone theres not a lot of middle ground and given ccp is more likely to go with something simple and easy than something complex like ive offered no ones likely to budge from those positions for now
the t1 salvage prices are in a much better condition then the t3 salvage so are the t1 ores there has never been an 11111 times difference in ores
having perused the csm white pages the restaffing of the csm alternates is not really mentioned  at least not clearly i do believe that the csm needs all the alternates that it can muster having looked at the attendance of the first three meetings at least one alternate has been required in every meeting in the first meeting two were required and only one attended now with one alternate mazzilliu being promoted to full csm membership i think it would behoove the csm to have a full cache of alternates at its disposal especially since of the remaining four alternates there is a combined attendance of 3 meetings as far as promotion the most pragmatic approach would be to go off previous voting results so the 15th place finisher would be the new alternate smug
supported
i approve of this handsome idea
tldr supported cos elise is pr0
i too support this initiative
if attendance turns out to be an issue then ccp can look into this same as they did in csm1 but midyear promotions being a rule seems a bit silly it should be a judgement call imo
the colour of the planets in the scan feature planet view mode makes everything confusingwhy mot make the planets black and white in scan scan colours would be clearly visibleit would be like a real survey map
blast im not the first onebegonenothing to see
my proposal is to have a version of the primae that functions as a mobile customs office with the same functions and capacity for planetary material 25k m3this serves three purposes the first of which is giving the ship a real purpose to existsecondly instead of having to go to a stationary customs office that becomes a central hub for ganking you have a mobile platform that isnt quite as easy to ambush this allows people to float cans far enough away from the warpin point of planets to give them some reaction time to get out of harms way in low secthirdly i really dislike the idea of customs offices in wormholes it makes a lot more sense that youd have to bring your own facilities inside the wormhole
i support this idea on the condition that you are forced to bring the primae ongrid with the planets warpin pointonce on grid and out of warp you can importexport materials just like you could from a planetary customs officecombined with a lack of planetary customs in wspace this would make a lot of sense rpwise as well as making things more interesting in lowsec
without ganking pi would and even more riskfree form of passive incomebut it doesnt make sense to have customs offices wormholes so something needs to be done about them
supported although i believe 25k m3 is maybe a bit too much to ask for to make this ship more vulnerable maybe add a contact timer so it would require the mco mobile customs office to stay put for a certain amount of time before the load reaches the mcojust some ideas to balance things out
i kinda agree with this25k m3 is far too large though maybe something smaller like 1015k making it a modified industrial hauler also give it a highslot so cloaking can be done but make it so that the ship cannot be cloaked when launching a container or retrieving oneoverall the primae was another of ccps pattern  a great idea with faulty implementation modifying it and releasing it on the open market would be a great thing
a couple things1 youd have to be decloaked if a cloak were ever an option to send or receive2 youd have to be in orbit of the planet in question though not necessarily at the wtz requiring wtz proximity makes it no different than the customs gankfest of course you can always probe down the ship3 you wouldnt have as much capacity 25k is fine for an established satellite but the ship should be smaller so youre still inclined to use the customs now and thenas for wh mechanics i agree that having customs is a bit odd another odd thing is the fees for transport i pay to import i pay to export but where are those iskies going its not like we have regular convoys taking colonists back out to kspace
supported in principle but 25 thousand cubic meters might be a bit much 20 thousand perhaps this would match the capacity of two planetside launchpads
someone from the csm should remind ccp of a little expansion that a group of players created at the small vegas gathering last yeareve online corruptionif none of you know what this is ill describe it a bit later on im just throwing this out there
so the back story to this is i logged in this morning to finish a mission i had not completed before having to leave town on a family emergency and found that i got a mail within a second of logging on ohnoes my agent was angry with me but amusingly the system time this is immediately after logging in not long enough for local lag effects is 1039 and the mail time is 1040 either me or my agent is a time traveler and ive been ccpd out of my standingsso one thing ive noticed is theres no consistency in rounding rules some things get rounded up or down if negative value and other things dont clearly the agents round up to the next minute something that gets most of us fire in the real world concord rounds down on sec status you cant enter highsec once you hit a real status of 45 and progressively up for the less negative sec statii yeah sure thats a word but faction police are lazy and they dont start pestering you until your faction stating hits a real 5rounding should be consistent across all the systems theres already a lot of complexity in this game i think we dont need fuzzy math for extra oomph on that 
thats stupid make them all use the real values
you arent risking anything more than the miners if you arent interested in leaving highsec your income should be much lower than those that are
not supported of coursebtw does somebody have a rough figure by how many  the iskh income for missions decreased
pathetic amongst the variety of things i do in eve i grind missions in hisec when i cant avoid it and the so called nerf has had a minimal effect on my or my corpies income from those missions as to the risk with a properly fit ship there is no risk in hisec missions unless you count the high possibility of falling asleep from boredom and waking up with a copy of the keyboard stamped across your face if your having problems with missions diversify and find something more rewarding there is plenty out there to do
and now having a conversation in local is impossible meaning it might as well not be there
unsupportedif this came in all youd see is vast hordes of pirates and their alts in noob ships to pad the numbers high enough to cause a concord nonresponse marching through high sec smashing everyone in sight to hilarious results and unfortunately account cancellationsand lastly the safety level of a system would change on a constant basis not everyone is able to just relocate on a whim to another location and still be able to play effectively youd be hurting those peoples playstyles just to try and solve the jita problem indirectly when you could just try and solve the jita problem directly
also you say you want to destroy jita as the sole trade hub rens dodixie and amarr would like to have words with yousecondly jita evolved naturally due to a combination of central location quality agents drawing in mission runners in the early days ccp removed the belts the agents and so forth but it was far too late jita has become a self sustaining phenomena it was made by players and thus its part of the holy grail of ccp  player driven stop trying to kill one of the demonstrations of natural economic development
so basically you want to move rens to ammol and all the other tradehubs to other starting systemsdont really see the difference also leave low sec alone
proposing a change to security status of systems is the oldest troll in this game please try harder your trolling is not creative
this is it  the worst idea in the history of the assembly hall in years to come your clone babies will ask you where were you when cifese made that ing awful proposal daddy and you can say i was there son i was therethe horrorthe horror
agreed 100pretty much anything where someone can damage you and you have no way to protect against is stupid imhoi killed the guy i took heavy armor damage to do so and need the money to pay for italso there is everyone saying go to lowsecguess what i tried going to lowsec and very quickly got multibs ganked in highsec i can actually get a fair fight with someone of equal size to me much more fun that waythis coupled with pitboss earlier thread of neutral rrepping would fox highsec pvp for me almost entirelyedit apparently i already supported this thread earlier on
but some of us make a very tidy living off the wrecks of the victim of gankers they the gankers dont like it for obvious reasons but its seriously fun to do but the really clever part is that with the game mechanics i can reroll an industrial flying alt every day no sec status hit you see perfectly legally  so youll never know if that empty speed fitted hauler sitting on the inbound path to a gate or on the undock to a station is gonna snatch ya loot right from under your nose nothing like ruining someones day when they see that all that hard work goes to nothing as their juicy target ends up in someone elses hold now those are very sweet tears to suck on
i dont know why people are going to support this it wont change ccp has said before the wreck belongs to the victim and no one else and who ever gets there first gets the spoils of war and they already get flagged to that player who owns the wreck and the entire corp they belong tosooooomove along now nothing to see here
all good points that take my base problem identification and provides a more elegant solution thanks for the input need to rewrite this so it can be supportable now how to do it hmm
signed on the condition of aforementioned edit although i remember reading something about injecting notyettrainable skills in one of the csmccp meeting minutes and ccps response was something along the lines of wanting to keep the character sheets consistenttbh i have on many occasions wished to have such a feature but then again i usually just queue up whatever is next in my plan and inject and queue the newly available skill when i log on next so it is a bit annoying but not terribly so
 newtoday eva ankhesentapemkah jobse was removed from the council of stellar management due to a breach of the nondisclosure agreement nda we are deeply saddened but feel that it was the only possible solution in order to protect the integrity of the council of stellar management as this is a matter regarding confidential data we do consider this to be a private issue between eva and ccp therefore we are unable to comment furtherevas response so farfurther informationarticle on massivelyevas blognote as has been stated by several csm members now the critical stance in her blog andor her blog have nothing to do with this please keep the conversation civilized and do not spread more rumors
so uh since i was 15th does this mean im now an alternate 8
i suppose some dev went emo about what she wrote in that blog
ye im gonna go ahead and say this was because she made the comment about ccps position regarding them doing jack  about fixing the game as shinies are more important to themguess ccp dont read shc forums or anywhere else as mynxee and other csms said exactly the same thing lol
inb4 ankh carebear white knight squ nvmi would hope she also got banned ingame aswell need update as anything less would be an injustice
why would she be banned in game larkonis wasnt
lark did get banned it was just a 30day
haha feels really good to hear ccp now announce that youre gonna remove the learning skills and it will be the one of the most happy days ever
why would such a comment get her bootedevery eve player whos been in game more than two expansions knows they release stuff halfdone and never touch it again except maybe to shut off the isk faucet of farming cosmos plexes fw lp exploiting without touching the core failures of the expansionits the life of eve
napc takes full credit for thisalthough more information would be nice br anyone
she was also so unfit for csm that it couldnt be any worse perfectly she is gone i hope she also get a banshe was nothing buy a power hungry wannabee that lied and spammed en mass
the csm white paper has been adjusted since then and its not as if she enjoys the game they say immitation is the highest form of flattery and i for one welcome our new mazz overlord how horribly ironicin all seriousness i think everyone needs to chill the  out until the facts are known
my mistake you can breath again relaxas long as there is no reason given there is no reason to assume she did something worse than lark maybe she was also asked to resign but refused lark attempted to get ingame advantage using his csm info if ankh just leaked something it isnt as bad imo but that is pretty pointless speculation
removed personal attacks and spam
ah furb killer always quick to jump the defendankh bandwagoni for one am happy to say that i also do not know what she did and thus i cannot comment on whether it was worse than what lark did apparently there is a clearly defined scale of those things somewhere please point me to itin fact it doesnt matter what she did the consequence is what matters
good questioni dont believe that happened during larkgate best gate but as csm5 still has 9 months left who knows what ccp will decide
nice going ccp so you are kicking out the only csm that actually dares to stand up for the playerbase that doesnt just use the csm charade because thats what it is as a way to get a free trip to iceland and for what for actually trying to keep the community informed for being the only one promote the transparency which was the whole point with the csm in the first placeand her replacement another elitist pvper the people that ccp so love to favor the csm is a sham a pr ploy and thats it its more obvious now than it ever has been before ccp doesnt care about what the playerbase thinks its all just damage control from a terribly managed company with a serious lack of professionalism or business ethics its just sad to see good people who actually mean well get dragged into it and humiliated publicly in this manner i fully expect this post to be deletedcensored fully in line with ccps policy to get rid of anyoneanything that doesnt blindly fanboi and defend them removed discussion of moderation zymurgist
or not
i didnt know i had to post a full scale of possible actions and how bad i would think they are before i get your permission to make a post i am sorry for this oversight and will correct it next timeit seems pretty logical to me though using the info for ingame advantage is worse for me than for example telling people ccp doesnt think fw is a problem if that was under nda but like i already said and apparently you missed you honestly miss quite often stuff that is written it is all pointless speculation
in her blog eva discusses measures that ccp are planing to implement to reduce lag she mentions two specific actions that they are planing since this is technical insider knowledge i am pretty sure this is covered by the ndayou can read her blog at
well thank god for that
ehm in what way she certainly doesnt represent my interests in any way shape or form and doesnt in the slightest stand up for anything id like to take to or from the csm meetingsgood seems suitable being a pvp game and all
the only players she represented are the whiny little carebears that have helped erode this game over the past couple of years
just a general fyi she was not kicked over stuff mentioned in her csm blog
actually all that information is years old its been in ccps development pipeline since about 2008 they had devblogs on it and ive mentioned it in articles ive written so its all public knowledge
my 10 dollars is on ankh throws spoons at people how can we get rid of her subtly oh look breach of nda puntcleared a personal attack  adida
you all realize that the csm is nothing more than a pr thing for ccp i love ccp i consider myself a fanboi but in reality any type of player interaction on that kind of level is just a pr thing will they use the interaction with the csm for planning development to some degree yes will it really make any huge difference in the direction of eve not reallywhy would you sit there and bite the hand that feeds you so to speak and not expect consequences for it its not surprising she got booted if i was ccp id be kicking her to the curb too its bad pr to have crap like that said when youre supposed to be doing something to improve public relations for themi would not be surprised if her observations on ccps attitude were a wee bit skewed anyways ccp isnt some giant governemental agency out to oppress its players etcthey will do what they need to do to produce a product that will garner more sales for them thats the whole point of being an entertainment company too many people treat gaming companies and developers like they are the man and do this angsty teen rebellion crapshe seemed pretty useless anywaysi would not be surprised if they ended up cancelling the csm soon and just rely on feedback from some of the more vocal and levelheaded posters on the forums like a lot of gaming companies do the csm was a good idea on paper but from watching it here and there i think its turning into a pr disaster
wow not only is there some heavy drama within new eden currently but on the csm toolisten ive never been an ankh fan in general for the csm however i do hope this has nothing to do with her blog summarizing the summit if so thats kinda petty that being said i dont know all the facts and she does have a tendency to say stuff that perhaps she shouldnt on other occasions so who knows what she said when well just have to wait and see if any further info comes out whatever the case it seems as though her longtime reign in the csm has come to an endalthough i didnt want you on the csm in the first place you did put a lot of effort and time into your campaign so i will say im sorry ankh bummer
thanks i am a bit surprised actually since that was the first mention of those specific actions that i have seen and yes i do read the devblogs especially the technical onesi am guessing some of the wild rumours that have been flying around has some truth to them after all 
this is very much like an old school totalitarian purge yesterdays hero is todays enemy of the people and the trial already ended with a guilty verdict youd better not ask for what crime or youll get the knock on the door in the middle of the night too
that was one if im lucky itll be two
thisi dont actually dislike her but if you agree to a nda than it seems reasonable that you get into trouble if you break it if ccp cant trust her she really had no future as a csm member and put the need to tell about the things she heard above presenting the people who voted for her
whos this yesterdays hero youre talking about
if you have evidence that ankh didnt breach the nda thats one thing otherwise youre defending her purely based on her personality which is immaterial here either wayi also take issue with your assertion that the other csms dont stand up for the playerbase her decision to promote her own personal csm wiki rather than work with others by the way is the opposite of transparency
justice was done today i wish to thank ccp for the removal of this unsavory candidate
perhaps ccp was going to implement a new turret that launched spoons and her chucking it at a meeting was breaching the ndahumor aside i feel this is a good change to the csm
it sounds like you know what was breached and through saying what that information is not you have narrowed the search space and through that also disclosed confidential information thereby breaching the nda yourself
well this was an obvious conclusion since multiple csm members posted the sentiments that were echoed in her blog so no i am not breaking the nda here in fact we arent being told anything either so im in the dark as much as you
about time dam time ankhesentapemkah got kicked and yes  my lvl 120 legendary paladin helmet allows me to see through the laughable attempts to defend by ankhesentapemkah white knights
everyone knows the csm is a waste of time ccp spending subscription money on shipping some players to iceland instead of buying better hardware and improving the game especially in 00
 what the wise man said
she leaked information about mechanical parts apparently something that will cause a huge price spike for those
ive been one of ankhs harshest critics but i have got to say this rubs me the wrong way we have no idea what kind of material ankh released no idea how serious the nda breach was no idea about anything really to be perfectly frank it looks as though ccp is trying to intimidate the csm after the disaster that was the iceland summit ccp we need details you cannot simply fire a playerelected representative without explaining to us what the hell is going onwell i guess you canbut it wont make you look very good
smoothly done that man
is pobvious that it was a hell of a lot more serious then larkonisgate as ccp havnt released any infoim under the assumption that she leaked subscriber info or game plans to another company rather then messing around with the balance of eve market manipulation lolwouldnt be suprised if ankh finds herself in real trouble if this is the caseps did i say lol arleady roll on tamber for a sub
everyone already suspected that ccp has been doing nothing nothing nothing about performance issues on the serverissues weve had since decembercode problems that somehow were to be fixed with a networking upgrade lolive had this rotting feeling in my gut that it wasnt that ccp didnt want to fix the problem its that they have no one there that can that actually knows how and they dont all the people that know code are off working on some other ed project so here we are 7 months out from the beginning of the problems and likely another 7 months before you ccp even attempts to address the problem carry the 2 im supposed to shell out literally hundreds of dollars in subscription to a game you bastards know isnt going to work at any given time and take dust and incarna development as my reconciliationhow about noseriously have you not heard at all that the vast majority of your players want function over form we want to be able to play eve 1 first and foremostwe do not care about shiny this and that crap are you lot ed how can you have such a massive amount of fail prioritiesi shouldnt be surprised im sure some manager that gets paid too much to think about things he knows nothing about has ordered full steam ahead on development of new featuresthat nice steady incline of customers youve seen wait till they realize you care less about retaining them and more about attracting more new onesim having real trouble justifying my account payments now i do not want to quit eve but if this is the only option i have left to voice my opinion then what else should i doits not like you lot are listening fix the  game its that simple its not like we arent used to waiting for features long after their promised or never get delivered at all at the end of the day we want to be able to play the  gamefind the idiot that thinks new shinys are good idea and wants to blame csm people for telling the truth when his stupid ideas are ruining eve and have them read this post then try to convey to him just how many of his customers feel the exact same way
now come mynxee socratez teadaze and traebor didnt get kicked as well then
what is this larkonisgate thing back from when apoc came out and gates went ed i didnt pay attention to csm until recently
well all know ccp is all about the integrity of their various relationships with the players so this is no surpriselol for real why not just say they booted her cause they felt like it ccp doesnt give a crap about the csm or the average player either everyone knows that they arent protecting anything other than their own butthurt feelings probably
sup broagreed and fixed
larkonis trassler was in the csmafter a meeting with ccp where they announced the complete revamp of the t2 material requirements he bought a load of technitium aka inside trading although he said he had looked at the market and saw a big spike in demand so assumed the secret was already outhe was forced to resign
lets hope sok gets sacked too yes he cant stop screaming on the net about how he doesnt take his csm job super serious and stuff like that
trust as we learn playing eve is a difficult thingi cant really say im sorry to see eva go as i didnt get along with her really well however im very sad this happened to the csmmost of us on the csm are people with whom ccp has learned to dialog with and the newest additions mynxee and trebor fared well in that regardanything that undermines ccps abilitypropension to have open and honest discussions with us annoys mei dont know what eva did what i do know however is that its different from larkonis larkonis got drunk ed up and admitted it to ccp he got offered the chance to resign and he took iteva seems to be a different thing altogether since she got booted and didnt resign what for i have no idea maybe well know maybe we wont
im fairly sure she wasnt representing you and your ilk so what you say cant be true
it wasnt tech it was in fact something that went down in value post dominion sadtrombone and no specific details of changes moongoo or otherwise were released to us the spike was caused by a rather rich corpmate of mine acting on his own to try and manipulate the market for that particular good he wasnt aware of anything that i knew hard to believe i know but trust me on this in my semi inebriated state i put two and two together got 5 and foolishly acted
mostly this shame it had to happen two years in a row as a player i appreciate the attempts of ccp to create a channel to the player base even though it does not result in any immediatevisible changes
or maybe she got the option to resign and didnt take itbut dont let me stop the speculationbtw open and honest discussion does it really matter if ccp tells you open and honest they completely ignore the csm instead of lying about it
seems i was wrong in assuming why she got booted but still the csm is a good idea on paper horrible pr disaster in realityccp would be better off courting certain players and reading their own forums which they do actually read the forums p than trying this csm garbage the biggest problem with the csm is it is putting inflated expectations out there that just simply wont be met peoples imaginations on what kind of impact the csm will have on development went wild now its just breeding annimosity from what i can seethe biggest problem with involving players at the level of the csm is many of them are not software developers even though everyone that plays mmos claims to be one there is a lot to software development and maintenance that the average player doesnt understand and wont understand no matter how many times you explain it they percieve the explanations as apathy rather than actual limitations of what can be done in the immediate future and most gamers cant think past the next month in most cases
doesnt she work for another game development company seems like that wouldshould disqualify you from the get gonot surprised on this one
this is an unfortunate occurance also this would make mazzilliu csm member
so she got kicked for breaching the nda with her inconvenient blog but shes not the only csm to write a blog so we must wonder why she has been singled out to bystanders i voted for some body else this looks like the hate campaign succeededi guess those haters gotta hate
violating a nda in a serious manner as a game designer is pretty much career suicide
when in the course of typical mmo asshattery it becomes necessary for a developer to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with an elected player representative a decent respect for the opinions of said electorate requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
not only that but she lists ccp as her employer on her cv cleared baseless personal attack  adida
that wont look good on her cv
need more information on why the nda was breached i dont know ankh or really have a position one way or the other but given she seems to be unpopular theres always going to be an undercurrent of this being done politically rather than due to an actual breachplease give more info when its possible to do so
qft i dont like ankh but we deserve to know why she got booted
good riddance to bad rubbish
i was always wondering why he kept disappearing into those hidden bunkers at night
hmm sounds like someone does know
no we dont since theres nothing anywhere that stipulates we have the right to in fact the opposite is more likely true
i dont particularly like the way ankh does things or the way its reported she was acting at the summit but this just seems too convenient to me tbh right after ccp gets bad press from the csm the one who wrote the first blog against them suddenly has some 2 year old nda breach noticed and actioned against thats some awesome timing right there tbh
ive not yet blogged about the summit in any detail because im waiting for the official minutes so i can pick them to bits i felt it was a bad idea to do so however it doesnt appear to be the cause of the nda issueit would be nice if ccp would clarify the situation a bit because the lack of details are just causing more wild speculation
if this occurred well before she took office why the hell was she allowed to take office in the first place actually i guess i just answered my own question they didnt bother to look
bolded for those with selective reading habits  ive read the blogs from the various csm delegates during and since the summit nothing evas blog or anyone elses contained any new information that would constitute a breach of the nda furthermore the release from wrangler says specifically confidential data was involved this tells me she got her hands on something she wasnt supposed to and action is being taken either because of what she got how she got it or what she didwas planning to do with iti really dont think ccp would outright remove someone from csm because they talked about something in the minutes before they came out or something like that lark fd up and essentially committed insider trading due to his foreknowledge of game changes its not clear what ankh did to get removed but it must have been considerably more serious than telling people stuff they already knew on her blog in any case i hope all the take care supporters take care to be more responsible in the candidates they support going forward
can we get some kind of information other than she violated the nda and was removed i mean i dont particularly like what she wants to implement at all but if any csm member can get removed like that with with almost no explanation whatsoever it doesnt bode well for the futurecant believe im sticking up a bit for ankh
perhaps it took place before she took office and ccp just found out huh but that wouldnt fit the ccpcsm haterz plot to vilify bothbest to wait on an official report before putting your foot in it hmmmm
we do knowit was for nda violations thats all were going to get most likely
are you ing serious
thats what i said  i think a background check should be done for each and every csm candidate as thoroughly as possible it is a liaison position after all
ccp while you have ur boots on you should fire sokwhy dont you just clean house and start over
wish i had voted for ankh then i could claim i knew the future and saw this coming and used it forthe lulz
omg she said she was in the csm on her cv get to the forum mobile111what exactly is the point that on a document on her personal internet site she calls it employment history and not something else
so do you white knight often or just for ankh
so when are you having the talk about working at ccp or have you had it already
that document my friend is a curriculum vitae also known as a resume to our yank brethern she lists ccp as her employer you know as in she works there and gets paid and that isnt kosher
such a coincidenceyeah right out and out powerplay by ccp reknowned for their love of constructive criticism as they are blog as a cause rofl i think standing up to ccp is more than enough for this to happen sacking a member for a 2 year old offence dont make me laughsacking the csm with the 2nd highest vote ptaking of the highest order nice one ccp youve just spectacularly lost any confidence i may have retained in youcheck this well considered response and continue to watch this space for further infoz i expect the next few weeks to be quite eventful unfortunatelypersonal attack removed zymurgist
not sure about other countries but i believe i am right in saying in the uk at least lying on your cv is against the law
removed an image that revealed personal data  adidain that case btw furb since i had lunch at starbucks today i am the ceo of starbucks now
its all a conspiracy of the antiankhsentimentbandwagon
actually its standard practice to list voluntary work on your cv under employment and as it clearly states in the cv you linked its non profit ie voluntary in those posts so there is nothing wrong with her cv altho its a really ing ugly layout on that website
edit nm i saw her full resume
more plausible explanation than being fired for posting identical information that other csm members wrote aboutbut i think its clear ccp hates us all ive gathered that by reading this thread some parents beat their kids ccp allows lag to occur in a 1600 ship system i feel like this frog to ccps monkey all too often these days we live in dark times gentlemen
ding dong the witch is dead
she just said she was in the csm she was i wont stop you if you say you had lunch at starbucks on your cvon mine i also got an internship listed under employment history still waiting on the cops coming to get me
although ccp said it was confidential stuff id still like an explanation preferably no more then two words just to stomp out the bushfire of speculation not spoongate would be fine otherwise people will and already have just go zomg ceeceepee powertrippin and that would be bad
except that you never list them as employer since they are not and implying they are is as far as i am aware actually illegal here  and especially not don when you work in game design and then get booted for nda breach after visiting a well established software house and being given access to sensitive materials there effectively committing career suicide
you would list voluntary under another heading like hobbys or even voluntary work rather than employment like she didif she were to get a job with a uk based company with that cv then she would be in serious trouble getting a job by lying on your cv is a criminal offence under the fraud act
massively has posted an article on this wow theyre quick
cv speak english its called a resume
this is all speculation until we know something concrete for example it is quite common for whistleblowers to be scapegoated and for pretexts to be used to eliminate those who are unpopular with those in power or if as dierdra says this violation of the nda occurred before csm5 then it may not even be relevant to her serving in that capacity for instance she might be banned from the game for a time but still fulfill her responsibilities on the csm5 and then again ank might have done something seriously wrong and deserve to be removed id like to suggest we hold off from arguing the pros and cons of ank herself weve been through that before and it does no one any good i do appreciate the fair mindedness of many of you who have opposed ank in the past but recognize there are larger issues at stake here id also like to urge the members of the csm to take a step back from editorializing and focus on ensuring that a fellow member of the csm was treated fairly and with respect this matters as much for you and future members of the csm as it does for ank recall that the csm was formed because of ccps serious issues with a perceived lack of transparency accountability and fairness anks removal concerns all of us for the time being we should all focus on getting a straight answer from ccp as well as ank herselfdelilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
and an even more plausible explanation is that she posted information that the other csm members were sensible enough to keep to themselves in accordance with the nda if youre going to spell it that way at least put the diacritics in there so it cant be confused with something that continues
you are seriously deluding yourself if you believe thatshe was in the csm she has that on her cv that it might be in wrong area is not something the cops or anyone else give a crap about one google by a potential employer shows what the csm is if he is too lazy to do that it also isnt relevant
a shame to see her removed it was nice to have variety on the csmkinda fitting that we have a bunch of clones on there now though
in fact its called a rUFFFDsumUFFFD and its a french word 
infact its called a curriculum vitae
no matter what she did ankh clearly thought she was above the law or at the very least thought she could get away with it good riddance
evas reaction
i knew it was a mistake to let such a fractious personality represent the people looks like i was correcttake care ankh
you are posting rubbish fyiand so are you my blog posts were online before hers and i voiced the same sentiments that she did so that was not what she was removed for
this sucks ccp if you dont respect the vote of the playerbase and kick csm members for flimsy reasons you should finish this ludicrous project completely or at least stop calling it democracy
even if the logs show nothing this is one shipht loss ill happily acceptcan we have maz back now move along now nothing too see here
to be honest im quite surprised her working for a separate gaming entity small or not didnt bar her from running in the first place as that could have been easily considered a conflict of interest
i say good riddanceit didnt take a lot of research into her character to see she wasnt fit for the job a particular chat log where she completely loses her cool over interweb spaceships and makes personal attacks comes to mind i believe it was covered in one of a few threads about her prior to the csm electionfor those of you who voted for her sorry you threw away your votes pay more attention next time
this tbh its a shame that instead of voting for a valid candidate so many people threw their votes away ah well sometimes you have to cut off your nose to spite your face i guess
thats bullcrap and you should know that csm was created to create transparacy and an insight into ccp after the t20 incident internal affairs is just as shady as ccps behaviour themselves if this particular case is one where we dont need details as it might harm the development of the game that should be put forward more straight uphaving a nda for the csm is just wrong by its own tbh since that kills the whole idea of transparacy and a csm without its original role just turn into a pr trick for ccp and a big waste of money that could be better spent no thats another discussion thohell you even see csm candidates asking ccp to tell us more on this particular matter
im betting her work on the csm will no longer appear on her resume oh and miyamoto isoruku you are an ank fanboy true to ank fanboy style you are just trying to deny it
candidates who thus did not get elected have no special privileges beyond those of any other eve player csm members likely find these things out as quickly as anyone else and ankh claims she will say more tomorrow
ugh i knew id write one word wrong and have some english talking kid hit me in the headmom
if her blog is even 50 accurate then the csm is nothing more than a trip to iceland
if your statement was 50 accurate thenwait nvm
confirming that free trips to iceland to talk about internet spaceships is srs businessso serious it would look good on your rUFFFDsumUFFFD
spoke to her in iceland a little during fanfest 09 she seemed alright and perfectly civil when not talking about evesadly shes one of those people who hasnt got a damn clue about eve how it works or the vision for the futureglad shes off the csm tbh for the best part her ideas and input were horrendous
marked for deletion  adida
im not defending ank at allbut this does draw attention to how unrepresentaive the csm are of the player basethe organized minority of serious corpsalliances dominate the csm pool but they are actually a minority of totalplayers most players play a game specifically avoiding large organizations that remind them of real life jobs
haha you do bring up a good point about large orginazations reminding people of real life jobs probably why im still part of a smaller corp p
the csm is representative of the population who bothered to vote
i voted for ankh and no i am not a carebear and yes i actually know a few things about evebut for lack of representation for high sec dwellers that atleast had some commitment i voted for ankhcall me a fool or whatever but having representation of only 00 stakeholders and or their pets on the csm hardly reflects the playerbaseits now easy to sling more dung like finnagain loves to do and some other people in this threadbut untill ccp actually grasps their own balls and acts on the transparancy they claim to work towards to its all guessing worknobody knows why ankh got booted from the csm and the few that do hush up as tight as possible because else they find themselves in the same positionccp should at the very least clarify if this nda breach was in regards with the current csm or as claimed by others towards something of 2 years agoso actually the ball is in ccps courtyard and people can hatemonger or white knight as much as they want it still remains rumour and speculation
this process is being handled exceptionally poorly
since ank is in this field i wouldnt expect much info her career may suffer by saying the wrong thing this means she will shut up ccp could get sued for libel if they misspeak i think ccp was hoping for ank to be more forthright like larkonis was on how things went down that didnt happen so i bet both sides clam up publicly rattle sabers at each other privately until they can negotiate an agreement or ank files suit for libel sure as a player i want to know more but its unlikely

shh be careful what you are writing about big brother is watching just look how many times they changed inconvenient postsyou have a choice  get a full time job in 00 or shut up  this is how this democracy works 
it reflects the part of the player base that cares about what goes on with the development in the game and who think that they can have any kind of influence on what ccp rolls outif they dont care they well dont care so it doesnt matter that they arent represented
wtf ccpankh csm best csmalso who read blogs
youve never looked up the definition of the word irony eh
ow so only the pvp players of eve that are stakeholders in 00 or their pets care about what goes on in evetalk about narrowmindedif you have absolute and irrefutable proof that high sec dwellers have no love for eve and dont care about eve and its progress then please put that forwardif you cant produce such proof doesnt this statement of yours qualify you as a classic troll then
wrongits representative of groups who voted in blocks learn to think
they live in highsec
empire simply has to vote for a better candidate next time
nope even though english is like my third language i dont need to sit with a dictionary at the pc as some othersplus i copy paste in general only whole comments to respond to and not partial clips to better suit my purposes
nothing good will ever come from empirenothing
there are plenty of good carebear candidates you just need to look a bit further than the first forcefed propaganda video
how about the fact that in spite of their supposed numerical superiority they apparently only managed to get one representative onto the csmas for narrowminded i noticed that you only picked up on one part of what i said when it could reasonably be suspected that the other part is more indicative of why the representation looks the way it does
csm has no more details than you guys do until ccp or eva choose to share more about the situation theres a real danger of wild speculation leading to insanely wrong conclusions while what ifs and i betchas are fun they are often inaccurateevas contributions to the june summit were positive and useful the triviality of spoongate aside i think once the minutes are published youll see that this is true by the way the minutes have been reviewededited by csm and are back in ccps hands i understand well have the opportunity for a second approval review once ccp has finalized their review and further edits we all apologize for the minutes taking so long but it was a lot of hours of meetings covering a lot of territory and were all interested in making sure that the minutes provide the player base with a good sense of what went on during the meetings the draft i submitted to ccp after csm revisions were done was something like 32 pages
i should apply for csm as a carebear candidate liang
im a highsec dweller not involved in large corps blah blah blahvote for me next time if i bother to run
as much as i would like to see this occur whos to say that ankh will not completely exclude the choice bits of info which put her in this current negative light to begin with id like two sides to this story so somewhere in the middle the truth can be foundyea yea tinfoilhat
please for gods sake dont lump all highsec dwellers we arent all carebears we arent all afraid of pvp and we arent all failed pies like the flipers  greiferswe all didnt vote for ank either my votes went on abstain and will continue to do so until i see a candidate that suits my industrialistfw gamestyle
this is actually quite funny seeing as everyone in eve comes form empire however it is quite true
awesome
fair enough  after all i did the same for much the same reasonstill the point remains the csm representation comes from those parties who take and interest in and who believe they can influence the route ccp will take i seem to recall that our abstain votes didnt account to much  certainly not enough to put anyone in the running  and the vote itself covered every kind of reaction from no suitable candidate to scrap csm so im doubtful it would have made any difference even if a good candidate did existeither way the core complaint here is that onoz highsec lost its only csm which as you point out is just bunk because she didnt represent highsec
welcome to democracy 101 aka poll riggingimagine you have 10000 voters and 10 candidates the population is split into roughly 5050 between city folks and country folks the country folks are split into five regions each region has one candidate for elections while the city has 5 there is room for 6 candidates in government each country region will get a candidate in but the vote for city candidates gets spread out between the lot of them  only made worse by the fact that some city folk are also hobby farmers so they vote for a country region candidateif there had only been two city candidates instead of 5 the two candidates could have easily taken two seats in governmentchoice is bad mkay
i would apply for a csm carebear position if i had the time6year eve carebear lolim known by a few but whether it would be enoughthose of you who think carebears have no place as csm are rather narrowminded i admit im a carebear but that does not mean i cannot change rolesi have enough sp to do that quite easily
no offence but democracy is a very broken goverment mechanicssadly the best of all tried so far
no thats the point of course bears have a place on the csm a very necessary place but rather than electing a viable candidate whod look out for their interests the voters voted for someone who was known to be unstable and unqualified people get the leaders they vote for unfortunately hopefully next cycle we can get a really solid bear or two onto the csm whos willing to work with other play styles and who knows what the game is about
are you commenting on the western world or eveonline im asking because your post has no relevance to eve
no matter what ccp says regarding youre now stakeholders the truth is youre not youre consumers with a voice if they choose to listen to your voice then yes the csm gets things accomplished if they choose not to then no they wontccp is a privately held company which means that a closed person or group of individuals gets to make all the big decisions and if they want all the little ones too as a business that now has at least three products either released or in the pipeline not including anything white wolf may or may not publish which is a gripe from white wolf customers eves priority may not be 1 and saying stakeholders just really means that youre people with an interest in what ccp decides to do while you can vote with your feet if it gets too bad you dont really have any power beyond that threat and theres no reason that you should be surprised if things change in ways you are opposed to them changing if ccp were publicly traded a player might amass a significant portion of stock and demand actual changes in priority or business method in fact there are some players that have significant resources and might be more than happy to do so sadly i am not one if you can give me moneys or a job or something ahemwhen i say three products i dont refer to incarna either dust is a separate product eve is another and the mysterious but heralded world of darkness mmo is the thirdpersonally i think it pretty much sets the tone when the csm doesnt have a chance to at least say hello to the ceo sure hes busy but doesnt everyone want to meet a real viking giant
kick everyone off the csm next year instead of buying airplane tickets for worthless csm candidates ccp buys a pool table for their offices it would be money better spent
i been voting they put a beer fountain in the lobbybrought that up as soon as the announcement of csm if theyre gonna throw away rl money at least do it in style
not everyone who lives in highsec votes for ankhe i got many carebear votes im a carebear as did teadaze and dierdra at the very least highsec proposals are not going to fall on the wayside because the one expletive removed memberactually this should be better without her in the way to emorage on every highsec proposal thats my opinion
yah but youre a modified carebear
next election i may put myself forward for csmi admit im a carebear but i also understand many other careers as i have been playing eve nonstop since early 2004i admit im fallible and will listen to all sides in any argumentbut that is a long time away
did you really use the word danger
you really should
absolutely this
this but in all seriousness its a tax writeoff anyways at least in the us it would be so really no real money is being spent in the long run a beer fountain though i think would be a wee bit difficult to write off on your taxes lol
lo ing lyou better be ing kidding me that is quite pathetic actually
representation anything goes there extra good for bar tabs in all seriousness does anyone take csm serious because seriously thatd be quite hilarious
lots of game companies do almost exactly what the csm does but they dont hold elections for it you get in the program from your history interacting with the developers which is where ccp should take their csm deal soe has a group of players similar to the csm but they were picked by community reps for the respecitve games and no the people in those focus groups arent all the asskissers on the forums
ccp should also dump any csm member who makes personal public attacks against other csm members this undermines the csm in general and makes the whole thing look like more of a joke than it already is and maybe screen for holes while theyre at it and people who make a complete mockery of the process and if thats not possible just dump the whole csm thingthere are a few csm members who conduct themselves in an adult semiprofessional appropriate manner some of these other jokers just f everything up while ccp could benefit from the input of a group that represents large swaths of the player base what ccp or the players dont need is representation from the chuckleheads that lurk in the game
does it really matter this csm is a bigger joke than the rest
ive abstained on all my chars every single csm its a joke
meissa please give some thought before posting denigrating comments about other members of the csm speculation combined with animus only reflects badly on you mynxee has scolded you before for this eg spoongate and many of us expect better from you as one of our csm representatives if it is helpful consider ccp fallouts words on a related matter of trolling delilah wildfriendsofevewordpresscom
could be me but according to massively eva responded that i do not share ccps conclusion that there has in fact been an nda breach sowho has the popcorn unsalted please
i love watching delilah and finn ones rabidly for ankh the other is rabidly against maybe one day theyll fall madly in love in spite of their political differences and get married or something feel good romantic drama of the yearso initial reaction hahaha oh wowsecondary reactionif this were anybody else on the csm i wouldnt so much as bat an eyelid but the fact that its ankh makes me suspicious not suspicious that she did something evil or vile but suspicious that this is just a simple nda breach it could be just a complete coincidence that the most talked about and controversial csm member got blasted for an nda breachpersonally i dont believe in coincidence
ok so we going to lose ankha from the csm she had the second greatest number of votes  with no alliancecorp block vote supporting her most of her votes gained by campainingin her place we get mazzilliu voted in with an alliance block voteshe tried to campaign on the low sec vote  showed she had no clue about how low sec workedher alliances low sec involvement appears to be dropping super caps on a few bs or smaller ships  for risk free ganksmade a cheesy campaign video that basically said look at me i am a girl  vote for meposted on the pl forums that she is not ugly fat  or stupid so deserves votes its worth getting a copy of her post personally i dont think this will be improving the csm in any way shape or form
imho the whole csm should be rerun with blocvoting disallowed
i guess ccp dont like hearing the truthhowever her evemailing spamming was frustrating around csm election she should of been globally muted for the spam
hold on  this is a csm member being removed not just a player of eve the csm is meant to represent us the players if one them gets removed then were entitled to a reason why ccp declared the csm as a transparent playerelected body thousands of people voted for this person and they deserve to be informed why shes being removed ccp  transparent as long as they look good
good seems suitable being a pvp game and all its not just a pvp game its a sanbox you play your way let the rest of us play our way
how would you do that
well presumably in ky vatta bizarroworld alliance members are disenfranchised
you must be joking how would you even define a powerblock also why would you do thisblocvoting is a consequence of democracy and the mindset of most votes  hes our guy rather than this candidate seems fit theres no way to prevent it while preserving the democracy
qft ive never seen anhk in game and i have zero knowledge of what her position on pve etc was but the megahatred of her on these forums seems from my perspective to be totally over the top if she messed up and broke the nda then its her problem and ccps since it was an nda violation i doubt well ever find out what it was she seems pretty obstinate though from all ive read about her so i dont imagine shell quit the game unless ccp boot her out she could however if shes clever not that she seems to be sue ccp for allowing the mass mobbing that has been going on against her in the forums the courts seem to take these things seriously these daysi think i need some popcorn and beer this is better than the world cup
hi black ive said this in other ways but it bears repeating i am not rabidly for ank yes my thoughts on the games principles and mechanics often align with hers and thus are at odds with the views of others still i suspect most of us share a greater measure of agreement than disagreement over eve moreover were i to have my druthers id like us to find ways to benefit all the sectors of eve there are certainly many great ideas out there from carebears and pirates and the alliance blocs indeed were the angels of our better natures to speak more often on this forum i think we would have a very productive conversation what i rabidly object to is the verbal bullying and trashing that has been directed anks way she is not perfect none of us are and i dont pretend to know whether her removal from the csm is justified or not but the character assassination no pun intended directed at her is undeserved shames its perpetrators and shames those of us who stand by and gawk but say nothing i know the anonymity of forums breeds irresponsible and contemptuous behaviour sometimes it goes beyond the pale and needs to be called to account im pleased and grateful that many of you have been doing just that thank you delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
i think black is more interested in whether youre rabidly for finn
until theres a second shard where there are pvp flags that are turned off theres only one server and pvp is allowed on every single square inch of it as long as youre undocked and you cant just play the game how you want because its an mmo and ccp has deliberately designed it so that no matter who you are and where you are and what youre doing someone can come and pvp with you whether you like it or not nah im not rabidly against ank and its not personal i am pro honesty integrity intelligence and for a stronger eve online game i found that ank behaved dishonestly withgout integrity and intelligence and acted against the best interests of eve online if shes behaved differently thered have been no problem just like la vista vista is a solid carebear but hes also an awesome guy who i had a lot of contact with during and after his time on the csm ive got no problem with industrialists or carebears but people who act like ank did deserve to be called out for it
it might have something to do with her saying these thingsas you can clearly see ankh is the very picture of mental stability and any rumors of her using cutlery to assault any other csm members are strictly not relevant at all really pleasetldrankh likes to call people psychopaths irl while being completely bonkers herself
so how much did he pay because i must say thats one hell of a sneaky way to give him a promotion
what did she know and when did she know itps csm edrama best edrama
its just me but if you reraised issues wouldnt that get ccp to realize that we really really want feature x
price just went up by 800 bil
how much for the spoonserioushow much
man and i thought my name was goodalso im pro sokratesz heshe is for shield buffs working like armor buffs
was it this spoon
i liked the first version much better dealt with the op on his level it didedit also necrozoosomethings link is golden
its nice to know that ccp really could give a crap about its player base and what they want and that they also could care less about fixing bugs that they have previously admitted they knew about anyone want to take bets on how much money they lose with dust devoting an entire development team and most of another to an fps that has to compete with games like halo and cod sounds like a recipe for disaster especially when they cant fix issues in their current game which of course is a completely different genre
im beginning to be afraid that dust could kill eve not just from poor resource allocation but also because if it is not integrated absolutely perfectly it will make eve dependent on a startup mmofps that could very easily flop in the meantime the bugs still arent getting fixed
on a more positive note i hope some of this low hanging fruit includes balancing issues ie afs rockets hybrids etc seriously it seems like you just have to change a few numbers and ta da subscribers get somethings they have been asking formongo
if it was a longstanding product then id say that dust could save eve diversity creating a universe bigger then eve a universe that cant disappearhoweverits a console fps game these come and go every weekbeing a console game the hosting will likely be cheap p2p connections between players which means anywhere other then the useujapan the player experience will be 300400ms latencywithout dedicated servers no community will grow and dust will slowly die over a period of weeks or monthsconsole fps games are a cash grab they are generally cheap builds on existing engines that are released for quick cash around xmas timethe console game market is not about quality products or longstanding franchise its a world of flash in the pan cash grabs on poor productcompare this to pc fps games which still have many dedicated servers clans and players years after releaseso where does this leave evewell if they lie about what dev resources are being spent and continue to allocate resources to dust at the expense of evethe mass exodus could be just around the corner if they continue to drop the ball with such stunning consistencyif they get back onto eve soon rather then ignoring it then they may well save the game from collapse
that is unlikely i dont think ccp will forgo centralized control given their current infrastructure and know how also since the dust world still has to interact with the eve cluster depending on the tightness of the integration there is little to be gained by p2p connectionccp hasnt stated if players are grouped by region but it is likely you cant expect people to play fps with 250ms latency so theyll put up regional serversi foresee the same result but with a different cause there are dozens of excellent console shooters out there and i dont see ccp producing a triple a title able to compete in that market i dont think the mmo integration as selling point will be enough to keep it alive eve is a brilliant concept with less than stellar execution it seems ccp thinks it can apply the same strategy in the console shooter market which is doomed to fail imo with eve ccp can get away with it because 1 there is nothing similar gamers could flock to 2 the game design attracts a very distinct player group which is above average acceptingcapable of living with the deficiencies both points do not apply to console shootersi completely agree which is the reason i think eve and console fps dont blendi feel the sameone can only hope that the csm managed to deliver a few wakeup calls as stated
have a feeling its going to be global p2p with the central server being done via xboxps3 achievementsccp have said nothing to allay these fears there has been no talk of dedicated servers and without dedicated serversi can 100 guarantee there is zero point in playing dust from australiathe major concern however is that ccp responds to csm requests for eve fixes withno we have no programming resources availableandi dont like that feature so you dont get it fixed
well see if theyre that stupidon the other hand the sooner dust dies the less resources will have bee spent on it and the better the chance ccp wont be ruinedthats not a concern thats reality
oh no who will represent empire grumpy and the sleestak
so the only csm member who really stood up for the csm and not just playing along for the free visit to iceland just got removed because of nda breachhow convenient
010 for trolling mah boiii

or notdont count your chickenswhen the truth will out then we will see
ccps not talking ankhs not talking and nobody else seems to know anything that theyre willing to let on assuming this state of affairs keeps up the truth is as out as itll ever be have fun waiting for more
i never thought id say this especially after dariuss attrocious job at commentating at the tourny but darius was good compared to you lot glad i didnt bother voting this time as my utter contempt of the csm has been confirmed
i have no confirmation of this but rumour has it she has been banned from eve
the pope has been banned from prayingi have no confirmation of this but rumor has it he has been banned from prayingtldr stop spreading rumors you jackass
no doubt anything which is considered a breach of nda would also be considered tos violation nr 18 for example
this probably applies here just as much as elsewhere

someone in ccp finally make this happen
long overdue
gosh it surely couldnt be the thousands of people paying 15 usd a month for a product a product which they would like to work properly i should add and if it doesnt then whos going to pay the employees wages to make up for the people who quit using a product they are dissatisfied with while the game devs we are paying are busy making another gamenot to mention that the op isnt the one who claimed excellence was the goal ccp themselves have touted it as their motto for the year or whatever
as a person who regularly experiences the pain of agiles oh we can release with x and do y later followed quickly by y isnt high priority compared to new z i know this stuff all too well supported for more polish  followup its something that all too many agile adopters fall into not necessarily the methodologys fault more the application of itand to answer yanis question  its not a matter of who should pay for this but a matter of prioritisation more time allocated to bug fixes ringfenced time for followup  polish on released features it just slows down new features it doesnt cost anything more from a dev perspective  from a sales perspective you have the question as to whether new feature z will yield more sales of subscriptions

although this cant be classed as one of the more important things that needs fixing in eve it is well supported and would be neat to have the cool cyno effect backtherefore im going to raise it in saturdays csm meeting im sure there will be flaming about csm focus on meaningless crap but if we cant have a little bit of cool in our game why play

not supported 1 all attributes to 302 amount of sps in learning skills should be redistributed by pilots them selfsfor me this is only acceptable solution to this problem
either a troll or a person with a very low iq i hope its the first option
i do not want to see the learning skills removed definitely not i like their role and ive invested a lot of time and sp in it all maxxed and now to see some1 who hasnt bothered training learning skills at all to have the same atributes as i do is ridiculous no offence there is a point to these skills dont remove them however if you do yes kaya divines suggestion is good
what point driving new players away who got a brain and dont want to waste their 3 months sub time just to sit in a station and train learnings good point truly good point
who ever said u have to sit in the station doing nothing while training learning
most idiotic stupid ed solution ive ever seennot supported
exactly i had a great time my first few months in eve i explored i mined i shot things and got shot i slowly worked learning skills inbetween other skills for mods and ships i wanted to play with my first few months in eve rank among my most fun times in the game been playing almost 5 years along with my first move out to 00 and the time right after the introduction of wormholes anyone who doesnt leave the station until they train all learning has a self inflicted problem its not the games fault theres lots of things a new pilot with no skills can and should do to have fun still not supporting the removal of learning skills
i dont think everyone should receive 10 and 10 i think that is a little bit too fast for training i think everyone should receive like 8 and 10 but i guess it doesnt matter muchalso i think ccp should refund the learning skill sp in lump sum  like the 100k sp we just received
id love another 24m sp that i could reallocate supported

its very sad when the csm must campaign for simple bugfixes because ccp prefers to divert ressources on half assed stuff nobody particularly wanted
i am decently sure the change was intentional that being said logging off in a supercap with 100 cap and logging on with 10 is annoying as  fix this 
once again clicking the thumb in a sok thread of awesomenessidk if it goes along the same systems as shields do but i did manage to have a domi not manage to passive rep its shields after being logged off in space with half shields for a month the pilot of the domi has capital level shield skills too so its not like he was lacking in that department

sorry ive been kinda busy i come back and see some people scared of blaster change thats awesome cuz im tired of scorch blasters must be the scariestseriously i have trouble believing youve ever flown a blaster shipdid you even read the first post blaster already have the most dps and best trackingsame as acs they do not need a boost th either of them the problem is extremely poor optimal range makes it impossible to deliver the paper dps this has to change what eaxctly is the problem with 3820not good at numbers are you optimal  falloff and 840 dps abaddon will hit 910 dps at 4510 armageddon will hit 985 dps at 4510 also you are using tracking enhancer on this rokh of yours put tracking enhancer on abaddongeddon they will hit 5213 and scorch apoc will hit out to 100kms easily shockomgwtf
support in halfsomething might need to be tweeked but not major changes rails need more love than blasters webspeed nurf did hurt blaster boats just nothign was changed to ammend this and the new tourny ships oh you should really have done something similar to thatas a gal char id like to fly gal more
we allready have 3 weapon systems that perform well at medium range we dont need a 4 to do sothe probem with blaster ships is they it lack the dps in small gangs for solo they simply lack the stoping power in web range it is not a fleet warfare weapon it is a pure small gangsolo weaponnot because it is very good at it now but because it worked this way before qrrails could use a bit more dps and more importent more tracking to make them usefull in sitations that you cant cover with blasters a lighter fitting would also help a lot to make more medium hulls usefull in rail setupsim looking mostly at the 200mm rail here
forget blasters theyre fine for now if you dont like not hitting cruisers fly a domi thats why gallente use dronesas for rails i do think they need tweaking but just adding dps makes them a poor excuse for artillery to actually see what needs to be done to them i think you need to look at the other 2 races of turret based dps shipsthe tachyon does medium to high damage with medium alpha at long rangeartilley which are awesome btw dont change these thanks does huge alpha with medium dps at medium rangewhat we need in my opinion is a gun that does medium to high damage with low alpha at medium to long ranges it fills a hole that the other two race long range guns doesnt give hybrids a huge rof bonus and reduce the cap need in line to that of something like an apoc using tachs what will result is a steady stream of average dps which we dont get from using any other sniper boat it fills a niche that the other races dont and makes things more interesting and balanced

it is 3 times the cost and it hardly matters in pvp if you dont plan to shot down a pos or a couple triage carriers and next to nobody uses t1 ammo in pvp
cost is a bad balancing factor take a look at the number of titans in game to see what i meanand when you spend 150 mil on a ship you do not care about additional 3 mil for the ammo because without it you just condemned your ship to deathlong story short only t2 ammo that actually works is barrage and scorch

hellojust a small idea i was consdering an alternative to the learning skill system that focuses on proactive gameplay rather than limiting your training for several months while training learning skillseach skill ingame has a base attribute for example a lot of industrial skills rely on intelligence with the removal of learning skills attributes would return to their base numbers players could choose to focus those with a remap or leave them balancedinstead of raising attributes with learning skills your skill training will do it for example if a player is spending time training industrial skills endlessly their intelligence will begin to see a bonus over time up to the maximum bonus thatd be possible if theyd trained their intel learning skills however should they decide to change their path theyd need to train towards a different skill set to see the other attributes raise eventually youd cap the attributes after lots of skill training the end result is that instead of leaving a character to train for motnhs on end or bouncing back and forth between your skill goals and learning skills youll raise your attributes while focusing on your chosen professionspaths
now thats creative good jobsupported
i think that is a reasonable method no instant gratification and a move away from the forced two month grind ill throw my support in on this idea
actually i rather like this idea cautious support pending any good objections raised later
i agree with malcanis on the cautious support the potential problems i see are1 assessing how the bonus characteristic should be assigned to older players2 the possibility to maximize the effect thanks to the remaps3 the low number of charisma based skills and the unbalance in some other characteristic leading to underdevelopment for some characteristic even if a player has trained most of the skills having it as a primary stat
this has merit and should be examined further
should be brought to more peoples attention for possible issues and balancing but the idea is good1 from me
i also cautiously support this with a note that it should take as long as it would to normally train those skillsafter about a month of playing you should be close to a iviii in all learning skills
this is the tricky one i think it might just eventually come down to instant skill point compensation the reason is by now theyd most likely have lots of skills trained which would mean they have already done what it would take to raise the attributes so itd be just easier to give back what was spent on learning skills that way anyone who did the 2 month stretch will find they are now 2 months closer to something else and at full attributes someone just starting or only partially through the learning skills would be rewarded similarly but have to raise the rest with the new system which is not really a setback not sure how to explain that one but the way i see it is that if a player chose to remap and pump up their intel then train intel skills thats their bonus its a bonus that is still accessible to others and then itll make raising a perception combat skill slower and mean those attributes will raise slower perhaps instead of making it skill points over time it could be the total time invested in a skill charisma may just become the common factor so training a fair chunk of charisma skills would give you the majority of the learning skill bonus to counter this they could increase the effect or increase the prerequisitesmaterials for implants making them more importantyes this is something i had in mind its meant to provide a revision of the system to keep attribute training an important part of the game but without the apparent grind or lack of productivity quite simply the most efficient way to raise learning skills is to hit them all with the skill bonus but it does mean you cant do much else in the meantimethat way it doesnt ruin things for veteran players but it does make it a little more interesting the first time you do it isnt so bad but on an alternate character it is a chore
always liked learnbydoing systems and this would be a good eve version of it especially for beginnersbut things do get a bit hairy for chars who put a lot of time in learning already because however attributes would be recalculated ccp can expect a lot of rantingall in all great idea that should be discussed in finer details and i support it
isnt it much easier to just remove them and raise our base attributes with 10 or 9 points i dont really see what this addsand the ones with most benefit will be highly specialised alts not rookies who want to look which direction they want to go to with eve
furbkiller translator which gives me the opportunity to train up more griefing alts even faster
youre right a simple solution is to just remove the learning skills and give us a baseline for our attributes the main goal of this idea is to preserve the original attribute building aspect to preserve some traditional rpg mechanics rather than just remove the system entirelyinitially yes but eventually itll even out just like a new character is behind in terms of skills within a few months they will become competitive in pvp regardless of how many million sp their opponent has
had a similar idea with a little difference youll slowly lose the attribute points you gained through focused training if the associated skills are not trained for a long time
id prefer if they just remove learnings and give everyone 10 stats but this idea is also good
this would be great for someone like me  an older player who already has a very solid base of skills and who wants to focus in on one type of skill for a long period of time but youll utterly shaft the newbies who have to switch back and forth a lot to cover for the fact that they need to train everything this seems like a textbook case of malcanis law  youre trying to help newbies by getting rid of learning skills but the replacement you propose is only helpful to older playersor focused alts who tend to be run by older players
huh maybe reread my postherschel i thought so too first but it isnt that bad since it doesnt decline in the proposal when you train other skills if that was the case it would be really bad for newbs
this is actually a really good idea would make training long skills less annoyingccp would have to decide on how much of your attributes would switch over obviously to make it balanced etc but i would really like this idea to be implemented1 internet for you sir
amongst what i assume is already a laundry list of fw fixes the player community would be quite enriched were we able to fight for the smallerpirate factions over perhaps smaller contested regions rather than lumping everyone into 4 groups players would be able to pledge allegiance to any number of the smaller factions with conflicts spread out and hopefully a little more fun along multiple fronts examples of factions players could joinblood raidersguristasangel cartelkhanid kingdomsanshas nationthe popularity of the recent ccp sansha events has shown plenty of people willing to assist a smaller faction sansha against the main empires obviously i understand there are plenty of fw fixes that need to be made but i dont imagine it terribly difficult to select some border systems sprinkled throughout the empires and implement the fw mechanics for some of the smaller factions in a future patch thoughts
sounds like a good idea to me more fw fronts and more dynamic politics might also breathe some life into the lesstraveled lowsec areas
you cant change this dynamic with a change in game mechanics its social behavior to subvert the nap system one would need to do a coupcivil war type action in each of the napped alliances so they split themselves apartalternately one could just start shooting blues until they were kicked out of the alliance this kind of is highrisklowreward unless you just want to see the world burnbut it happens if youre feeling destructive like this you probably would profit by turning coats to one of the other big naps first but to actually pull it off in any statuschanging way would require lots of willing conspirators due to the size of the big 3 but stuff like that happens with smaller alliances and large corps everyday and smaller alliances get their standings reset with the larger alliances pretty frequently due to politics isktribute failure to perform well in defense of their own turfetc heres the thing even if you break them up temporarily theyll more or less form up again maybe under new leadership maybe not naps may be boring but they are good for someones isk account heres another thing over time bigger alliances and stronger coalitions become more insolated and organizedbecause of shared idealogies history and accomplishments smaller alliances have trouble organizing and holding their  together because they dont really focus on building idealogies a history and accomplishments they dont do the babysteps that the other alliances had to do to get where they are they dont count the cost if you rebooted eve completely and everyone had to start over in noob ships and gain skill points from zero till now my money would be on the same general politicalnap blocs being in control of 00 as there are today with lots of the same people trying and failing to get a piece its player mechanics more than game mechanics
dis is an outrageccp should force friendly alliances to shoot at each otherit doesnt make sense any other way
womanbut yeah you are right just look at all the brownnosers in this forum agreed in partthe only problem is that most parents get slacky on the education and just raise brats who think that being an ass is the way to do it screaming is good but the example with kids is actually the worse you could get
i kinda wondered when i read her blogi definitely appreciated the effort she went through to put in so much detail but it did seem more than what id heard was allowable to disclose before the official minutesit probably didnt help that she had a tendency to let her guard down tact wiseminor though both infractions might be they certainly provide enough ammo when combined to legally justify a dismissal
as much as you like to hate ank she did go to iceland and be vocal and push ccp to fix thingseveryone else just seemed to be there for the cake and did nothing they said they would do during their run for csmi guess the initiative and having someone on their hands from the csm that meant business was too much for ccp to handle so sacking her was the best course of actionpr0 tip do not actually do what you said you would do to get elected if you want to stay in the csm
i am glad that this happened and i dont really care for the details but curiosity is started to get sparked
well ahk gave it the good old try at least we know ccp heared what probly needed to be saidand no im not a ahk fan but i would support my worst enemy in taking one for the team as a hole as ahk probly did
we will be getting mazzilu as a substitute facepalmi have some problem seeing what was this so serious breach that there was the need to forcibly remove her larkonis was given the option to step down before being throw out so ccp should feel it is something really seriousi would like some clearer statement but doing that without increasing the information leak probably is impossible so i cant support the request
more info definitely needed here the csm isnt much good if mildly vocal members get removed at a whim by ccp without explaining exactly why
for the love of god people what exactly is it about breach was not related to her blogs or csm5 that you do not understand
well i guess she will have more trouble trying to convince ccp to implement her idea to charge players real life cash the more players they kill in game then damn shame that
i loldibtlif its a nda breach it most likely had something to do with dust514 or incarnawho knows why is this such a big dealalso if ccp wanted this to remain unseen and kept quiet why did they post a news item on the front page of eve for everyone to seeccps waving of the banhammer sposed to be scaryi got no serious feeling out of this bit csm still seems like a big joke to me
i believe you are wrong when they held an election etc they have a moral obligation to do right by it theyve dragged real people into this with real names used them as posterboys and girls to get good press and now they ditch someone just because i as a voter want more details and it is indeed possible to give them if they so choose i can wait a few feew weeks i would also like to know more about how it was handled why didnt she leave quietly etc csm is about transparancy sp and this case is anything butin short internet spaceships is serious business i want answers
have you considered the possibility that her nda breach and subsequent expulsion had nothing to do with the csm
it has to have something to do with the csm because there isnt a nda for anyone else who plays eve afaikif you mean this csm you may be right though
you have repeatedly posted that her ban had nothing to do with her blog post do you know why she was banned because the csm chair said csm wasnt told and if you dont know why she was banned why are you running around telling everyone why she was or was not banned
actually youre oversimplifying the issueit is entirely possible that she got information that had nothing to with what the csm was discussing thus outside the purview of the csm and then acted on that information that would be a breah of the nda yet have nothing to do with her csm duties per seone example saw an emai over the shoulder of some dev i was watching work check out what ccp is doing next dont assume that just because the csms have to sign an nda that her breach of it was because of her official dutiesin fact i am more inclined to believe it wasnt simply because of what happened to lark larks was clearly based on information passed on directly from ccp to the csm based on the details we were provided and both lark and ccp were far more open about itshrugs its a moot point anyway my guess is if ankh comes out and talks about it directly theyll invoke that part of the nda that says they can sue you and ccp obviously isnt going to give so all this discussion is really just us rabbling around
i guess but it depends how you define csm duties to me that would seem to be breaching the csm nda whilst doing csmy things  therefore the breach is about csm stuff im fairly certain though that it is not a larkonisgate style breach though as all the other csm members seem just as confused as us though who knows what theyre really thinking
because 4 other csm members posted the same stuff on blogs and werent reprimanded for it and because none of it was nda sensitive material in the first placeyoure wrong as develdrin nicely illustrated above
because 4 other csm members posted the same stuff on blogs and werent reprimanded for it and because none of it was nda sensitive material in the first placeon the one hand your point is valid but it is still an assumption perhaps ccp is unaware of the other blogs perhaps ccp considers each of them to be a breach but is being selective about enforcement perhaps the problem comes from her work with the reporter last year perhaps it has to do with something several years ago that ccp didnt choose to persue until just now here is my point none of the posters  nor csm  knows for sure why she was sacked if you want to join the speculation thats fine but posting a flat thats not why she was dismissed when you dont know anymore than the rest of us is misleading people who might see your csm tag and think you are speaking from knowledge instead of assumptionim willing to believe ccp that she did something against their nda other than a blog post but i also believe that ccp should inform the csm of more details of what she did ccp unilaterally removing a csm delegate without telling the csm why just reinforces the point that the csm has no power other than what ccp decides to temporarily allocate them and certainly isnt transparent or communicating with the playerbase
youre just looking for a reason so you can say ccp treated her unfairlyif you remember correctly my blog was up long before hers and received quite a bit of attention here and on other boards mynxees is a lot harsher about ccp on certain points so no it had nothing to do with it now let go of the idea
so heres a funny little factankh was booted from csm because she breached the nda in other words revealing information that she was not supposed to reveal another way of putting it is ankh let the cat out of the bagccp does not want to inform us of what excactly it was that she disclosed even though it has already been revealed another way to put it ccp wants to keep the cat that got out of the bag inside the bagone last thought gimme a break the cats out at least tell us where the cat is so we can avoid getting our eyes scratched out because accidently sit on it
implement the shares feature on a bigger scale 1 you can buy shares from all npc corps their prices will fluctuate on a weekly basis based on real eve events simple example if the number of wars increase the rd npc corp will see their shares increase a little bit if eve players buy shares the increase will be greater another exemple if the demands of minerals is greater all npc mining corps will see their shares increase a little bit if players get into it the increase will be better if the number of barges and exhumers kills goes up the shares of npc mining corps will go down those simple events can simulate prices and if enough players buy when the price go down you could actually reverse the tendency so you have a certain control over the trends if you inject enough cash into it 2 when you buy you have to sell since there are many npc corps and the number of eve players buying shares might not be constant you need to sell but to whom  the npc corps would buy back a certain amount of shares daily to simulate a real market 3 of course the solution to all this seems impossible but its not all you need is to run scripts on a dailyweekly basis to get statistics on the eve events those scripts will get answers to determine if prices go up or down per example a script would run to calculate the number of minerals sold per race another to calculate the number caldari ships sold etc since those hundreds of scripts are doing select only they dont need to run on downtime then once a week prices of the shares are update at downtime with the help of the data previously acquired4 youll need to implement a buysell share program like in the real world stop loss orders limit orders etc and graphs of course5 this solution will finally introduce a widespread use of shares that could evolve with popularity if popularity doesnt take it still implements a living share market where you can make a small profit on your investment and theres no chance of anyone robbing you if people get into it you could make bigger and quicker profitsa few more details need to be figured out with a little bit of imagination and math you can go a long way ill leave it to those who are paid to think about this stuff
another thing that would be really cool is if prices were tied to ingame things like how well a faction was doing in faction warfare how many of its npc convoys are getting destroyed or how many missions are being completed for them
that would be pretty awesome i think that taking it one step further would be setting up more incentives for players to report player corp operations so the same sort market statistics could be applied to real corps imagine if say corp war decs another that gets put up somewhere and players could buy shares of who they expect to win sorta deal it would make sense cause if a corp does win then now theyll be able to pay out dividends and shares become worth more from all this market information on player run corps we could see something evolve along the lines of fortune 500 tracking stuffnow that would be cool
i support the idea absolutely but i wonder how it would work i mean most corporations in the real world have obvious roles that they fill and people buying into those companies know what they produce you know lockheed stock is going to be based on aircraft orders and fuel pricesbut corps in eve dont have to disclose what they make so how would you ever know what you are buying into what would profit be based on what would the stock that you are buying represent as far as hard assets go how do you handle fraudim just not sure how you would do this as much as id love to see it
well i think like i said earlier that the key to making that system work would be making an incentive to reporting what your corp is doing a lot like the corps that create ipos that sorta deal except constantly updating
per exemple when you search a corp to join in the recruitement tab you can check several options like pirate mining pve manufacturing ive never been ceo of a corp maybe theres already a checkbox where you set the role of your corp if not it wont be too hard to add this choice
i really really really like the ideamaybe skip the playercorps thing could be too difficult but factors for player corporations could bebigger corp wallet  incomeincrease in members account only ofcmember activitybut i really like the npc corp deal  lets say deep core mining specializes in veldspar while others may specialize in kernite  so if prices to up for veldspar on global market increase in share value for deep core mining for combat npc corps such as spacelane partol the more missions done for them  the higher share value  aracus out
if the market thing is going to work then a corp needs to be able to generate isk from its shares and shareholders need to be able to profit based on increased real value not just a demanddriven price dividend payments should be automated to curtail the most obvious fraudif a traded corp want to have a pr man post reports and such thats fine but any publicly traded corp should have a public walleta read only log of transactions so that prospective investors can see what the corp really doeslimiting the stock market to npc corps would create a ccprun market casino useful only for speculationi would like to see some coupling between news stories and markets if a food shortage is reported then npc buy orders should be present to drive up food prices
good idea supported
supported  i would make it an halfweekly event
i only support this idea so long as the only guy concord can be paid to shoot is jason edwards the only version of your idea that makes good sense is just disolve concord and let players at each others throats everywhere that would be a brave new world but i dont even want to think about how much real life isk ccp would loose if they killed highsec for players of more solitary and passive dispositions think of it this wayall those supercarebears are giving ccp money to do basically nothing that money ccp pumps back into their game thru expansions and into new games like dust it may spoil your fun that you cant isntantly grief everyone in the game all at once with an epic win button but it doesnt bother me so much because eve isnt just a game its a virtual reality
why dont you go gank him yourself instead of getting concord to do it
worst idea everhighering concord which is overpowered and would blob the  outta you and the pilot been paid against carnt do not supported
not supportednot just because its dumb but because its cowardly and dumb
not supported go hire a merc corp they exist for a reason or train for pvp and pop him yourself if hes griefing you that much hes probably flagged hostile meaning you can shoot him legally
the side effects hes got there are just some suggestions nothing that wouldnt need to be consideredtweakedthe idea of an additional ecm bonus booster isnt actually too bad of an idea boosters in general need a good deal of love
bump more discussion is needed on this particular topic
i actually like this idea keep the bonuses relatively low but something akin to the electronic superiority warfare link would be cool boost to ewar strength among the penalties should definitely be ewar range and then others possibly to shield hparmor hpsignature radiusop you should add this in and maybe some of the ecm white knights wouldnt be so mad
pray tell which other ewar requires one to spend half a billion or more and all setimplant slots in order to be a counterimagine if you will if sebos or tcs were more or less useless on anything not bc or bigger thus requiring you to invest 2 months worth of isk just to give them the oomph needed for them to be useful  there is a mindboggling difference between a slot module costing peanuts and implants that vaporize in the first lagspike on shipdestructionop needs to add eccm rigs for all sizes with smalls adding fixed number rather than percentage comparable ecm boosting dope dual nature to eccm dope that adds fixed number or percentagedo this and you might have a case personally not convinced that the ecm turd can be polished into anything worth looking at it has to be redesigned entirely if there is to be any hope of it being remotely close to balanced with other ewar types
one difference between the caldari recons and the other races is thiscaldari has all bonuses going towards one module while gallante minmitar and amarr are split between two different onesfitting both module types to get the full bonuses is simply not a realistic option for any size fleetsso while caldari can fit their one module gets full bonuses the rest are stuck with half the bonuses
adding eccm rigs is an interesting idea but i dont think its quite the best solution to help solo pilots and more of a general nerf to ecm eccm rigs are the sort of thing you might see en masse in large fleets as a standard fitting especially on sniper bs and i dont think thats a good thing the booster idea is specifically designed to make it targeted towards solosmall gang implementationi dont think your suggestion for a fixed bonus really works either i like that its an out of the box suggestion a bit but why exactly should small ships get a disproportionate eccm boost as a solo pilot who regularly flys small ships i think its perfectly fine that that are proportionally easier to jam than larger ones if in fact small ships are going to get more protection from ecm couldnt that just be done by a straight up higher sensor strength on the hulls
what he saidwellat least with dust514 there will be k00l d00ds shooting each other for control over planet resources no one wants to harvest anyway so thats a new feature were all gonna love
i think that is the problem ccp is facing which is why we got a free ship which is why they are actually saying they are looking into fixing pi there isnt a mass interest in pi people arent clamoring for their own part of a planet so adding dust514 is going to be adding a huge supply of planet takers and there isnt a demand for themin any event i do support ccp putting off incarnadustetc to fix up some of the current problems in eve
i concur
or just fit rails and still kill them quicker than a mwd  blaster setup because you didnt have to fly anywhere to get in range
and please tell me why do gallente have to be robbed of using their main weapon system
even if fitting blasters for l4 is completely pointlessand yes i did a blockade with working mwd in my gank mega while waiting for a raven to log back in i would like missions that allow the use of the mwd for other reasons
you have no clue how much more fun missions can be when you dont sit around all the time but actually have to do some flying thats why all my mission boats are fitted with short range weapons now
doing l4 with a range extended puls abaddon or ak pest is fun and effective doing it with a blaster mega is just boring and ineffective
honestly think the blasters should be revamped they should get the falloff boost similar to minmatar weaponrykronos should have a falloff bonus instead of the stasis webifier velocity bonus with aformention native blaster falloff increase and kronos bonused falloff increase it would be more in line with the vargur golem and paladin thenkronos with blasters is about useless at this point because of blasters horribly limited rangevargur is top killer when it comes to level 4 missions being able to kill favourite missions like blockade or pirate invasion in only one cycle of bounty long range fitted marauders would have trouble being this efficientthe maelstrom is also on the top of the board for efficiency of mission running because of the recent boost to minmatar weaponsthis boost to matar weapons brought them inline with caldari and amarr ships of the same general fitting idea medium range gank and tank perfect for mission runninggallente needs the same lovethe only reason i would ask for microwarp in missions is so i dont have to fly a special fitting to gank someone in lowsec who is in a deadspace complexmissiontldr  fix blaster falloff close range guns on slow as hell armor tanked ships bogglethread
while i would love autocanonclass faloff on my blasterships that would make blasters better autocanons that consume cap and that we probably dont whant or so i think
the only other way to compensate is by making gallente ships faster they lost the brute force of blaster dps when they lost a significant amount of their speedthis is why people who dont know any better still fly the skirmish fit diemosim not saying make them like autocannons but i am saying they do need and increase in range ever since the speed nerfa kronos with null hitting at 55km instead of 33km for 50 of its maximum dps would be siffucient id saycurrently a vargur will hit 50 of its maximum dps somewhere around 95km with 800mm and barrage
i would support this as i too find it really annoying and i only have 6 extractors atm
then you are gonna go crazyi support
i defentiv support this because its a waste of time and a pretty boringneedlessfeature which turns my interest in planetary interaction into a terrible click fest i will stay away in futurea solution would be grouping extractors based on first steps into using npcs to do itlike mining teams in diffrent qualitys which bonus is  as better they are as more extractors they can combineprobally some lower skills in social interaction as an improvment to planetary interactionit would make things muche asier and hopefully interestingmy 2 centsbreg mac
if you cant manage a colony then dont do pi out of all the industry professions this is the easiest time youll be making money ccp gave you a way to make isk out of thin air all you have to do is click a couple extractors
i can make money out of trading just the same way with less clicking out of thin air this is not an argument i make money out of thin air while missioning in my domi i only have to click ctrlf1 ctrlf2 ctrlf3 for my tank and rightclick launch drones then i can go have a nap same argument more money less clicking
sorry but you cant compare pi that requires very little initial investment or maintnance to trade you also cant compare it to mission running either since it doesnt require constant attention mission running doesnt produce you profit 247 either and requires alot more sp and investment into ships ammunition etcedit my point is pi requires you to put only slight amount of money into it and itll return you back 10 times more each day untill the hell freezes over its far from comparable to any other form of making money
a bit less clicks to safe time for other things thats allpos fuel materials producers will love itif the possibillity would cost a bit skilling time u have nothing to loose
look things like manufacturing invention research they all require investment that with work will slowly start chuckling out some profit in pi you invest in a cc and installations and get your resaults right away or perhaps with a slight delay when processed further beside this things like mission running require attention and time you have to include time into your profit calculations whatever youre doing running missions ratting or exploring exactly the same considerations go into pi its up to you if you want to spend time setting things up more often to get more profit or you cant really be bothered so you get a low incomei dont understand why would pi ever require even more perks then it currently has
you dont have to click a couple extractors you have to do thousands of clicks per extractor  for millions of extractorsand now vote this proposal up please you will love it too
but you can compare it to rd agents a few clicks maybe 15 minutes of hauling per month and you can pull in a load of isk pi needs to be less clickintensive
pos gunning needs a slight updateallow alliance members to be pos gunners in poss that dont belong to their corp this would aid a lot in strategic objectives for alliancesfairly simple proposition cant take longer than 5 minutes to implementthanks
10
forgot to support it
consider the following scenarioi you have jump bridge at deathstar posii you jump around freighters and other easy to kill with pos guns shipsiii you have no information that the sitting in the pos alliance member is a spyiv spy sacrifices this char identity and kills your or your friends valued ships by scrambling and killing them with possibly your own pos gunsprofithaving starbase defense management at iv costs about 1084784 skill pointsi do not support this
fealy seems you dont know pos gunning mechanicsyou still need posgunner rights to be able to use the guns if your really that bothered to kill the freighter you can join the other corp and get pos gunning rights
doesnt that make it way easier for spies to obtain gunner rights than ever before
spies are your own problems let us choose
yeah spies are not an ingame mechanic metagaming should not prevent benefits ingame
it should be a toggle on the towers defence settings
yes its one of these threads again here goes nothingi see the main issue of lowsec is its riskreward ratio hisec has almost no risk and little reward 00 has huge risks and huge rewards lowsec has almost the same risk as 00 but crap rewards wh space is basically 00 with less riskhisec level 4 missions with some lp and loot crap ores crap pi crap complexes crap belt ratslowsec level 45 missions with more loot and lp than hisec crap ores a bit better pi a bit better complexes a bit better belt rats00 level 45 missions with loads of loot and lps abc ores great pi amazing complexes mostly bs belt ratsas you can see the rewards do go up linearly but since the risk in lowsec is almost the same as in 00 the main difference is that you cant cyno jam a system claim sovereignty or put up bubblestherefore lowsec isnt really worth living in except for pvpwhat i think should be done is the following just make it 00 and hisec not this fail lowsec nonsense not literally but bear with me1 improve lowsec belts yet again make it so that even 04 spawns bs rats all the time just make the bs worth 500800k isk max triple 200300k isk bc spawns would do too they do spawn currently but only occasionaly and in 03 sec2 improve the belts add abc ores to all 04 systems so 03 and lower we might actually see miners move into lowsec more if the rewards are worth the risk more miners  more targets for pirates3 increase pi resources a bit more in lowsec4 optionally increase the quality of complexes in lowsec5 i think a good idea would be to remove security status loss in lowsec and keep it only in 05 and higher why when you pass through a lowsec gate the first time you do get a warning window if you agree with the text you agree with nonconsensual pvp so why should lowsec pvpers get 10 for fighting there if fighting is not really forbidden therei still think security status losses should be kept for hisec suicide gankers and so on but not in lowsec if concord cant be arsed to avenge you it shouldnt be arsed to punish the aggressors
if you kill somebody and they dont catch you it does not mean that you are innocent yes to everything except for sec status otherwise you turn lowsec into 00
sovnull alliances will move in drive pirates away shut down the systems from everyone else and farm it if rewards are too high boosting rewards was never a viable solution because of this the only direction left to go is decrease risksovnull is not huge rewards huge risk its huge rewards no risk you can go on for weeks on end in some of those backwater sovnull systems without seeing a single hostile in highsec idiots suicide gank you youre more likely to get killed there than in some sovnull backwater systemsbefore mission scanning mission running carebears were in lowsec then it got implemented and they left you can come with whatever fixes you want in the end only one will work lowsec werent always broken there was a time when its not we already know what worked in the past all thats left is bringing it back
yes security status thingy is optional as i said but really hisec  concord  security hits lowsec 00  no concord  no security hits would make more sense to me at leasteven if 00 powerblocks try to move into lowsec they still wont be able to bubble gates and defend cap ship attacks so while they may move in people can still go through their camps easily making holding large areas of lowsec a lot harder than holding the same amount of 00 systemsand i agree that in some cases 00 is safer than hisec just getting to the safe places is a bit risky whereas in hisec you can be suicide ganked but only if youre an idiot 300m in a t1 hauler faction fit active tanked hulk officer fit missioning ship etc
mmm on the right track but i think you also miss what a gem low sec really is what i would like to see is a small but noticeable boost give it better belt rats 04 should spawn atleast 65k isk cruisers in the initial spawn instead of 12k isk dessies and work up from theremissions should be given a greater reward boost id favor an automatic 100 pay increase for the fact that its in low sec this is in addition to the normal security effects i think low sec ores are mostly fine only bots mine anyways whether those bots are in highlownull sec sec doesnt really matterlow sec anomalies could use a boost too there really only seems to be 3 types of anomalies when you get right down to it high sec that can be solod with a rookie ship low sec that can be done in a t1 fitted cruiser and null sec that requires a carrier to solo there is room for a few additional levels in there i think and they all belong in low sec principally the actual plexs that require probing are generally well balanced i thinklow sec needs to remain sufficiently poor to keep its lawless no mans land status so it cant be boosted to much but a little love is a good thing i also agree that probing ships needs to be more difficult so ill throw my request to have deviation tripled and combat probe strength halved once again stationgate guns could also use a bit of a boost too maybe double the damage on them
low sec isnt broken nor is 00 although instant always reliable local chat is way overpoweredhigh sec is the area thats broken as far as risk vs reward goeswhile im not against boosting lowsec i think it is a false pretense to say low sec needs boosting and not to just say that high sec rewards need nerfing
ahh i agree 00 and lowsec would be fine if there were only lvl 1 and 2 missions in hisec but we all know how all the carebears are going to whine if lvl4s get removed from hisec we also know it will never happen ever ccp likes their rl isk too much to basically lose 100k subscriptions ok even if its 10k a lot of people i mean pinatas would stop playingrothgar i agree with everything except the probing changes either make missions unprobable or dont mess with stuff that isnt broken probing tears in hiseclowsec00wh is already a bore and it would take 6x as long as it takes now to probe someone although i would agree with a lowseconly probe nerf say the pirate factions are using probe jammers or something all over lowsec and optionally npc 00 which lowers your chances of probing someone out significantly or something i guess that could bring some of the pinatas into lowsecabout the ores there a a lot of mining corps out there none mine in lowsec either hisec or 00wh space and this is why you may not be an ore expert but its obvious that there are only two types of ore the 300 isk per m3 and the 70100 isk per m3 the figures there are not exact but generally lowsec ores are only marginally better than hisec ores and mining them in lowsec is stupid  risk is too high for a very small increase in reward we might see an increase in lowsec mining ops bringing more pvp and life into lowsec if abc ores were added to all lowsec belts obviously in smaller quantities than in 00i agree that mining is for bots but i also know there are a lot of living breathing miners out there and they would benefit greatly from this  and so would piwates 
self destructing is a pretty lame way to avoid getting killmailsis there anyway the system can be changed so that a killmail is generated to the top damage dealer when a enemy self destructshad a enemy self destruct 2 carriers yesterday just to avoid getting lossmails seems like a pretty pathetic way of doing thingsif someone self destructs without anything shooting at them the current system is fine i just think it should be changed however when a fight has been going onany thoughts
this has been discussed by csm4 already and was approved
makes perfect sense to me
approved and supported killmails do not enhance my egenitals enough we need more ways to make epeens grow bigger
dont panic
supported for the lolz
if i had a towel im sure someone would give me a  that i misplaced
oh yea
i definitely need 42 towels in my hangarccp needs to do this
i dont know how many of you have noticed but blizzard is apparently going to require posters on their forums to use their real names
hehe i think they are already regretting that idea one of their employees posted his real name to show it isnt that bad people started collecting and posting all available about him he needs a new phone number and twitter account now payback is a btch
highly supportedi also compliment the ccp staff on their effectiveness of the moderation of the eve forumsha where the hell did this happen
fun starts at posting 16
seriously this would kill plenty of markets some people have a side business of moving skillbooks to 00 with the inherent risks and inherent rewards now people would just clonejump to empire once a year or so and inject one year worth of skills prerequisite known or notthis is removing some player interaction for the sake of a very small convenience the revised proposal alleviates it a bit but tbh i prefer the system as it is
supported
definitely supported
supportedthis would be convenient but then again i found this in the meeting minutes for september 2009
pls pls pls make this happen
supportedmainly because i hate keeping track of all the skill books i cant train yet
not drone drones but lets say im flying a mega i have my defense drone in my cargobay i jump into a camp i eject and anchor it it then will shoot down and stop all damage happening to you until there is no energy left this works only if it is able to intercept the attacks so more antilong range sort of attacks drones and short range weapons would still be hitting the target similarly this would be how you destroy the enemy
come on man this is a pretty weak attempt normally your posts at least manage to present the bad idea youre proposing in a coherent fashion that could possibly make a couple people think that it might be good this is just nonsense in the most literal meaning of the word
sorry was typing it at work and had a couple interruptions ill try to be more coherent with my awesome ideas
36 month ban must have been lifted
i havent ever been banned i just finished last year of school got my degree with top marks and now working so the mmog of real life is keeping me very busy tourny got me back into the game and thusly back to posting my great ideas
lets see there are currently 183 pages of proposals in here requests for changes to be made to the game suggestions for fixes some a very good and make a good deal of sense some are so so and would benefit one group at the expense of another some are just downright stupid and provide us with a good laughbut of all these 183 pages of proposals  not one has been discussed at the csm and then been implemented by ccp not oneso why are we bothering to continue with the charade of the csmi formally call for it to be disbanded not that it will happen as hey nothing else in here ever has
yes i am sure the csm will get right around proposing this to ccp nice troll bro
incredible if you put up the minimal effort of looking up previous meeting minutes or the wiki pages it should be abundantly clear that a lot of issues including those most heavily requested have indeed been discussed by the respective csm and also brought to ccps attentionas for the end of that quote well if ccp has not bothered to allocate resources to solving these issues or implementing these proposals then the csm is hardly at fault on the contrary their effort to at least try to get ccp to commit should be commendednot signed obviously
the key problem is that people who think the csm is ineffective and should be disbanded arent reading this forum im only reading it because of the recent drama but hey if ccp wants to provide airfare for a bunch of players then ignore them for the next year thats their business
upon reading your proposal one could say that the csm is working as planned by ccp more facts would help your case such as cost vs benefit of the csm and i must also say that upon reading the minutes of some of the previous incarnations of the csm some of the proposals in this forum have been discussed and put to ccp both in the online meetings and on the iceland tripexample fw bugs and developmentlinkagerelevant threadslinkagelinkageyou can access the relevant threads for the other issues in these minutes from the post itself what does disappoint me is that such comprehensive minutes do not seem to be posted by the current csm i assume that to much of their energies have been directed towards infightingnow i am tired having exhausted my small reservoir of can give a damn and must bid you good day
the problem is not csm but ccp that have no resources to make any changesdust is more importent
lets seeyou think the csm has accomplished nothing in terms of having proposals discussed and reviewed so your idea is to propose that the csm is disbanded but if no proposals are ever followed through how do you expect this proposal to follow through quite the cunundrum
meh most of csm guys are null alliance farmers blobers and killmail humpers that are out of touch with the highlow sec dwelling majority some of their proposals may do more harm than good not that ccp will ever implement themsupported csm is just a scapegoat for ccp to placate the masses and avoid criticism themselves to give the illusion that something is in the works when nothing is if its dissolved the additional petitions and bug reports may suck up enough resources that ccp may deem it worthy to actually do something
which members are they
naming names and flaming flame not gonna bite i can say ankhesentapemkah isnt among them but he got the boot so thats a moot point rest you can pretty much tell from corps and alliances theyre in
i wish my world was as simple as yours
youre all bluster and no balls arent you
yes it is funnily enough  and also quite the illustration as to why the whole concept of the csm is a just a crock of smelly brown stuffi also notice that one of the  ahem  illustrious chosen few deigns not to offer a valid rebuttal but just trots out the standard line wonder if he has been promised a super cap reimbursement for his alliances next loss
good small changes the idea that fixing a whole bunch of small simple things would go a long way toward making the ui far less irritating and easier to use was mentioned by csm at the june 2010 summit if we ever get the promised list of csmraised issues in the backlog and their status maybe well know where some of the ui proposals that csm has raised stand in the development plan
i support it
i like this idea looks nice
i dont like this idea i dont see anyway to make it good either except to say its just bad many people have given good reasons as to why its bad but heres an idea join an alliance and raise the cost of the wardec considerably if they really want to wardec your alliance they will heres another idea beg for mercy pay them the isk as a sign of surrender and actually surrender to the wardec basically current game mechanics already allow you to counterbid the war by pleading for peace will doing so entertain your enemies probably but if youre outgunned the options you have are 1make a stand and get blown up 2hide in stations 3run to the otherside of the unvierse 4cloakup 5pay for mercenaries to fight withor for you 6diplo the other corp for terms of surrender 7close your corp form a new one 8join an alliance to make war against you more costly over all theres so many evasive options that waging an effective war against another corp is pretty challenging as it is so i absolutely do not support this idea
25 mil for alliance dec is nothing joining mid dec will just give the deccer more targets for even less isk join an alliance in itself does not helpif you pay anything to anyone youll have an endless stream of decs from others who want to get paid it make things worse1get blown up attract kb padders youll end up with endless stream of decs2hide in station denies your access to game while still paying monthly subscription you may as well cancel your subscription3leaving everything behind and running denies your access to game highsec isnt large they may chase after you pos cant run4cant do anything when cloaked denies access to game may as well unsubscribe5paying mercs dont cancel out current wardec your hulk cant fight6terms are isk or popping certain number of ships for kb padding both of which attract endless wardecs7killing the patient is not a cure8again 25mil is still chump changeyouve just illustrated everything thats broken about current wardec mechanicsccp should never have lowered highsec wardec costs its too easily exploited and need to be reversed
yes
ok so i know this is pretty much flogging a dead horse here buti have put a lot of time in thinking about how to properly allowsuper capital ships to dock so before you go screaming no readthis and youll understand why ive set it up like this so thereis no docking games with super capitals1first off it has to be a system with the super capital upgrades2players must train a skill called adv docking3must have fitted docking computer on ship this module can not beremoved while docked in the stationadv breakdown of requirements1 is a giving the system must have this upgrade2 this skill should be a 14x multiplier just like all the other skills and should follow theselinesprimary skills requireddisc skill at using advance docking computers and their understanding12 seconds reduction per a level of advance docking computeradvanced space ship command vcapital ship iv3 this is a mid slot module that must be fitted before docking begins and is requiredto stay on the ship the whole time the ship is dockeditem breakdown advanced docking computerdisc due to the enormous size of super capital ships concord outlawed the attempts ofdocking these massive ship to all capsuleer many corporations within new eden have beenworking on ways to dock these ship to everyones amazement ore came forth with an advanceddocking computer capable of the precision maneuvers neededactivation time 120 secondscool down time 3600 secondscool down doesnt start till ship is in spacewhile docking computers are fitted ships can not be tradedfittingsmid slotcpu 650power grid 250000can only be fitted on super carriers titans5000 m3seeing a 60 minute cool shouldnt allow these ships to play docking games or remove themodule till the cool down time is overif you notice they will have to off line some mods to fit the computerthis wouldnt remove the fact youll need pos or another capital ship to refit atso due to the heavy draw back of using docking computers i dont see this having super capitalsover powered due to the fact the can dock well still need super cap arries to build themhaving to have the module fitted will keep them from being built and trade
please do not cross post you have an identical thread in features  ideasi will lock this thread however if you would prefer this one to remain open then post in the thread in fi and i shall lock that one instead
looks very nice would be a great featuresupported
station containers have the option to lock and unlock them with or without password which is great but i use eve on a laptop and my pc indoors wwhenever i log into the laptop all the station containers become locked even if i have them set with no password and had it all unlocked on my pc so i unlock them all again then i get home log back in to my pc and its all locked up again can it be fixed so that once you have chosen an option to lock or unlock and container with or without a password it is remembered by the game as it is really annoying having to continuly unlock containers also why cant we drag and drop on a container in station you have to open the container and then drag to the tab if stacked is there any support to my request your thoughts please
not supported  it would make logistics and taking space hell
cool i wouldnt get bombed so easily in a bs fleet oh wait
not supportedwould kill off any remaining hopes of roaming pvp gangs most of 00 is empty so having more time to engage with locals is a moot point

your writing isnt bad the concepts youve inplaced are fully noted theres just a disagreement about risk here both our stances would allow the player to partake in buffed varied playstyles yes but what your side does is tantamout to making extra module slots for your ship basically you dock up hotswap and leave with better abilites for the intended situation thats no different from the current ship fitting and does not bring anything new in terms of strategynow if you have the set racks implanted in your pod forever than you can employ new tactics on the strong and weakpoints of your clones this would add customization to the clones themselves on a more intuitive level in your case you could decide to have a scanner clone that has amazing scanning bonuses but generic sets for everything else so ultimately the risk applied is still up to you to have an omni clone that has access to multiple high end implant sets without the trade off of either decreased profficiency or increased liability does not follow the intended mechanics of the implant and subverts its purpose of being a static customization much like riggings are for ships the system youve came up with just makes implants another interchangable mod which in this case is too powerful to be utilized on such a level for instance in a game of cards you sometimes trade in your weak ones thats not the way eve plays it you have one hand dealt and when the flop comes you either sink or swim thats the way it is when you have cheaters that hide cards up their sleeves it ruins the unpredicatable essence of the game now imagine if everyone did that wheres does the actual skill come into playi feel your idea would make the game overly rely on buffs instead of strategy we already have enough buff options for pilots imo that is why i cannot support your idea as it is now
well its good to hear that you have an idea but it would be nice if you wrote something about what you think would be the advantages with your system compared to what we got nowsecond its not entirely clear if you want all attributes to generate sp simultaneously or if you have to choose some of the attributes i can see some trouble with having all attributes generating spthird i dont see how this system of your is in any conflict with learning skills you say sp generation will depend on the attributes and learning skills increases your attributes so where is the conflict
the advantages is that you can go on vacation for 2 weeks and not have to log on a computer you get skill points in each attributes automatically you decide to purchase your skills when you want so youre not tied to the computer like we are nowyes i see you point ive just realized it that could simply be corrected by selecting your combo of learning youll get a choice the first time you log and you can change it at will still you wont be tied to your computer perception willpowerx intel  memory memory  intel charisma  willpowerits in conflict because if you log the first time decide to learn skillspoints in the intelmemory attributes for 4 weeks then decide after 4 weeks you buy learning skills it will affect your sphour only 4 weeks later but it wont be retroactive with the current system so you have a waste unless you implement some math for those specific skills
supported in principle but needs refinement most especially we definitely dont want any implementation to be unbalanceditd be neat if we could try out being concord lawmen
1 improve the ui for the buy  sell orders in the wallet just like the places in people  places we should be able to see how many jumps away we are from the orders in which region and constellation is the order all that with a order by ascdesc on each fields the main advantage is that while youre traveling through many systems you can see right away which orders you can update right now if you have 50 orders spread across many regions you have to check the orders one by one to make sure its within your grasp you could also display the orders with a green highlight if its in the same region that you are and within your influence depends on the trading skills2 display the tech lvl of all items when in list mode per exemple after i run a few lvl 4 i have hundreds of items then i proceed to check all of them one by one to find the ones worth selling i end up doing hundreds of query to the server only to find out the tech lvl of the item once i found what i like i still do many queries to find out the prices of those items simply inefficient adding the tech lvl in list mode would save server time and cut the trouble in half3 in corporate information  agents add the number of jumps away and quality of agents in seperate fields then add the order by ascdesc on each field it will be easier to find nearby quality agents also apply the same principle in people  places  agents tabyou should add a new button in the taskbar one that would show all available agents with their quality and lvl in the system with a dock link it will be easier to get to the agent you want when there are many stations from the same corp in the system going through the corp information is too slow4 make the calculator bigger or at least give us the option to make it bigger bigger numbers too
the whole csm is run by blocvoted candidates thing is simply a myth though id like to see how you propose to ban itif you look at csm5 youll see only 2 of the 9 main delegates who could even be classed as large alliance bloc voted candidates there were a few more large alliance candidates who didnt even make it to alternate status hardly a controlling interest
a pity the next csm is so long awayi think i may put myself forward as a candidate next timeto the trolls if you have a comment make it ontopic at the very leastyes i will argue any point with anyone im not biased
yes you are and your dishonesty is beneath you no matter what facts were brought up that showed anks character you handwaved them away quotes that kept their meaning precisely didnt count because they were out of context except all those that were checked meant the exact same thing in context as they appeared to from a quote and coincidentally that was the time that you kept claiming that everything was untrue and out of context but refused to cite a single other instance of such redeeming context just like you claimed that all the facts about here were debunked but have never provided a citation of that either just like all the facts about ank were smears but you never could show that they werent factual just like all the people who posted about ank were trolls even though they were posting their honest opinions about facts you dishonestly claimed were wrongjust like you spared a throaway sentence to talk about how ank should be kicked off the csm if it was true she threw something at another csm member at the summit funny you somehow didnt run with that demand but then for post after post tried to take sok to task for daring to report the facts facts are smears war is peace ank is cool just like now youre playing schoolmarm and trying to lecture csm members that theyre not allowed to talk poorly about a disgraced and terminated excsm member who was removed for misconduct you have relentlessly supported ank at every turn with dishonesty reliably of course youre one of her partisansfunny that being a partisan for someone who isnt a politician anymore
it really doesnt matter two s about who you voted for ccp cant just dump a playerelected csm member without giving a reason when so many players vote for them they could at least give a reason without going into details whatthechristplease do not evade the profanity filter zymurgist
i dont post rumors about features thats what fallouts words pertain to linking to a random post from a dev doesnt lend credence to your argument btwand im sorry but im entitled to an opinion about my fellow members and how easyhard they are to work with my personal experience is what it has been and i think people deserve to know it im not a big fan of sugarcoating things for political correctness sorry if you dont like what i said youre entitled to an opinion tooi didnt like ankhe and im happy to see her go because she has historically been impossible to work with though in all fairness it was better during this csm summit than i expected but only because i interacted with her only when she said patently untrue things i dont do ad hominem attacks when dealing with proposals she doesdid and people deserve to know this too mynxee is entitled to an opinion about things thats her prerogative and i usually agree with her however her scolding wasnt about what i said but about the fact that i said it giving free fodder to forum trolls whatever as can be clearly seen i had redacted my post and decided to let the matter rest obviously you dont but i wont comment on it any furtheri dont do speculation either whatever you may think and always preface opinionsthoughts clearly as such hence the thats my opinion in the post you quotedas far as this thing goes any nda breach is really detrimental for the whole process and the trust ccp can expect to have in csm members in that regard im effing annoyed to put in a way milder word that wont trigger the forum censor thing about what her stupid behavior may do to our ability to get stuff done in that regard good riddancethe people currently sitting on the csm have varied background and opinions but are able to work through their differences or agree to disagree to get stuff accomplished things just got easier in that regard
1 yes they can they really really can the csm has exactly as much power and position as ccp says they do if the csm wants to be stakeholders in more than name they need to push for it and the community needs to get behind them hopefully now that ank is gone the csm can get down to business 2 they did give a reason without going into details ank violated the nda and was removed for misconduct we may get some good popcorn out of this if she sues for libel but even she should realize that getting her name in the papers for accusations of violating an nda for a software company is career suicide to be fair she also was thinking of suing the eve tribune for libel too so who knows
tossing off commnents like the one about socalled bloc voting needing to be banned but then refusing to explain further when asked amounts to you being the troll deary
let us count the current controversial topics we have shall we1 pl hacking the game so they dont appear in local and also using said hacking program to have the perfect counter in every match to win the at82 nc loses crap ton of super capitals then they magically get ghost ships right after dt to replace them3 ccp claims they do not interfere with with fleet fights then later takes away a ghost titan that white noise probed out before nc could and gives it to nc4 csm member breaks nda by  and no information is given out5 gaming websites and magazines are starting to take notice again not in a good way eithernot sure about the rest of you guys but more bad press in the likes of the t20 thing is not going to help this gameevery csm election i have genuine hopes that it will be the first csm to actually accomplish something only to have my hopes dashed sooner and soonerit wont be long now and it will be the day after elections in which the csm proves the rest of the eve community that it is in fact a jokeeveonline corrupt nah what would make you think that
icelandnuff said
wow what an unfortunate position for ccp to find itself you might recall the csm was created as a direct response to the discovery that one or more ccp devs were directly interfering in the game and giving goodies info etc to their favored alliance bob because the csm was supposed to represent the players interest in the eternal and everpresent playerdev struggle they were to be elected democratically by popular voteankh was duly elected receiving the second most votes of all candidatesnow the second most popular by definition csm member has been removed by ccp with nary a detail other than an indiscriminate statement about nda violations im willing to give ccp the benefit of the doubt on this and i will assume for now that ankh did in fact somehow violate the nda ccp deserves that muchbut ccp has a real problem here and shoudl strongly consider setting aside thier right to lay down the law which is their right and provie more details  perhaps even a joint statement that acknowledges that what ankh did was wrong if she refuses id like to see at a minimum details provided to the csm and some sort of position from them on whether they agree that she did in fact violate teh ndaif she did she should be booted but asking the community to just trust us when the action is to kick out a member of the organization that was esatblished in direct response to ccps own devs cheating  it just smells bad
meiss your last post admirably demonstrates speculation and ad hominien arguments you are as ignorant as the rest of us as to anks dismissal from the csm you cant seem to stop publicly sharing your dislike of her and considering this is a matter that will arguably have a negative impact on the eve community i think it reasonable to call this trolling you certainly do have a right to your views yet a bit of judgment on when and how to express them is in order mynxee and dierdra and others are working hard to make the csm work if only out of professional respect for them please stop delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
ouch i see what you mean it was only later that i learned what a massive blast pvp in eve is and today im simply impressed at the inventive  that people come up with to stuff like the old fleet up a war target in warp and at the stupidly expensive stuff that people fly in pvepersonally i think ccp should really push things like rvb etc so as to get people used to the idea that it is after all just a pixel spaceship game and enjoy the pvp aspect more ive never been in rvb but i suspect that they do more positive stuff for getting people into pvp than any of ccps nerfsbuffs and other weird decisions doremoved a trolling comment and profanity filter  adida
the whole csm is a charade ank getting thrown out because she released quotes from the game producers which confirm that they arent taking the csm serious but just do their own agenda and then consulting the csmsure minor things which ccp anyway wanted to implement are credited to the csm but the real deal those things which the players now for years demand not going to happen  not enough devs for that the producer say at least according to ank i have no doubt to not believe that because it also fits to the things we can see and for writing that she got thrown outpoor
when the last csm member was removed ccp were a hell of a lot more specificif shes messed up  ccp need to tell people why so they can make more informed choices in the future especially since ccp allows expelled csm members to run again
so the csm was setup to reduce complaints and take pressure off the support teamit has worked very well for that especially during poor expansions when complaints spikenow that the csm has actually grown into the vehicle for the mounting complaints from the playerbase they try to silence itis today the day eve online died forever
apparently ankh will be posting an update on her blog sometime tomorrow now whether or not the information provided will be 100 accurate and balanced remains to be seen im not holding my breath though
a positive contribution and a good course of action thank you thrasymachus delilahps great name
sooo true sad but trueall the meanwhile theyre trying to tell you about the next great new thing theyre going to release brokenie walking in stations
why would they do this if ccp decides to prepare an official statement and divulge exactly what ankh did wouldnt they inturn release the information which caused ankh to get canned in the first place as the news bit says this is a matter regarding confidential data so i wouldnt hold your breath for an official release of what exactly occurred the explanation they gave was enough
lark also resigned and admitted what he did ank is denying it and has threatened legal action before when dealing with such people its not in ccps best interest to share any more info than necessary possible ankalt but there are much more likely contenders of course because it was an opinion on the forums and it results in nothing more than any other opinion on the forum but it happens to suggest that maybe ank shouldnt be removed from the csm gee i couldnt have predicted youd try to support it with some dishonest nonsense about how this opinion is positive or constructive as opposed to all those other views you dont agree with fancy that
lol you thank others when they make good faith contributions something my professors taught me but sorry no ank here delilahremoved a deleted quote  adida
yeh i know haha dont get me wrong being polite is nice its a good thing to be but thanking people so much when they arent doing this specifically for you makes it seem like youre trying to gravitate yourself toward the center of attention whether you mean it or not it comes across as arogant to a lot of peoplethe eve community is already an easily riled bunch so just be a little more mindful they are here to discuss with each other including you not just to provide points foragainst your own ideas and merits 
aye but if i were to pipe up and say that ankh seems to me to have been an epic rl troll you would hardly thank me for a good faith contributionliang
does this count as being fired on her resume
yea but it probably wont appear on the resume
threatened legal action  if she has in fact threatened  is a strawman what are her damages she has no lawsuit  as for what is in ccps best interest  i strongly disagree that it is in ccps best interest to let this sit as is just read this thread ccps best interest is to get 3rd party legitimization of their actions if they cant publically disclose all the details which is a reasonable hypothesis then at a minimum they should disclose it all the the csm so that they can confirm the propriety of ccps actions after all the csm already knows whatever supersecret info is at issue since ankh learned it as a csmnothing about my post suggests that maybe ank shouldnt be removed to the contrary  i specifically said expressly numerous times if she broke the nda she should be canned the problem here is one of trust and legitimacy ccp wants us to just trust them  that she did in fact break the nda i find that ironic when the purpose of the csm was to police ccp for proven violations of game rules if ankh broke the rules  and i specifically said i give ccp the benefit of the doubt that she did  ccp should still do more than just say its between us and her and shes gone they should seek and obtain neutral confirmation its kind of a basic tenet wrapped up in the concept of justice  the accuser should not also be the judgeremoved a personal attack  adida
no its not a strawman she really has threatened legal action in the past and whether or not a lawsuit has merit doesnt mean that it cant be a  and a half to deal with it in court crazy people file stupid lawsuits each and every single day all over the world and no this thread is not a valid sample from which to draw sound conclusions in any case ccp has removed a playerelected virtually powerless spoekeswoman for their internet spaceship game cries of grr ccp must do thus and such arent going to have a lot of weight especially since theres no upside for ccp to drag this headache out and then get the csm involved in determining whether or not it was a breach or what have you not only is that more drama than theyd want but that isnt the csms function they do not set ccp corporate policy enforce ccp corporate policy determine ccp corporate policy interpret ccp corporate policy etc so when the question is whether or not ank violated ccps corporate policy involving the csm doesnt make sense you stated and have repeatedthat the csm should be allowed to view the evidence and judge whether or not it was an nda violation obviously if they find it wasnt an nda violation then itd be a bit odd for ank to be dismissed due to an nda violation this means that maybe ank shouldnt be removed unless youre saying that the csm should be able to view the evidence and if they still say that it wasnt an nda violation then ank should still be removed for an nda violation which is weird if youre not saying that then yah youre saying that maybe ank shouldnt be removed corporations do not require judges or neutral parties millions of people are hired and fired each and every single year without recourse to neutral parties or the legal system
that doesnt seem terribly likely  there are many ways to get information without others in your group getting this information and furthermore its entirely possible that the others know the information that is confidential and dont actually know what she said that got her in troublewhat we actually know is that a subset of the potential information she could have obtained was seen by other members of the csm we further can rule out any information that was posted in her blog and another blog seeing as how most people are saying that it was all echoed pretty well i think we can fairly safely say that it wasnt the blog that got her in troublebut but the blog isnt the only way to communicate ankh could have sent more andor different information along to a third party like another game company or gaming magazineim not sure that ccp can release the details of what she disclosed without opening themselves up to a lawsuit from her if i were in their legal situation id talk to a lawyer before i started taking advice from the game community on what must be donesorry but 500 people quitting over a terse message saying ankh broke nda and got the boot is much less than hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawsuit damages and legal costsliang
in response to finnagainreread my first post and try to do so fairlyi expressly recognized and stated that ccp has the power to do as they please this isnt about what ccp can or cannot dothis is about what ccp should doif you are content having ccp accuse a csm of a breach of policy and simply dismissing that csm rep with no 3rd party review at all  then fine thats your rightbut dont come complaining and asking for verification when its someone you like or support who gets booted with nothing more than the rules were broken its between us we arent saying anything more about it if you fail to see the unfairness of this  theres not much else i can say id suggest however that you are being motivated by your dislike of ankh and not by any sense of fairnessappropriatenesspersonally i know very little about ankh  i voted for her only to lol at her critics because i read a few attacks on her from eve tribune and on the forums and lookeda t what ankh had actually said and it was clear that her critics were misstating her positions and misquoting her in an attempt to drum up antisupport im fine wiht disagreeing wiht her positions but the attacks on her were not fair evaluations of her positions  they were ugly and ineffective rhetoric as proven by her getting the 2d most votes notwithstanding
the problem here is that you assume that this is some kind of political personal attack i would argue thats pretty dangerous territory for ccp to go into considering that shes actually employed in the gaming industry ccp accusing someone in this industry of an nda breach is serious business and canwill almost certainly be legally challenged the lack of a legalarbitrated challenge from ankh is an admission of guilt or no contest  which is career suicideso that said if ccp dismissed sok or myxnee or teadaze as having breached the nda i would not feel as if it were unfair to them despite me liking them a lotliang
1 i dont get your first point at all are you suggesting ankh had some inside track of info that other csm candidates did not i find that highly unlikely i think its fair to assume that whatever she disclosed was known to all the csm in any event the csm could be provided details in any event as they are routinely provided confidential data under the nda2 once again you raise the omg there could be a lawsuit specter if i told you i worked at the most prestigious international law firm in the world and that ccp has no risk of a lawsuit from either disclosing to the csm or not would it matter to you lawsuits arent really that complex  you need liability and you need damages to bring one typically what liability can ccp have here they have accused her of breaching her contractual commitment thats not libel  its a simply accusation if they tell eveyrone or even just the csm the details theyve done nothing more than  explained the details google truth is an absolute defense turn then to damages  how has she been damaged she either broke the nda and got kicked off for it no breach of daamges or shes been falsely accused of breaking the nda and lost her position on a spaceship game committee wheres the harmanyway i dont want to debate this bc im really not an ankh supporter i just also dont supprot what has become the cheerleadingsheeple like willingness of those who want to see her gone just accepting the decree from above ccp is better than that  and the players deserve more
if ccp agreed with your logic and was concerend with the seriousness of their action then you might think they would have gotten csm support or legal counsel before posting it publically by your logic by merely posting the accusation they have guaranteed a lawsuit since ankh cannot simply sit bybut this is all mental  there will be no lawsuit the lawsuit card is a strawman
actually this got me thinkingisnt ankhesentapemkah also the same eva jobse of the piratenpartij nederland or so i was told my thought being that it doesnt look good for politicians to go around breaking confidences loose lips can sink more than internet spaceships
yes this is why i made it a point to submit a tip to geenstijlnlthought they probably dont care enough to act on it
i read it fairly but you still havent answered my point if the csm can vote that whatever ank did was not an nda violation then the logical conclusion is that she shouldnt be booted for an nda violation if they vote that it wasnt an nda violation and that therefore maybe she shouldnt be booted wheres the logical error there please respond this time theres no question of verification ccp removed a volunteer from their volunteer program if the local animal shelter says little billy isnt good with dogs so were not going to invite him back for the dogwalking program we dont demand a neutral third party and a panel of judges besides which as i pointed out and you did not respond to it is in ccps best interest not to extend itself legally and make one single word more of a public statement than it absolutely has to you can be certain that if ank brings this to trial anything ccp says will be used and anything ank says will be used in a countersuit actual financial ramifications always trump forum justice for a corporation and see saying things like this is also rather odd considering its flat out false and was a refrain of anks partisans during the campaign but a fictional one not one single quote was shown to be misquoted not one single view of anks was shown to be misstated if there were fabricated quotes or the like her partisans would have been all over them like fireants when you kick their hills the lack of any such response coupled with the repeated refrain is all that needs to be shown as for the argument that the facts were infective that says nothing bad about the facts but does about those who still voted for ankps you keep using the word strawman wrong talk about a potential lawsuit is not a strawman its a prediction if i say that youve argued that ank is made out of chocolate and is thus yummy then thats a strawman because ive ascribed a position to you that you do not hold saying ank might potentially sue is not at all a strawman
hmm see candidate 2
no im saying that someone that someone thats alert or someone that works in an industry can go into a place and seeknow more than other people who dont she could have talked to different people for dinner had a side conversation with one of the developers or any number of a thousand things it doesnt have to be an inside trackand hell  it could be that the people on the csm do know the actual information thats been disclosed but dont know which information it is let me see if some set math will helplet s  all information about ccplet a  ankhs known infolet c  info presented to csmlet ai  ankhs nda breach infolet ba  ankh blogged infolet bc  csm blogged info unionedtriviallys  a  aia  c she has all information presented to everyone but potentially moreai  c  bcadmission from other csmba  bcso what we actually know is ai  c  bain words the information ankh disclosed is potentially more than what the csm knew but doesnt include the information that she or they bloggedthe harm is in the public accusation of nda breach and the consequences for her career if i were accused of something similar it would become extremely hard for me to get a job and i would almost certainly be fired from my current oneliang
i bet you also dont care as to why joan of arc was burned as long as she was cookeda very sad and ignorant comment from a csm that does not care about honesty facts or any of the innocentguilty stuff  too much brain effort thank you for being so transparent that way we all know who not to vote for in the future
hmm well as a certain ccp person once in a dev blog for apoc patch said everyone in npc factions is an rmter i am certainly going to take their word on everything
i take it all back this is serious business for real this timeits going to affect her career and as i think about it ccp has done exactly what any good lawyer would tell them to do be terse and say nothingim so used to looking at all this as a game but thats her real name and could have real repercussions  hmmsorry me deletes old posts
thrasymachusthe fact that sokrateez sp immediately posted that the reason wasnt her blog comments implies he may know what the reason was and i dont see any outrage from the other members of the csm here or allegations of injustice these same peo
see thats what a strawman looks like you invent something act as if someone else said it refute that invention and then claim that youve refuted their actual argument i never said that the csm had the power to change ccps decision then whats the point csm disagrees with ccp as to how ccp corporate should enforce ccp corporate rules so go have a sandwich if its got no power then whats the point of going through the motions and again the csm is not ccps hr department that isnt their job that isnt their role and id be truly shocked if ccp used them in that capacity corporations get to hire and fire people all the time ank wasnt even an employee you can dismiss volunteers a heck of a lot more easily than contracted employees the argument is that ccp has no responsibility to release information it is actually in their best interest to keep as quiet as possible and despite all the white knighting volunteers for corporations do not have rights to volunteer for that corporation certainly not to the level where they need some sort of tribunal and that a corporation is no longer to make hiring and firing decisions regarding its personnel and volunteersor in your terms be accuser and judge what ccp should do is whatever it does for any other employee or volunteer im reasonably certain that you wouldnt be demanding that the csm step in if ccp terminated a programmer for an nda violation of used a new company to clean their bathrooms
marked for deletion  adida
today is a great dayi also fully support ccps ability to wtfpwn anyone in the csm and boot them out on a whim the csm is something entirely optional and extra work for ccp and if a player is going to break the rules andor be a jackass then ccp should rightfully ban hammer themi also love the ankh diehard supporters throngs of players dislike ankh most of the csm members dislike ankh and ccp boot her out what is the common thread here the problem here is obviously ankh ankh supporters are just trying to get more information so they can claim that her offense wasnt a big deal it doesnt matter whatsoever you cannot save ankh she is gone the bridge is over the bridge is over
pretty much this ccp isnt considering banning the girl they already did whats done is done
what have you taken a level in idiot or somethingan nda is a legal contract that means if ank broke it ccp has the right to pursue litigation for it if they choose to do so at some point anything they say about the matter before the fact can be used against them by anks attorneys  or possibly even give her grounds to countersue ccp doesnt need neutral confirmation but if they decide to get it its going to be from a lawyer a judge or someone else that isnt a clueless moron like yourselfall of you people  if youve got such a jonesing for more details just wait a day or two until ank herself makes a new blog post im absolutely certain that she cant wait to tell us all about it
you mad
she is but calling her a politician seems generous her day job is computer games and the seat she ran for won zero seats in a proportional representation legislature also she has about the political savvy of a giraffe  that was in fact most of the problem with her as a csm rep besides if you move this out of the realm of internet spaceship politics and into the realm of rl politics this is barely a blip on the scandalometer if ccp fired her for racking up a 78000 hotel bill then maybe it might be backpage news by the standards of real politicians
if some rumors that ive heard from multiple sources are true and i have good reason to believe that they are ankh will be very lucky if she isnt charged in a criminal court for what she has allegedly done if the real truth comes out about what shes allegedly done breaking an nda or mouthing off on some blog will seem like a drop in the bucket in comparisonof course this post only means something if the truth comes out and were not whitewashed by ccp and the other involved parties at any rate you heard it here first
no but the fact that ccp doesnt have to tell you  if they dont want to seems to be driving you people all yosemite sam up in this threadyou are unimportant you dont deserve to know anything about what happened htfu and go play the game
i have no idea who ankh is and havent bothered to pay any attention to the scam that is csm but it does strike me as rather suspicious that a vocal member that was recently complaining about ccps lack of commitment to the game suddenly finds themselves kicked off the csm with nothing more than a vague violation of nda for an explanationthen again this is ccp and ive grown to expect them to do whatever the hell they want with little to no explanation
yeah until you realize that at least three other vocal members that were recently complaining about ccps lack of commitment to the game were not kicked off the csm
no hes entirely right as a matter of forum justice yes ccp should submit this to the rest of the csm for review sacking one of nine people who exist mostly to make your life difficult without the other 8 even knowing why looks very sketchy but forum justice is not the only relevant issue here if she does pursue a remedy though the realworld justice system  which is unlikely but not impossible  then the csms opinion is completely meaningless i do not blame ccp in the slightest for worrying about that possibility and covering their asses in case it comes to pass remember this only happened less than ten hours ago according to the massively article ankh is trying to appeal ccps decision internally and is in the process of arguing it over with them knowing how fast ccp works it could easily take up to a week for that to get sorted out to everyones satisfactionor who knows maybe longer and only then will we know if anything is happening at that point i expect either a retraction on ccps parthilariously unlikely a lawsuit on ankhs partrather unlikely acceptance and silence by all involvedplausible or ankh to post her side of the story on one of her websiteslikely when that happens then we can see just how mad the talk of lawyers is until then patience is probably in order though ill forgive some wild speculation for fun this is what happens when you dont pay attention  you work off first impressions and are completely unaware of the fact that you dont know bugger all about which you speak at least four other csm members have said very similar things to what ankh said in very similar places and in very similar ways if theyre sacking people for opposition she would be rather unlikely to be at the top of the list
weasel words make you look stupid though your normal comments make you look stupid anyway so its par for the courseso care to name some of these so called sources and whilst we are on the subject who are you and why should we believe your views let alone care what you have to sayi guess its easy to make up stuff when you have no idea whats going on or the testes to actually make a definitive statement without hiding behind phrases like i heard and someone told me  so go away useless weasel troll
again what is really at stake here is far worse than some simple nda breach or other trivial issue you guys are thinking waaaayyyy too small and insignificant i dont think ankh will be suing anyone if shes very lucky ccp will sweep this under the rug and nobody will find out what really happened
sorry but im afraid i dont speak intrigue
i would be surprised if anyone gave a damn about the csm after this incident
the csm just got a lot better lookin
my god what a way to wake upeve drama best drama
what are you kidding drama is eves bread and butter the weeks leading up to the csm were full of interesting scenarios and all kinds of rumors etc and it drew a lot of attention from the playerbase as well as those outside of the game entirely the infamous larkonisgate didnt kill interest in the csm  why would thiswhat does make people not care about the csm is the ultimate revelation that despite the csm being a stakeholder in theory they have zero practical weight and dont even have any dedicated developer or game designer resources its a paper tiger and the information brought back from the recent trip proved that beyond any doubt
she is space obama
god i love this game
less cloak and more dagger please
he means civil strike uprising down with ccp why do you people care so much if she got kicked or not who honestly cares
look no one not even finn opposed ankhs candidacy more than i did that said i simply do not trust ccp here especially not after t20 for ccp to sack a csm member not long after she made a very vocal blog post excoriating them simply does not seem kosher yes finn is correct that they have absolutely every right to do so but then i have every right to give a 44 magnum a blowjobit doesnt mean that i should ccp should give the players at least some kind of further information if at all possible for their own pr as much as anything elsefrankly at this point i dont know which of them to trust less
t20 was punished for his actions and dragging this dead horse into a discussion every single time ccp does something that players disagree with is getting really freaking oldccp is well aware of the pr this causes they canUFFFDt possibly be unaware and they still came to the conclusion that they shouldand while i would love to hear the details i doubt ccp will deviate from the way theyUFFFDve dealt with stuff like this in the past 7 yearsbut i trust ccp itUFFFDs a business if a business makes a decision that appears to be bad for business there where reasons behind it that we donUFFFDt know that are good for business
bellum posting random trolling on my eve forums nonshocker
given that ccp have allowed and by implication approved of people conducting out of game personal attacks via these forums and over at sc run by a ccp employee including some very juvenile but potentially serious real life threats  dont be surprised if lawyers do get involved
um except that ccp and the csm and ankh herself have all said that this does not relate directly to csm 5incidentally where are all the ankhlings who were calling for larkonis trassler to be permabanned one assumes that this news simply hasnt spread yet and they will call for ankh to also be permabanned perhaps later today
anywayi do not know her but given she run for dutch parliament for the pirate party makes a nda violation very plausible we all know the pirate party gives a rats behind about intelectual and copyright laws so i wouldnt be suprised if she has breached the nda because in her opinion it means nothingalso i have red her statements and her website and based on that i conclude miss jobse likes herself very much thinks she is extremely important while in reality she is not and is not afraid to lie or twist the truth to get what she wants based on this i conclude i dont like her i also strongly suspect a case of narcissism herei do not know what happened but in am pretty sure ccp is in the right hereanyway she lives in which is a city i frequent regularly and know a lot of people i will ask around for more juicy bitsremoved personal data  adida
again this whole mess proves that the csm as an idea works but practically its just a way for people to score a free trip to iceland and to feel important representing the people well nuts to that i wish ccp would take a page from cedegas book subscribers can bring issues to ccp which get published on a website  and every subscriber has one vote per month they can give out the highest votest entry gets worked on the csm could still be there as a checksandbalances body so we can be sure theres no ideas being floated and voted that implement flying pink es in evenow that would be representing the people
larkonisgatedetractors you ing pirate omg how dare you ban his ass forum ban should be game bansupporters way to get caught noob you shouldve known betteralphabetsoup sackeddetractors give us the goods she probably deserved itsupporters omg leave her alone just leave her aloneone side seems to have been much more drama llama about this than the other consistently through both sackings but on different sides of the candidate then again the other side knows how to troll the first from here to iceland and backi for one welcome our censored hacker name supported freetrip to iceland too late vote for me im a chick new csm member
look its been said already but lets have ti againankh was not kicked because of her ccpcritical blogging at least 3 others of the csm have been at least as critical of ccpccp csm members and ankh herself have all confirmed that this is connected with something that happened in a previous csm and is nothing to do with csm5 at least not directly
in my opinion the current csm is the best and most productive so far and i look forward to working with the other council members the coming year
i consider this and excellent change to the csm
you said that earlier quickly followed by a post saying you were just guessing and had no idea so what is it this time do you actually have information we dont have or are you guessing again
whats all this csm aboutanyway vote me for your next csm representative i like beer food and eve i look awesome and that is about itrar rar rar
no it had nothing to do with her blog i already posted that on like the second page or something how thick are you i already clarified this several times in fact multiple csm members including me voiced the same sentiments that she did in fact i was the first to do so and none of us have been reprimanded for it because it contained no nda sensitive material that forces us to conclude that ankh wasnt kicked from the csm because of that
tbh that was unexpected i would say that a member that has been on the csm for a couple of times should know what or what not to say that falls under the ndaanyways i want to see details as everybody else but i suppose this is one of the ongoing investigations of ccp just like 6nj that goes on for 6 months  we get some jack  post that isnt really informative at all still an unexpected turn of events and i really want to see how this plays out for the hordes out there trying to satisfy their needs for drama this will help you while you wait for official newspush this button
i think ccp owes the community a full disclosure on this topic leaving it to rumors and speculation will cause more damage down the road than it will now itll come out sooner or later not a matter of if but a matter of when
links or it didnt happenall ankh has said is that it wasnt the blog and that she doesnt agree with them all ccp has said can be summed up as she broke nda we dont want to tell you why as for csm members i only count sok as speaking for the legitimacy of the claim the others have only commented on ankh or confirmed that the blog wasnt involvedpersonally id like to see mynxee comment on the matter shes seemed to take a middle road on the ankh controversy in the past both acknowledges that ankh has issues yet fairminded enough to recognize and respect the antiankh campaigncertainly ankh leaving the csm is not that a huge lossbut the very fact that csm was created in response to internal corporate dishonesty and favoritism from ccp employees does affect this matter especially because ccp has so far given csm the same treatment you give a group of touring kindergardners oh thats a great idea sweety now run along and play while the grown ups do real work heres a crown to make you feel special smile for the cameraswhile it is their official policy and legal right to stay quiet it definitely does not do well for them pr wiseall it takes is a simple while serving under the term as csm member ank divulged sensitive information to a third party nda agreements are quite purposefully left extremely broad so it is very possible especially considering ccps track record that they found a technicality to use to kick her out simply because they did not like her if the reason is something she did x monthsyears ago then that is just an asinine excuse to can her out of favoritismkeep the details  its confidential i totally understand the need to protect proprietary information do however point to a specific form of breachafter all this whole thing started when a certain unnamed spy uncovered questionable activity and was banned for bringing it up to ccp in a petition as that was breaking the eula
i completely agree with that and more openness has been requested as it stands now the rampant speculation going on isnt doing anyone any good  people are even suggesting that we are using a cheap excuse to get rid of her
ohmygodcan space politics get any betterand to all those who are saying this is bad pr for the csm and ccp think again there is no such thing as bad pr pr is pr more people are talking about space politics now than ever before the issues that are being discussed may not be the best thing for game development but i bet this is sending shock waves throughout the mmorpg industry and players of all games will eventually hear of this in some form or another they may think negatively or positively towards the actions of ccp but they are thinking about ccp and evei would like at some point a statement from ccp detailing the actual breach of the nda however this would remove a lot of the drama and rumours that are spreading through new eden and elsewhere out of game
all seems very arbitrary to me reminds me of certain despotic goverments trying to pretend they are diplomatic when in fact they are noti would have expected at least a report and details of the breach before the member of the csm was removed from positioni suspect there is more here than what is being disclosed to us
oh yes i quite agree that ccp could give us more information about the kind of thing that they think she did im just saying that theres no evidence at all that this is anything to do with her criticizing them in that blog of hersyou might want to consider the legal implications though if  as people are speculating  they did kick her because they suspect her of leaking nda info to a competitior well then thats their right and theyre probably right to have a better safe than sorry policy id do the same although id probably use spoongate as a pretext or something but hey we all know ccp understands pr like a randy boar in a sow shed understands romancebut if they said that in public without very hard evidence then theyd be opening themselves up to a huge legal liability ankh would have very good grounds for suing them for significant damagestldr ccp were probably right to do what they did although as usual they handled it in ccp fashion now that someone with a clue has pointed this out to them theyre doing their usual clamshell routine and theyre right to do that too
linkage
what exactly gives ccp the right to remove her from the csm the members are chosen by us not by ccp i see that they have the right to not listen to anyone and not provide any information or services but is it for them to tell who are our voicesid need more information before i could honestly remove support for her as it stands now shes still my voice towards ccp and ccp is willfully ignoring my indirect voice without giving me a substantiated reason
pretty sure i didnt say that
wow just wow ignoring everything else like breaching a contract are you seriously asking what gives a private company the right to remove a volunteer from one of its programs
correct seems you quoted him  i quoted you quoting him  then it somewhere messed up fixed now
you have been paying too much attention to the politicians the csm has no power except that which ccp temporarily gives it it was created for pr purposes and all the huffing about accountability is because ccp screwed up the expectations management and allowed players to think that csm would be allowed to do anything other than present player feedback in person this removal has made it abundantly clear that ccp has the power to unilaterally remove delegates and i see no visible objections from the same people who were huffing about accountability and transparency last week
the loss of ankh may prove in the longer term to be a positive for the csm i would hope it will encourage players to be more circumspect in their selection of a candidate and the drama bomb bring the csm to the attention of more players even bad news is good prmy greatest concern for the csm is and has always been its focus as a personality contest either players have been selected for the csm because theyre minor eve celebs or they apply to the csm to become a minor eve celeb what the csm hasnt done as far as i can tell is actually worked as a collective  its still a disparate group of individuals all clamouring for their place in the spot light my preference before the first csm was that players ran and promoted themselves as players  not on the basis of their in game personas in the same vein rather than have player x or y post the outcomes of the csm perhaps there should be a csm avatar  an anonymous alt who posts on behalf of the csm as a wholethe minutes and so forth rather reflect this ank said sok said etc etc we dont really need to know who in the csm said what  what matters is the end result not the unsightly process that goes on in the backgroundc
you know whats silly people demanding that ccp discloses the information that was leaked to justify their actions even though that information is sensitive enough to require a nda to assure confidentiality
one of my votes went to ankhi was stating to be a bit annoyed about some of her shenanigans like listing herself as a ccp employee in linkedin still to some forum warriors great dismay she was doing her jobthe ball is in ccps side now why was the second most voted csm booteddoes this exoneration have something to do with her critical stancecsms credibility is on the line here i mean if ankh went batshift insane we the players deserve the true story and not some canned not in our logs text
because she breached the ndaflex thread title reading skills
because she broke an ndanoreading is difficult i take it
thisthen again ive consistently been able to prove that harcore carebears are psychotic virigins as ankh likes to call the pirates more than any other playerafterall i get actual death threats during hulkageddoninappropriate content removedapplebabe
hmm sadly i dont see much good come of this and the way its being handled i dont really care about ankhesemankh being kicked from the csm especially if she did something wrong but what nowwithout the csm members knowing what its all about how can they know theyre not crossing some line as mentioned some blog posts could be viewed as breaking nda i highly doubt being negative about ccp counts i think everyone who likes the game is or has been negative about ccp for extended amount of time although yeah great timing there ccp and what about the replacement csm member ankh had quite a lot of votes and not all of them would have voted for the replacement in politics you would either get someone from the same party to replace someone or new elections in fact looking at the results you can see the reserve members had very little between them 6 votes between 3 people in fact those three people had barely more votes combined than ankh to start with i can imagine to some voters this would seem rather odd especially knowing the difference between the politics of mazz and ankh obviously serious business and all but if ccp really wants the csm to be the elected representation of the players that vote they might want to reconsider the replacement schememe wonders if this whole matter will lead to a better csm and eve
while it is true that well known characters have an easier time getting elected it is also by virtue of them having a deeper or more thorough understanding of the game or at least one particular aspect thereof also they tend to have a large follower base in cases of alliance leadership however i disagree with the rest of your argumentmost of the people elected to the csm are already well known and those who werent havent become more famous in the process i can assure you that the csm did and does work as a collective most of the time that is clearly visible during the iceland meetings if nowhere else there is however no denying that people have differing opinions experiences and obectives but this doesnt prevent things being accomplished on the contrary it is through the exchange of ideas that the csm works bestas far as the elections go people frequently tout their qualities as a person before their ingame persona the latter being used as credential to attest of their knowledge while also serving as a role of vote grabbing through name recognitionan anonymous csm avatar could work for some things not so for othersthe minutes reflect each members opinions and ideas as they are held and presented during the debates that happen you seem to think that people having different opinions and arguing about proposals is a bad thing i believe it is its greatest strength for without a contrary opinion nobody would try and assert the validity of the claims the process is as important as the end result and while the end result should and do come from the csm the process of arriving at that conclusion is a vital part and comes from the members as a voter you would want to know where the elected members stand how they argue foragainst things
calling bs hel im still waiting on some goons and triple aaas to fly to afie and hurt me hahahah plus seeing as how the few ccp devs and mods that play all seem to think npc corps are all rmters and do nothing about their buddys macro ratting in null and low sec etc etc etc we should certainly believe ccp csm will not get better just look at the person who got the most votes we should believe someone who won due to block voting by lemmings in alliances etc is going to due anything other than whine about poor low sec cry babys or how zero zero ith the last amount of pop in game deserves etc etc funny how all these people i mention above hated ank and love ccp always defend low sec null ratting macros while screaming abut mining macros anyway csm was just away for some fanbois to get free trips anyway as for them makeing remarks against ccp in blogs hahhahaha if you guys call that critizing let me send yall a copy of barny the purple dino so yall can sing along
and therein lies the fundamental problem with the csmonly the csm should remove members from the csmccp should not be able to mess with the csmwhile the csm remains as it is it will forever remain irrelevant to all its a pointless branch of ccp that was born of extremely dubious origins which not only is it unable to have any influence on all its siginificantly managed to do is introduce a new level of corruption to the gameccp have managed to create the illusion of choice and power and yesterday managed to demonstrate to all that all those votes count for nothing when ccp decide they count for nothing i feel it remains only a matter of time until the proof of electoral fixing comes along there is simply no reason for ccp to hold a fair election for an irrelevant body which they can simply choose to ignore or disassemble at their conveniencesince there is no electoral monitoring ccp can save themselves a lot of uncertainty and campaign fixing by simply counting only the votes they have predecided to countccps marketing jerk will be counting the column inches this affair is generating and putting in for a pay rise this has got to be worth a new volvo at the very least
during this time the media company submarine took an interest in eve online for the documentary they were making another perfect world they approached me and accompanied me to iceland later on i assisted submarine with the development of their documentary providing them with valuable footagequoting from her portfolio website during her time as previous csm candidate
if some of the rumors that ive heard from multiple sources are true and i have good reason to believe that they are ankh is a little pink and yellowstriped alien from a planet omicron persei 8 if the real truth comes out about what she allegedly is breaking an nda or mouthing off on some blog will seem like a drop in comparisoncan anyone be even more vague about anything then your post is hollow accusations without any proof or backing are just part of an irresponsible witchhuntand no i do not whiteknight for her either because some of the things she said and did were outright silly if not to say idiotic but some people here really need to take a step back and think about their own behaviour
finally one reason to extend game time
so i asume that now that ank is gone there will be no arrest pirates for days in stations when they did crime good riddance
im not convinced that well known characters have a deeper understanding of the game  they may be more vocal but thats about itin my view the csms role is to represent the player base and their views not to debate those views and come up with their own ideas too often the csm seems to be trying to act as defacto game designers id agree with thisarguing about proposals is one thing doing it publicly is another again in my view the csm should be approaching ccp and saying x  of the player base thinks this idea is good y  disagreed we saw the following pros and cons of this idea whats ccps view  and then report back to the player basepersonally im not too bothered about how an individual csm member argues for a given point as that information appears to just exacerbate the personality cult issue if the minutes reported 5 voted for 5 against that would be fine for mecontinuing to report on every comment that comes from a csm member only serves to perpetuate the impression that its a continuing popularity contest for individualsthe recent no new content  fix the game approach was so vague as to be nearly laughable it was simply a popularist appeal to the masses who wouldnt want the game to be fixed c
agreedeven if they dont tell us the specifics of what she is alleged to have done they really need to give more information in order to reassure the player base that there isnt any foul play going on here
bye bye
sok bandwagon you mean the one you got on to even get on the csm for a free triptypical fanboi response just what i expected from one i notice most of the bandwagon is the ones attacking ank cant spell and had no idea she was european which explains alot seems most of you are just mad the person got more votes from individual players than your tight little groups of block voters ah well got to love hypocrits especially ones posting about a single person thats no worse than they are them selves
christ 7 wasted votes oh well
just in time for hulkageddon
cccp stop being obtuse and release a statement on why exactly she was removed the csm is public process voted in by eve neckbeards so those same neckbeards have a right to know why someone who voted in lol is no longer there being all hush hush leads to wild speculation which does not help your case in anywayas a denizin of the eve universe and csm voter i demand our right for information be upheldalso we are still missing those iceland minutes
in the name of ankhesentapemkah ships shall be built to carry our warriors out amongst the stars and we will spread sense to all the carebears UFFFDhallowed are the gangships
really good come back there bud so your an idiotingame makes a personal attack ok haha and thank you for proving my point but hey you should be proud as a fanboi you can type better than me now back to the topic why all the hatred granted some idiotic rants and posts but no worse than 23rds of the stuff you see on eve forums so from where i sitpersonal opinion unlike most posters here i dont claim to speak for all of eveyou guys just did not like the fact ank got so many votes is all i can figure out if ank broke the rules fine but seems kind of fishie for ccp not to state the reason but then again csm being what it is a neat little stunt for pr only i can see why they dont care
you really havent a clue lol
you really think csm is anything more than failed pr stunt
its not its a terrific troll devised to lure people like you and the dud above into poasting the samne things over and over and over again
im a complete lurker on this forum but anyhow this whole incident has left a real nasty taste in the mouthi dont really agree with much ankh said i never voted for her and maybe she wasnt the most harmonious member of the csm however the recent statement by ccp that they wont be commenting is basically a joke of the stated reasons theyve givenallowed to spread most of them are bunk especially this onewe cant disclose more info without making the nda breach worse thats rubbish actually even the nda breach concerned elements of our upcoming x feature or y expansion in z year would be sufficientfact is this is just further evidence that ccp need to employ someone vaguely aware of whats going on right now and just how bloody awful all of their prsupport people actually areremaining csm members keep up the good workedit exact wording from their announcmentas this is a matter regarding confidential data we do consider this to be a private issue between eva and ccp therefore we are unable to comment furtherthe first half of this is garbage really legal challenges could actually prevent them disclosing information but if so this stated reason is merely a smokescreen to hide away future potential legal issues
out of interest what information would satisfy you given that they obviously cant repeat the nda breach
this is better than real life politicsremoved spam  adida
i feel compelled to comment here on a few things the original post subject is ankhesentapemkah removed from csm due to nda breach ccp are the owners of this game they own the processes behind the game and any forums and communications to and from players media and other important stakeholders if they see a clear breach of a mutually agreed contract then they must actnow did they act appropriately in this regard this is the question was it right well we certainly dont know do we nor do the csm comments were raised about poor communications from ccp and im compelled to agree 100 private matters are always to be respected but their statement about this incident was not good communications at all and only led to further speculation and frustration any he said she said comments are not helpful at all the tragedy here is that as far as i understand the rest of the csm dont know the grounds or details on which ank was expelled so its next to impossible for them to make a unified statement on the issue were all left with a wtf feeling at the moment one thing is for sure you cant sweep up problems under the rug either i mean how can we expect csm to respond to something that has been essentially done from an outside entity with no details or reasoning beyond the exclusive statement of breach of ndaall parties involved need to understand that all of this certainly does challenge the integrity of the whole csm concept and electoral processes this is not to the fault of the current csm members but the idea that an democratic player elected group of people representing the player base can be dismantled by ccp with no details no statement of grounds no details given to the csm or even the chair person of the csm is plain unprofessional the comment that all pr is good pr is imo partially true and a valid comment in many cases however due to the nature by which csm is assembled utilized and appreciated or notby some of the player base and perhaps ccp too i wonder if incidents like this really are good for any party or whether the groups of haters and skeptics of which i am not one btw  only continue to increase in numbers as these parties keep on shooting themselves in the foottheres so much that csm could be and so much i believe this csm is trying to be but does ccp really care what they say anymore do they really care about what the players are thinking anymore i mean if the csm isnt working fix itbut its got to be together rightthis incident does show however one thing which i find tragicthey are not together even in a situation that they really must be in order to maintain the integrity that has been built up around this concept from its inception from what i see though its not due to csm not wanting the cooperation but the ball seems to be once again in ccps court the eve world watches in confusionand we all still wait for the summit meeting minutes as well meeting minutesthis long guys
so was she banned from playing eve as well
actually u got it all wrong a lot of the ppl i know including me dislikes ank but voted for her in hopes of some added drama and she lived up to all our expectations
so what are we going to call this very very funny scandalspoongate
nothing to do with any spoons nothing to do with blogslets call it the unfortunate departure of a controversial person for reasons that cant be made public that lots of people are happy about and others not so much
since its pretty obvious you lack any sort of critical thinking skills do everyone else a favor and refrain from voting in anything ever again
what makes you think there has not been one already
intriguing i wonder if this was the cause shrugs
well my opinionthe csm was a failed pr job right from the beginning trying to give a company that is more about modelling the players to their game than the game to its players a caring lookuntil i get proved wrong i will stay with the conviction that eva was just not eve enough to carry the fig leaf pretending that ccp actually followed any advice coming from the csm she devalued an expensive pr campaign so they found a reason to get rid of herwell after all all that does not mater much ccp will do as ccp does either you accept that or leave
we all know this was merely a coverup to hide the fact that ccp and the other csm members found out ankh was an insectoid alien who had stolen the skin of some poor woman after a heroic battle they managed to drive it over the edge of a volcano resulting in an eruption that grounded flights for weeks all over europe
hopefully the csm will be disbanded soon
funny sok the great and allpowerful csm is a troll complaining about people voicing their opinion and since it doesnt agree with his they are trolls and people call people voting for ank stupid doesnt really matter just proves the fact csm is a joke for a free trip
as a member of the pirate party uk id like to emphasise that this statement is factually incorrect  we care an awful lot about copyright law and think that copyright is a worthwhile concept but we think that how it works needs to be modified a bit i encourage people who want to find out more about the pirate movement to check out our manifesto please sling your mud elsewhere between reading csm5 logs spoongate and now this it seems to me that ankh is a complete headcase im slightly puzzled as to how ppnl ever thought shed make a good politician
you already have been proven wrong and are basing your conejctures on nothing so please change your conviction tiathese attempts to make her look like some sort of hero really are patheticremoved a personal attack  adida
not catchy enough i like spoongate better
i liked this suggestion
how mature of you sokratesz how about getting yourself a shower and cooling your head down a bit ankh isnt really a perfect csm or was but you certainly should do better then that
if jacqui smith can be home secretary i dont see why ankh cant be a politician in fact the very aspects of anks character that we dislike seems to be on ethat ideally qualify her for the job
agreed that kind of behavior should be beneath someone in your position
pretty good summary the chances of us getting an answer to those questions is near nil tho ccp will either just leave this matter without comment or they will pull another pr blog post or make csm do it for them where they divert the subjectits quite ironic how the csm actually gives ccp more tools of hiding things from players instead of actually giving the transparency it was supposed to and what boggles me is why players accept this blindly ccp got all rights yeah but we gotta stop being idiots and make sure they close down that pr stunt to put those rl money to good use instead
too late to derail attention from the fact you just made a complete fool of yourself on this thread while using the csm tag so enjoy it while you can because it will be briefthat is all goodbye
confirming that i will vote for sokratesz because they make people see things that arent really therealso confirming bateh will form out mist next election and singlehandedly sabotage your chances of victory sok seriously people need to calm down it isnt the end of the worldjust ankhesencopypasta
yes please speak englishand use a french word
as far as im aware it is the csms rsponsibility to bring to the attention of ccp the playerbases likes and dislikes fears and wants etcso what absurd policy allows the csm to have information the rest of the playerbase doesntseems to me the csm are getting a little y and over stepping there markankhesentapemkah should not have had access to anything the community does not have access to its supposed to go one way csm to ccp not ccp to csmare the csm developers now or just a conduit for the playerbasei want this i tell the csm the csm tells ccp ccp say ok or nonoti want this i tell the csm the csm discusses over biscuits and tea the intricicies and possible flaws of implementing such and idea in which they are given excuses containing information they should not have nothing gets doneor maybe its just me that sees the huge flaw in that practice
cleared up spam off topic trolling and personal attacks
le sigh you have a very valid point there particularly ironic as that is part of the reason she got so many votes in the first place so i suppose we can just get our kicks from the drama and find every opportunity to grief ccp for their tyrannical nature  might as well give em the pr they so desperately crave i feel sorry for the ccp devs that are actually cool people it cant be too fun to work in an environment where you have to walk on eggshells to avoid corporate retributionlast time i checked meissa is not an alt for mynxee 
not implying that this is tied to ankhes issue in any way it may or may not be the case the nda covers many thingsthe relationship between ccp and the csm goes both way were not just there to  and moan on behalf of the players were there to engage in meaningful dialog with ccp provides them with feedback on what theyre working on etcto answer your question the csm gets regularly presented with information the players dont have that nda information usually falls into several categories features that are planned and being discussed ccp uses the csm as a sounding board to see how these ideas are received what improvements the player would want to them etc cfr fleet finder for instance modifications to existing features same as the above see how well they are received the nature of which might be changing a lot of things with regards to tactics markets etc and as such arent publicized ahead of time changes to the game that may or may not make it into the game when developing a game the evaluation of how much time something will take to implement is not easy to evaluate in addition to which some problem may get in the way ccp sometimes choses to disclose features to the csm while not talking about it to the playerbase at large to get better expectation management ie so half of the playerbase doesnt emorage but you promised this as they usually do most of the time for a reason i might add p keeping some things under veil sometimes helps in that regard sensitive data with regards to defense against and extent of hacking attempts rmt macroing etc where the information being available to the bad guys would be detrimental in ccps effort of fighting themso the csm is a conduit that goes both ways
dont be silly and stop trying to act all high and mighty that ccp is inappropriate content removedapplebabe
why is this so necessary the very nature of a nda breach implies sensitive information was divulged to a third party releasing information beyond that the acknowledgement of event only serves to increase the risk of the sensitive information in question being further exposed
you guys do realize pr is not short for publicity but for public relations what you just said does not make any sort of sense if you substitute pr with public relations rather than publicity
i dont see whats wrong with ankhgate ankhbreaksthenda is pretty funny too but the shady nature of the announcement makes me wonder if she actually did anything other than make a bad impressionyou do make a very valid point nonetheless given ccps history t20 nozh smash abathur ccp will not commit to any requests but thanks for the visit it is very difficult and i would even say imprudent to give them the benefit of the doubt when you abuse trust through consistent negligence you can hardly get away with just trust us were the good guys  honestbut i am new to eve so perhaps ive only been hearing about the scandals can anyone point out more than one case where ccp has said dont worry we got your back we just cant tell you yet and actually delivered
personally i think ankhesentapemkah was removed from the csm because no one could pronounce her nameccp back to ankhs comment i would sayankhesentapemkah i would like to be referred to by my full nameccp thats it youre out xix do you have a problem with thatxixpuaskidadajalalapajpa1oaub no im quite happy with xix thanksdisclaimer the above dialog is completely made up fiction and any similarities with actual events is purely coincidental please dont ban me
no actually the only person who has managed to make a fool out of themselves in this issue is ankh and you just now with your impotent eyedaggers post sok is going to serve a whole year at least he can be trusted to honor the legal agreements he makesi think ccp deserves a prize for extracting the most epic rl tears tbqh ill talk with the guys about it
first of allthank you for your responsei do believe however that the csm would function better as a one way street if you will theres no reason the issues brought up by the csm need to be discussed by anyone other than ccp the csm should be a medium and nothing moreunfortunatly for ccp they have created a game where trolling scamming and general grief are commonplace and openly supported it stands to reason that the playerbase would reflect this and ccp appear rather blinkered in there expectations in that regardi have always thought the csm as you described in the above quote is generally a good idea unfortunately when it comes to eve it is proven to not be so and so it is logical to find a common groundit appears this is going to be a lesson hard learned by ccp and it is unfortunate that people such as yourself are being dragged down by those with an innability to handle reallife responsibility at least as far as the csm goesin closing the only way the csm will function in a meaningful way as you described in the quote above is either without elections or extensive vetting of all candidatesagain thank you for your time
edit nevermind i shouldnt be allowed to post so early in the morning as i tend to misread easily to begin with
there could be any number of reasons why ccp has chosen not to state exactly what eva did hell it may even be to protect her reputation from further damage with larkonis it was an ingame thing that only had consequences with gameplay specifically whatever eva did could be much broader and deal with much more sensitive things
ccp claims that the idea of the csm is a better communication between players and ccp then it is kinda weird not communicate about the csm to the players if the entire idea was to communicate
you forgo the entire idea namely that theres things that ccp doesnt want to be public and thats their bloody right
discussion about forum moderation is not allowedapplebabeanywaythe problem with csm is that its character linked
discussions on forum moderation are not allowedapplebabein any event i had enough curiosity about the event to scan this thread after reading some of the wild comments i honestly couldnt care less about the story behind ankhgate reality simply couldnt live up to this hype
hello redlion would you be kind enough to say more about what you mean by characterlinked for instance would you have csm candidates run as rl persons and not be allowed to overtly or covertly link themselves to ingame characters if i am understanding you correctly it is an interesting idea and id like to hear more delilah
yeah but i heard this crazy rumor that like by better communication they were totally talking about regarding gameplay issues and concerns yo
in regards of this my impression is that csm candidates get voters by having opinions similar to a certain type of players be it hisec dwellers lowsec etcafter they have been voted into office the candidates work purely on their own agenda im not sure this is correctwhat i would like to see is the voters actually forming the followers of their candidate coming forth with ideas improvements to their candidate basicly a dialogue between voters of that specific cadidate and the candidate himselfherself so it isnt just a personal agendathe followers could collect data do extensive research and what would work and why etc and it all gets filtered in a way through the csm candidate and ccp gets more than just one opinion
as a mostly former patent attorney ive had a lot of trade come my way because ndas are a somewhat precarious way to keep sensitive corporate data confidential it is therefore something of a leap of faith for ccp to disclose information to the csm under nda and i think that should be acknowledgedas for the present circumstances well i know jack like everyone else if the breach was a serious one i think it is understandable that ccp would want to close the whole issue down without any further comment it is not beyond the realms of the imagination to assume that some people in ccp are quite anticsm and would rather not disclose anything in the first place probably the lawyers m if not senior management so the people running the csm in ccp are probably under a fair bit of pressure here of course if there was more politicking involved and the breach was not significant but more of a ruse to oust an unpopular member of the csm then saying nothing more about it would be somewhat scandalous and a continuation of the issues that the csm was set up to addresswhich of these possibilities is it i dont know and i wouldnt expect to know but in my experience companies are not usually as evil as people would like to believe and ccp in all fairness does put up with a lot of bs from the playerbase with relatively good grace so i personally believe there is a significant issue and ccp have their hands tied in how to deal with it it therefore falls to the csm to do their job and to keep prodding ccp about the issue and to communicate clearly to the playerbase what they find out emotions are high right now but the csm really need to take a step back and start behaving as a more coherent professional body in my humble opiniontldr ccp cant really comment further regardless of the severity of the breach so we have to take it on faith or not that this is a serious issue
my summarycsm travel to iceland for a nice chat with ccp csm ask ccp nicely if you do really care about the players please can you fix all the stuff that makes us unhappyccp say sorry we cant half the company is working on a new game dust and the other half is working on what is sort of a new game incarna so none of that stuff is ever going to get fixed we did have a quick look at it and realised that we cant fix it anyway because we dont know how thats why we are working on new games were hoping people will forget about all that stuff thats wrong with eve when they can walk around stations and do fps type stuffcsm politely ask ccp whats the point of the csm then as we can only raise current player concerns these concerns revolve around the game that thousands of people are currently paying a monthly subscription to play they would like it to work they are not currently concerned about other games or future ccp projectsccp reply the point of the csm is to persuade less intelligent eve players that ccp are doing something proactive about the ongoing problems in eve the csm is buying us time until we give the less intelligent eve players a new toy our marketing gurus have told us that once they have a new toy theyll forget about lag etc and continue to happily subscribe without complaining now csm sign this and shut yer cakeholes if you want to keep getting your free trip to icelandmy conclusionsmost eve players dont know or care what the csm is most eve players dont read this forum ccp have no need to continue with their csm charade no one cares the majority will judge ccp products not by their promises of development ongoing support debugging streamlining or optimization they will simply ask the questions is it fun does it work is it worth the money whether or not ccp chose to listen to their players or not is up to them but if their policy of releasing unfinished and untested products continues i suspect they will see the good sense of the public prevail they will vote with their feet
ccp call the creators of killzone 3 let them make your shiny fspget that team you have working on it back to solve the issues that are reported as thats exactly where your prioritys should besad she got asked friendly to shut the f up claim she did it not correctly what a shame
i dont think its a terribly big proposal to ask for some further information than what weve been given we cant expect to learn it all but something a little more concrete than weve received so far would a nice and it wouldnt have to be written in an ndabreaching manner
by way of responseand just so youre aware i acknowledge your comment even if your argument was shot down by guns trained on it more quickly than mine could be
your summary is inaccuratefirst of all dust is not being worked on by ccp reykavik but by ccp shanghai a significant part of ccp resources are allocated to incarna  some new stuff what we said are we do not know yet how much resources are going to be available for the things we deem important they may be small or large we just dont know we think they are going to be small and are going to be unhappy if thats the case but thats impossible to say before the expansion planning is finished and thats not happened yet so rushing and saying we wont get our requests heard is premature at this stagealso your paraphrased ccp reply is incorrect while there is no doubt that there is a gap between players perception and that of some of the decision makers within ccp ccp is giving us the tools to make our voice heard by among others appointing someone to attend the regular planning meetings that are held if it was only paying lip service they wouldnt do thatevery csm that happens we get more and more influence and tools to make our voice heard its a slow process to be sure but ccp has the balls to try player representatives so cut them some slack well see how it goes before saying it failsall the devs we meet seem genuinely interested in the feedback we give them and responsive to our requests the big barrier we were yet to go through is getting our stuff into the release planning and we got it this time time will tell i for one intend to make full use of the opportunity were given
i dont think you understand the situation breaching an nda involves disclosing sensitive information to a 3rd party without authorization to do soit is possible that by disclosing more specific details of the event that ccp could risk increased exposure of the sensitive information involved you all also have to carefully consider that this most probably isnt something that occurred ingame but in fact quite out of it  a world not administered by ccp but by far greater powers with their own terms and conditions to be followed
personal attack removedapplebabeccp are no saints lets all get this into our heads plspersonal attack removedapplebabe but she did something that ed ccp off enough to do stupid thingsthis is interesting its interesting to see how ccp will handle thisif they are unable to cope with this in a way that will satisfy the very people thatpay them they will prove to be more rotten than we all feared they are
never said theyre saints far from it however as much fun as bashing ccp is its unjustified in this instance i resent you calling me inappropriate content removedapplebabebtw ive never been a puppet im here to break the dychotomy what do you prefer that i get in with the crowd and say yeah ccp are idiots they ignore us this is just pr or provide a point of view thats actually thought out and representative of my experience in dealing with ccp for the past 2 yearsalso ive been labelled a few things but never ignorant whatevermy opinion about ankhe has been clear for a long while and is visible in many places on this forum and elsewhere i dont think i need to repeat that its in line with yours only a bit moreso pi agree ccp could handle this eva being kicked a bit better but their maneuvering margin is narrow and i dont think they could disclose exactly what she did how they figured it out etc not just yet anyway
i understand that part im just saying there are ways to talk about the incident without revealing the information that was under the nda they can give us more info while protecting their assets can they not
dear fellow eve players and ccpim aeliusbeen with eve since beta 4 back in december 2002this is something i wanted to do for a long time for several reasons the main reason being that i keep asking myself the same questionhow can i help eve become a better space mmoso its my plan to run for the next csmduring this winter northern hemisphere i hope to have enough rl time to come up with a strong candidacy to do just that run for elections and win a seat in csm i realise that the actual csm was just formed and some of you might think this is perhaps premature but i want to have time to grow up support to ear the players and ccp to have a better understanding what needs to be done and what people want so i am fully ready as a candidate when the time comesin this 1st post i want to ear from you players and ccp what are the qualities required to a csm candidate to run for elections and winie is he required to know code or to be a computer freakare the ideas that he carries more important that the his technical capabilityin case of winning a sit in csm what is to be expected from such a personplease dont troll or flame try to be constructive when replyingtks
i wanna csm who just wants to watch new eden burnno need for fancy excuses dont fly what you cant afford to lose or your fault for not xyz or i should be allowed play the way i want to playjust let it burrnnnnnn
to be perfectly honest ccps response to the current csm pretty much places the csm in line with such things as window dressing and fluff that has no meaning or ability to do anything of value or worth my personal opinion is that ccp just needs to finally admit the csm was nothing more than wool to pull over the players eyes to shut them up while ccp continued to do the very things the csm was supposedly created to address in the first placeso what i am looking for in a csm candidate nothing because they do nothing effect nothing and mean exactly nothing
yeah i too get the feeling that the power of a csm stops at rearranging office furniture or re filling the water coolerlatly semes like a bit of a school prom style popularity contest with the general eve player base as loosersif you want to improve eve improve csm itself and make sure they are listened to and things actually happen because of it
moved from general discussion to jita park speakers corner
ccp wants you to be nice and just accept everything ccp says without any kind of critical thoughtplayers just want amusement out of csm since they dont have any influence anyway
noted my candidacy is not lets go to iceland meet the devs and have a beer with oveur kind of ideai too have grasped during my eve years what you stated above this candidacy was something i have put a lot of thought into along the years theres a time when something must change and my candidacy after more than 7 years in eve illustrates just that im not the owner of the ultimate truth nor my plan is to go to iceland to tell them ccp how to run their own game i have a very distinct and well visioned idea how things could be a lot better in evebut i also have very strong ideas on how a csm with true power could enhance the eve experience for all of us and for other players out there that never tried it before
short version ccp wants obedience and feedback that does not go against their perception of the state of the product for succesfull pr players want results which requires long lasting and carefully executed professional approachnot a troll btw just look at ccps marketing efforts compare to original statements on csm mission scroll forward through time from there and keep watching the various dev interviews on gaming sites
personally im looking forward to the minutes ccp release before passing judgement on this csmif its anything similar to the qen ie a marketting stunt with very little real info then the csm is worthlessif it has some meat and potatoes discussions with more than simple ye ofc well fix that soon then maybe there is still hopepersonnaly i want a candidate who understands that pve is part of this game as well as pvp and that while not everyone pvps almost everyone pves for isk and making pve more fun only adds to the game not detract but i also pvp so i want someone who will help improve that side of things just as muchi dont want someone overzealous and bat crazy like ankh or someone whos only response to detractors is your stupid or good troll like soki like teadaze level headed responses to things he seems good at standing back and looking at things objectively which is quite difficult with something you enjoy but you also have to be able to stand up to ccp and say your ing wrong and not back down when they go defensive and bring out charts and tables after all thats what the csm is for imo
from the latest scandel i would say someone who can keep there word and not break the nondisclosure agreement and knowing personaly that you are a stand up guyhonourable and trust worthy you get my votewe need more people who would go out of there way to make eden a better place for all involved be it carebearing or those of the more violent persuasion not just those who would use the position to line their or there friends pockets with isk
i dont need a csm member to have ideas ive got lots so have others you take our the players ideas and represent them thats it its not difficult but successive csms seem to have made it the most convoluted process imaginablec
the potential to generate drama in large quantities is a desired quality
they should bring the issues of the players to the csm not have their own agenda and ignore everything elsethey should be trustworthy see larkonis and ankhesetapemkah for bad examplesthey should be able to talk about any topic in a civilized manner see sokratesz for bad examplei think apart from the two mentioned above the csm has a very good setup this year especially mynxee and teadaze are doing their job very well
thats my favorite complaint against elections its nothing but a popularity contest think about that for a few minutes and let me know when the well duh moment hitshint a democratic election is by very definition a  
thats because csm is often used as a vanity fair for either players andor alliancesgood ideas and goals are related to second plan fortunately i am not in a big alliance nor i have a big ego to defend that is going to add an extra level of challenge to my candidacy since i am not notorious or famous but will give me the necessary focus to the task at hand
unfortunately it also means you will have to work absurdly hard to win sufficient votes  although its by no means impossiblec
i dont agree that ccp want a sycophantic council far from it the direct and often critical feedback is well received and has resulted in some productive discussions the results of which will not be seen for many months adding the csms approval to something can support the devs within ccp who want to work on those specific featuresi agree totally i ran on that platform which is partly why ive been elected twice over and above that i think player ideas should be presented to csm as raised by the players before any discussions start so that any changes made by csm are clearly documented i believe in accountability and transparency of the csm process sadly as seen recently we are sometimes restricted when ccp are involved in discussions due to nda etcthe issue raising process is pretty much unchanged since csm1 though iirc entering items on the wiki was added later csm5 have been discussing ways to improve the raising and supporting of issues by the players but i dont know when this will result in any improvement as a stop gap we are working on tools to make tracking raised proposals easier and to add searching of existing issueswhat people dont realise is that the csm process has been evolving all the time the biggest change was with csm4 when the summit format changed and stakeholder status was granted it would of course be nice to be able to point to a list of issues raised by players via csm which are now in game whilst the csm does have some influence in setting priorities it doesnt have the absolute power to force ccp to develop anything this is not a failing in the csm as such other stakeholders within the eve project have exactly the same restriction but players are a demanding bunch and without quick and tangible results they are quick to writeoff the csm as a publicity stunt
you just dont want to rock the boat because you want to work there at least i am really starting to get that impression either that or you are very very naive lets be straight for a sec while devs may love and they probably do love direct and critical feedback the people who make the decisions dont if they did then a lot of things weve seen over the years would have been signalled by devs to their bosses and acted upon look at how things were in the running up to dominion great work great support everybody was happy then what happened yeah half was torn out and they unleashed nozh a very typical action to do
im not naive i am simply working with more information such as items under nda and even the attitude and body language when talking to devs at the summit trust me the boat was well and truly rocked during many discussions and ccp were actually surprised at the reaction to certain things devs working daily on a feature are not always able to see the shortcomings and escalate those to their bosses there is a technique in programming called buddy checking to avoid this which is where you bring in a fresh pair of eyes who can frequently spot issues in the code which somebody who has spent weeks working on it has missed a similar rule applies with testing you need fresh eyes from somebody to see the problems youve missedive not worked under the scrum system but by having a self contained team of game designers programmers qa and so on i wonder if they are too close to give objective feedback amongst themselves until it is too far advanced to make widescale changes somebody with more experience of scrum should chime in thoughthe decision makers at ccp have made mistakes sure we called them out on on some but to think that they stick their heads in the sand and ignore negative criticism is ridiculous another problem is the long planning stages of a project like eve the short term planning covers 612 months of development which doesnt leave much spare for working on additional issues this isnt an excuse for inaction but it does add contextapocrypha was certainly a good expansion and it raised the expectations for dominion which in the end were not met at least the players dont think they were and fleet fights etc certainly took a hammeringwe spent a great deal of time criticizing various aspects of dominion at the csm4 summit sadly it wasnt early enough in the dev cycle to discourage them from then rushing the release of tyrannis and so we spent a great deal of time criticizing that i dislike forcing teams to hit arbitrary release dates and releasing whatever results or dumping partly developed features never to be completed it would be better imo to have more flexible release schedules based on the progress of featuresim hopeful that they wont make the same mistake again but if they do then ill give up on the csm process too
reading through this forum and seeing the endless rubbish that is coming out over incidences of the past couple of daysweeksmonthsyears  i think its time for ccp to just ditch the whole idea of the csmfrom this players pov its a waste of time and effort less than 10 of the player base votes in the farce that is portrayed as an election the so called representatives garner votes mainly from game alliances and alttrolling campaigns and every csm results in more of the same  nda breaches meta spying allegations of gm corruption etc etc etcto date nothing that has been discussed at any of the csms over the past couple of years has resulted in any ingame changes lots of hot air and forum poasts get generated but unfortunately this is not a balloon based mmo so all that effort goes to wasteso its time to disband this farcical concept its time that ccp used the money that goes into the csm to hire some more qa or devsnow that would be a worthwhile way for ccp to spend the money we give it each month
one member of the csm was acting out and shes the one thats been removed the rest of them are doing an excellent job
time to disband the forums
how effective has the csm been in getting player driven initiatives acted upon by ccpis the csm anything more than a sop to the player community in order to keep us quiet and out of ccps collective hairhave the csm delivered value for the time and resources spent by both the player base and ccp on maintaining themwhen you can deliver concrete negative answers for these questions backed by solid evidence then you have a case until then even though i tend to agree with many of your statements there is no point in putting forward a proposal
supported i dont care for the csm at all
we dont know possibly yes possibly no theres no way of truly telling personally i think yes  in the past ccp have reacted to things based on suggestions on forums and having a group of people sat in a room telling them what the people that voted them is more compelling than that ccp changing the csm to a department within the company itself shows they do have some faith in themhardly keeps us quiet up until csm came around it was the forums as a playeroutlet and nothing but have the forums quietened down because of the csm no infact people are more willing to come forward with suggestions given the new forum outlets at the very least the csm forums are an expansion of the features and ideas forums and a concentrated place for other gripes from other forumswe dont know and what resources spent by the player base i take 5minutes yearly to vote i base my votes on forum reading  that i do regardless of if there was a csm around even if this is nothing but a pr boondoggle ccp may of got their moneys worth in the advertising generated from the csm even the bbc had a csm storywhat people want is seemingly a statement from ccp  feature a was suggested by the csm and then implemented thats kinda redundant tbh any idea may well of been floating around inside ccp before the csm  csm may give them a list of an order of priorities basically  as a playerbase we really havent lost anything with the csm your view changes on how much weve gained like i said before  at the very least the playerbase has gained advertising for eve at its most a voice of the people still am very much in favor of the csmbefore if you had a gripe you talk about it on the forumsafter if you have a gripe you talk about it on the forums csm candidates take note about what to talk about in iceland and talk to ccp about iti dont see whats wrong with that
oh no please how would i spend my time at work 
 persepolii call your bull  say youre an angry troll that decided to spam since the latest csm development with ahnk being bootedcsm changes have been implemented throughout the years and the csm on itself is an unique devplayer approach that ma
i think the csm are doing a good job having read the chat logs for their meetings so far i was struck by how well nearly everybody other than ankh were pulling together ive also been encouraged by how strong a chairman mynxee is and how determined she is to ensure that the csm makes a real difference for the playerbase check out this blog postits not time to disband the csm on the contrary i support them and hope that they can carry on with their good work even better now that ankhs disruptive influence has been removed
csm is garbage always will be garbage its a pointless schmoozefest that takes up too much of ccps time
there was the free 100000 sp whether you like it or not it is a change that the csm suggested wasnt it
please dont be dumb i really wanted to ask you this because your post reeks of dumb
demanding csm to be disbanded kinda makes it directly opposite dont you think make your mind or smth
lol  another inane comment from the rentacrowd ok mr brownnose ill call your bs  name me one  just one  csm requested change that has been implemented by ccp that they were not already considering implementing as part of their dev cyclenow off you go little pet go spout somewhere else and leave the big people to talkoh and as a postscript i actually voted for sok as we members of atlas were asked to do as a favour to an alliance blue no idea who ank was until she her csm career blazed into nothingness but it did get this thread started
skill queue was one feature that ccp was very set against but the csm championed
things that have had a greater impact on eve than the csm17 page hurf about titansthreadnaughtshacking of nonassociated websitesvolcanoesspreadsheetsvolcanoeslittle clumps of rocks that some pagan 800 years ago might have housed elves bjorkdoodlepadsbatphonesobligatory rotten shark reference
personally i would prefer if they dropped the csm and brought eve tv backhaving a tv show about the game you play is kind of cool whereas a free trip given to a bunch of people elected by socially ed players isnt cool from a business perspective ccp gains much better marketing value from the tv show than they ever would from csmplus stevie is looking pretty good these days and appears to have much more confident public presence so give her old job back
why stop there time to disband the internet
sign here if you think overall the csm especially the current sitting is doing an ok job if you dont support the csm theres another thread around here you can sign there yes it was a slow start yes theres been some scandals i personally want to see the outcome of the current one but its starting to make progress look at the recent downtime with skillpoints several other major points like a lot more transparency with the devs on a technical level has happened and there are plenty of other things that they have gotten done recently
i support the csmjust kidding i support mynxee but the rest of em can get hit over the head with a spoon for all i caremoar info
its always been a slow start that doesnt start till after a yearoh wait csm is a waste of time tbh
great work
i get the feeling changing the font or the size of said font isnt a simple job due to how complex the ui windows are words would get chopped off the font labels of ui windows wouldnt be aligned properly would just be a nightmareso complete ui overhaul pleasep
with the sudden depature of the second most voted for memberno comment on that issueand the 3k who voted for her added to the 750 votes that were spoiled this now leaves you with a mandate set by less the 10does this  still make u feel u should speak for the wider eve playerbase or does it make you feel more like sticking to your own mandateim am just curious to know the question itself should not be taken as direct or indirect notion of how i feel about csm
psh this is democrazy even if only three humpties go voting the election is still valid just because no one else gives a  doesnt mean people wont be doing it by not voting those 90 agree with whatever result the election turns outyou could always vote to disband the csm and if you get those 90 to vote for it i am sure no one would argue against it good luck
any voting system is always run by the people that actually take the effort to vote considering that it took a few seconds effort to log in and cast a vote this was not a hard system to participate inif you feel the csm isnt based off a large enough  of eves population voting then run publicity to get people to vote next time disbanding any system because people cant be bothered to vote is ridiculous the united states routinely has national elections where only slightly more than a third of the populace votes midterm elections and larger presidential elections where slightly more than half vote no one is calling for it to become a dictatorship because of that factdecisions are made by those who show up or in this case vote
i make a policy of not giving a damn about the opinions of people who dont even bother to show up to vote so 100 of the eve players who matter had a voice in the csm election that sounds like a pretty good number to me
troll me for being lazy or being frustrated by trying to dig up and use a decoder ring to find out the correct mintues for the csm meeting but what should happen is thiswhenever you make a post that list all the things that will be talked about in the meeting the moment the minutes are available you then edit the op and put a direct link in therealso wtb summit meeting minutes even though i know everything is being done to delay them until they are mutilated enough to edit out anything of value
best place for csm created minutes at the moment is the csm database which has the minutes linked as they become available along with simple voting results for the tldr generation the missing csm5 meeting 2 and 3 summaries will be up soontm but the raw logs and voting results have been up since the day after the meetingswere still waiting for the second revision of the summit minutes to appear after mynxee added 8 pages to their original version
more clicking and searching wouldnt it be simpler to just have it linked already in the thread anyone new to the csm stuff will come in here and not know about your personal website
ive always preferred to post a new thread to separate the pre and post meeting discussions however to make things easier we plan to put a sticky at the top of this forum with links to the meeting thread and minutes etc this master thread can then be linked from the meeting threads and the circle will be complete
lol you still think i was the problem here funny
myz
between pettiness and childish behaviour and ccps unwillingness to allow the csm to influence their resource allocation in bringing about what the csm calls for  the whole experiment is a jokeenjoy the trips to iceland enjoy the forum and site updating enjoy the fact that you belong to an elite membership of eve playersuntil ccp promises and carries out those promises to earmark resources to fulfil the requests the csm lobbies for isnt it a waste of time and energy better spent elsewherethe producers of eve has their own agenda which of course if fair enough but to be so intractable is counterproductive to the entire reason the csm programme was established for
all this proves how much of a joke csm isits of no benefit to the eve community is a waste of everyones time and effort and is quite frankly unrepresentative swill served up to the player base as some sort of salveand i dare anyone to name one productive game change that resulted from any of the csmsfree trips booze and quietly replaced titans notwithstanding
the csm is a joke
yes one of them anyway its not an either or type situation ie whatever ankh did doesnt affect judgment on your actions the rage post would perhaps have helped you understand while the edited post would probably not cause people like you to reflect on their conduct
maybe there wasnt much wrong with my conduct after all and maybe therefore it doesnt need awhole lot of reflecting on
thank you for proving my point that youre too simple to learn from mynxees corrected post and that indeed you could only possibly if youre not too thick even for that have learned something from the ragepost
spreading out mission runners should link to
link fixed thanksalso the request for contact folders was requested at the summit which the minutes should show whenever they get released i am also going to raise the issue at saturdays csm meeting as previously promised
incidentally although the first four proposals are by a member who is no longer with you i believe that they are still very relevant and very good proposals i trust you still intend to give them your full attention
not to worry  ankhs proposals will be treated just like any others in accordance with whether they were passed or failed by the csm in that meeting
tldr the csm is a pointless distraction to both ccp and eve players that imbalances the game longform  voting drama pointlessness that is the csm it does not represent the playerbase less than 10 of players actually even bother to vote the same people run and get elected each csm cycle do they suddenly have new ideas they did not have before no its just a lame popularity contest with electioneering that is mostly decided by 00 superblocs voting for their candidates with the same people being elected each cycle the entire csm concept is stale with ccp being busy with their own view on how the development of eve should go the csm really has no point you could hire one person to read through submitted forum proposals for presentation to devs every six months and youd have something more valuable than the csm weve already had csm delegates abuse their position to try to unbalance the game it gives alliances who have enough members to be on the csm a nice longview of what is coming up what to expect an unfair advantage over alliances that dont bother with the csm process if you think these people arent coming back to plot and plan to take advantage of insider information youre delusional its why you see the same people again and again on the csm they dont have new ideas they just want an inside trackthe csm shames and embarrasses this great game when idiotic csm pointlessness becomes drama and gets splayed across the internet a csm throwing a spoon at another use of this to cheat at the game with insider information it makes eve seem like a joke with a class of players artificially given an unfair advantage and at no benefit to the general eve playerbase ccp stop wasting your time and our time with these clowns get rid of them and the process it benefits nobody and imbalances the game the csm is crap burn it down
this definitely needed another thread
could use fifty more threads saying the same thing theres nothing else of worth in this forum
this topic already exists feel free to add to that thread
can we vote in another that isnt uslesssomeone that when ccp says no we are a dust companythey say  you ccp wake the  up we are customers
well what do you expect in the absence of information a suddenly introduced vacuum tends to suck in everything around it rumours innuendos double entendres about peoples real motivations etc and tbqh you would think that the csm and ccp would of realised this by now  oh wait we are talking about the csm here 
you mean the one who implied she worked for ccp on her cvresume oh im sure there were no selfish motives there at allc
would just make people create a shell corp for their scouts will take them all of 30 seconds to join it
this
yeah but his fanfest presentation was top notch
i lold at the end of your blog where you say those goon bastards have griefed me
fix them pls
based on some of the reading on this topic i have added changes 3 and 4 to this proposal i the reasoning behind these changes remains the same adding more plexes throughout the fw regions would prevent blobs from winning i see no reason why you shoudl need a probe launcher to fight in plexes
the most eagerly anticipated patchnotes are always the fixes tweaks and ui improvements that are hidden behind the art teams headline actsomething has gone wrong when a hypothetical peoples patch based mainly on community interest is far more likely to contain technical improvements and mechanics adjustments than the developers offering and far less likely to contain halfbaked excuses to make shiny new models
i see this coming a distant last place behind walking in stations attracting rpers and more social types and fps console play attracting well console players which are aimed squarely at expanding ccps customer base and thus generating more subscriptionswithout customer action that actually affects their revenue stream like oh delaying account renewal for a day each month or something  and emailing customer services with your reasoning there is no driver for ccp to amend their vision and development strategy
very much supported
10
definately supported constantly adding new areas to the game is good but not when they arent improved upon or fixed when brokenplease fix things and stop adding new broken things
absolutely this is the single most important frustrating issue with eve game play
the previous csm did mention it hopefully progress is being madeui fonts ccp pleased everyone by announcing they hired a font guy which means that improvements on that front are to be expected
supported why remove it in the first place
supported
quite reasonableregardingi think there are many aggregations of items  eg hangars jetcans bays assets  where volume is sometimes of interest to the player a general widget capability throughout the eve ui that provided a sortable volume column with total would be even better ie address the general need not just this specific instance
that is a very good suggestion chrisisherwood
another thing that should already be in the game ccp stop inventing new things to put into the game and  up fix the stuff we have
excellent suggestions please implement also red frog has excellent service have used several times
supported
up
not supported keep the learning skills if people want to learn faster they will invest the time in them if not then they lag behind
translation im afraid of noobs who skill up their combat skills quicker and pwn me in pvp because i have to player skill at all
no i dont like thisnot supported
im struggling to understand your logici mean you say it yourself people who choose to do combat skills first will get the full benefit of the training bonus so yeah
why is this thread languishing so badly as bad as lowsec is currently i would expect more enthusiasm from the lowsec population if you dont agree with all of the ideas here at least agree that something needs to be done and hash it outpersonally a note here  this isnt my outlaw account although this character does have some shady tendencies  i like most of the ideas but would add a few morei know this may not be real popular with the outlaws of eve but if bounty hunting actually got some love from the devs in the form of skills missions career path etc that alone would draw more people into lowsec hunting the pirates and smugglers and possible overlords thus giving the pirates some much needed tougher fights with the possibility of better lootsalvage instead of the random noob ganks or simply fighting each other for lack of preyalong with the black market make the items that are commodities actually useful within the eve universe as an example slaves should be usable in pi to increase production but with deterrents to their usethose are the two that popped into my head atm but im sure there is more cmon folks lets keep this thread alive
i wont and thx even scarcastic post can be good
supported
agree the api needs some major work done
api needs updating
agreed
yes overview ui and chat channels should be server side supported

yeah this is something that needs looking at i support a fix for this as soon as possible

thank you
i dont know about you guys but i really enjoy having a socket close while on a cap op then log back in with almost no cap everyone else in the fleet loves it too cap should change to random levels while you are logged in for additional funno this stuff is really annoying reminds me of the you ejected now everything is offline bugmechanic strong support for this
i hope youre not talking about torps and giving blasters double optimal which transfers to 22km is not medium by any standards barrage l has 36km falloff scorch l gets 45km optimal blasters should be something inbetweenand no they dont need anymore dps the problem is the inability to deliver said dps battleships dont go 12kmsec anymore and webs arent 90 more dps on blasters will mean what 2k dps blasterships this aint gonna fly blasters just have too many downsides to just be fixed with more dps because now they work only on paper
supported except the proposed change of the deimos falloff bonusalso if active armor tanks were on par with active shield tanks one wouldnt need 2 reppers on the brutix for example and there wouldnt be such a need for more powergrid erik
i think if i could only get behind a single issue for the rest of all my possible csm terms i think that this would be the one we need devs to get back to playing eve it is pretty clear that sometimes in statements made by devs about game mechanics you can get the sense that they dont really play the game or at least they dont play with the same part of the game they work withi dont want to mention names because it would be unproductive and i would not be able to back up accusations with their actual activity level in eve but i think that there is a problem of devs not playing the game especially after the t20 scandals and devs getting outed im sorry that some of you devs got traumatized over eve and dont think youll enjoy coming back but that was three years ago and eve needs you now it wont be hard to get back into whatever part of the game is relevant to any devs job even 00 sov warfare if i can get in bull alts to major alliances dev characters can get in too microsoft excel is not eve pvp and the test server is not eve sovereigntywe dont need them to play eve at the expense of their work time or family time we dont need to name and shame any devs who dont play eve all we need is for the creators of the game to experience the unpredictable end results of their creations so that when they get back to the drawing board they will be more passionate and articulate about what exactly needs to be done to make the game more fun this is part of their job devs balancing pvp should get into pvp alliances devs balancing sov should get into powerbloc alliances devs balancing missions should join a missionrunner corp if they get outed as a dev well its unfortunate but at least they know what the dangers are and they can take precautionsand for all the devs that still play eve thanks you guys are awesome you are doing your job
supportin dis
yes and mask your ips properly this timeedit dammit forgot the checkbox
yeah they should play  just dont cheat it shouldnt be hard
ccp talks about players having stakeholders the devs need to be stakeholders as well they need to have something invested in this game a reason for excellence beyond a paychecksupport
ip masking aside dont put a normal char on the same acc as your ccp dev char or gm char the api sees everythingbut yes devs and in my opinion gms should spend more time playing the areas they are working oncould be assigned to work onneed to function in cooperation with other areas so it would be easyer to figure out how to change stuff in a more usefull manner instead of a completely useless way where the servers etc allowfor example there was a lot of back and forth on the info about fighter bombers during dominion and even though currently they are probably in for a nerf they are pleasing the players without being totaly opwould have been alot easyer to get to if you would have been able to keep up with discussions inside any alliance that has a bunch of them even most alliances that did not own many were discussing it as it would endable them to do stuff that was before not possible which many of them thank you for and many jf pilots would rather hate you for pso yea im all for it to have devs play the game hell i wouldnt care if 20 of you guys working on 00 sov joined a major powerblock and go fiddle with stuff from there just leave your devpowah somewhere else and go grind a few sanctums go on a roam experience a nodecrash because were trying to replicate your trailersoh join fw i beg you
single best idea ever put forward by a csm and im not even jokingyou cant balance what you dont understand and no amount guess work will ever help you get it rightseriously one hundred million hit points you need to come shoot one of these so you know what it feels like
im worried that a lot of players will probably freak out a bit at this but at the end of the day this is necessary given what happened during the t20 scandal i can understand why ccp treads lightly on this issue but its gone too far the other way
support i think that there should be mandatory time at work to play eve for ccp developers liang
in these days of metagaming ip tracking and general all around skullduggery its no wonder a lot of ccp staff stay away from major entities due to the drama it could cause when i spoke to some fellows they were pretty wary about joining eve voice in fw fleets because their voices might be recognizedthe potential fallout from someone finding out and it being publicly revealed that suchnsuch corpalliance has a dev or gm in its ranks even if they were a lowly tower jockey or miner would be a massive source of dramasaying that given the woeful lack of knowledge in some areas displayed by some gmsdevs and the general disconnect that staff have with the actual population of the game i think its necessary for ccp to encourage more staff to get involved in actually playing the game especially in areas in which they are involved in developing you cant hope to sort out problems unless you have experienced them yourself in some degree
i know the devs have made some unpopular changes but this really is a cruel punishment to inflict on them
supported
there are so many ways a dev can insulate themselves from the risk of getting busted that there is just no excuse and add to that the fact that they can get their characters renamed and get a clean slate anyways sure they cant lose anything if they dont play but then they dont have anything in the first placeunless you have a totally outrageous accent or are a girl chances are nobody will recognize your voice i go on peoples comms with my spy alt and talk like normal and nobody recognizes my voice
agreed as a matter of fact if voice recognition is a worry simply use one of the many voicemasking programs available i used one in another mmo for an alt to sort out the root of a bad situation my main was the founderleader of the guild it worked beautifully and i played that alt with voice for a long time and no one ever suspectedi also agree that playing eve should be a mandatory part of the work day for every dev and gm and even some of ccp staff who arent devs all of them should have an account not associated with their actual jobs and all of those accounts should be logged daily into a seperate database where a small staff of maybe two or three people would periodically examine these logs this should be enough to deter or nipinthebud any scandalcausing activitiesthis idea is right up there with the excellence idea and both have my full 110 support
it can couse a lot of problems fe if some dev will get involved in 00 warfare and will do everything in his power so his big alliance stay in power  aka promoting nap fest and blob warfare  titans spam  so no other entities can have any chance whatsoeveralthough its just an example  its not like devs are looking to solve those problems anyway  they love current  boring  static 00 affairs  and big alliances that cant be defited unless disbanded by spy  why this problem is more complicated then what op suggest
i will offer free anonymization services vpn for any dev whod like to play eve again or surf inappropriate content removedapplebabe unimposedwash your ip of that filthy ccp hostname 
ander collecting dev names for a big bust calling it now
it is no secret that armor remote repair systems are much more popular then shield repair ones so let us find out why is that the case generally shield tanks have higher resistances because invulnerability fields are more effective then energized adaptive membranes so theoretically shield tanks should be more effective in a remote rep chain the reason they are not used is the fitting cost fo a shield transporter let us assume that personal reps and boosters are in a good state of balance at the moment large armor repairer 2300 mw  55 tfremote armor repairer 660 mw 48 tfas we can see the remote repair uses both less cpu and vaslty lower amounts of powergrid macking it easier to fit large shield booster 165 mw 115 tfshield transporter 192 mw 154 tfhere for an unknown reason the fitting requrements of the module increase this is unfair towards shield tancking races and forces everyone into a homogenious setup where every rr bs fleet is armor which in my opinion is not goodproposal body i propose that the fitting requirements fo modules are brought more inline either by making shield transporters easier to fit or by macking armor repairers more difficult to fit either way they have to be brought in line so fitting requirements are simular on both modules at the same time modules of all sises have to be looked at because this situation is observed with medium and small units as well for an unknown to me reason there has been large amphasis on the logi ships and i considered this obvious when the cpu reqirements on the large shield transfers arrays are cut the cpu capacity of the scimatar and basilist will be cut accordingly or their bonuces changed to keep all their fitting and power absolutely the sameaccordingly if armor rr reqirements are increased the bonus of onieros and guardian will be increased so fitting these modules still costs exactly the same theirfore this proposal carrier absolutely no change to the logistics ships
what problem would this solve logistics are fine to fit asis you are also comparing large armor repairers bs mods with large shield boosters cruiser mods so your proposal is flawed to begin with
apple meet orange i suggesty ou just ignore maxsim sok hes been posting nothing but trolls
we will have bs rr gangs as well as shield ones which makes it more interesting remote shield reppers are not fitted on anything except logistics ships how is that fine and i am sorry from when on is a large shield booster a cruiser class modulequote from evelopedia i can fit a 1600mm plate on a vexor that does not make it a cruiser class module and i am comparing large shield transfer arrays to large remote armor repair units and their fitting costs if anything you can say its bad but it is not a troll please give a me single reason why shield transfer arrays should be more difficult to fit then remote armor repair units
im sorry you are absolutely right this also explains the xlarge shieldbooster fitted wyvern we killed like two years ago
larges are more battlecruiser modules than cruiser modulesbut i would have imagined by now everyone agreed that fitting requirements of shield transporters cpu to be precise need to be lowered i must say i am genuinely surprised anyone even a csm member is against it also nice useful posts considering you were complaining about other posts not being useful enough is it really too much to ask that a csm member displays some profesionality in assembly hall topics instead of such postsremote armor repair is something you can fit relative easy compared to other high slot modules shield transporters cost half your cpu shield transporters need normal cpu reqs to make rr shield bs gangs viable
even if the general direction of the proposal would be correct the propsal should be based on reasonable arguments and comparing the large shield booster to a large armor rep is a badly flawed argument large shield booster on a bs except for pve fits maybe is just a fail setup

thumbs down this proposal makes no sense from beginning to end starting with the presumption that for some reason shields and armour should be treated the same
same can be said for large armor rep on bs the incorrect assertion that large shield booster is cruiser mod is not a valid reason for rejecting the proposal in itself what does that make of mid and small boosters xl booster is just a counterbalance to 1600mm plate its just an oversized version of noncap modin any case its about shield transporter not local rep those are just trolls attempts to sidestep the issue entirely when they cant find fault its a common if juvenile behaviorblob commanders have real reasons to dislike ungimping the shield transporter it can be summed up as laziness theyre used to armor and are repulsed by changes outside of their comfort zone which can be a scary thing ungimped shield transporters may make some people demand shield rr fleet which is an inconvenience it would also result in lighter faster ships with more transversal than stacked plate fits it would shift blob dynamics away from static turret match the fear is enemy would be well organized and skilled enough to control such a fleet and taking advantage of it and they wontwell assuming lag get fixed eventually
lack of shield spider tanking gangs is evidence enough that rr shield tanking is brokenas gypsio points out the correct way to assess the module is to look at the percentage of resources cpupg the module requires to fitcpu usage on lsts effectivelly force you to gimp your setup in order to fit them lrar do notalso given the impractibility of fitting cap injectors to shield tanked setups lsts should be the more cap efficient modules
you obviously havent looked very hard
and there was me thinking it was the job of csm candidates to evaluate the merits of ah posts just sit back  relax enjoy your free trips to iceland and continue offering value for money to ccp and the players you represent by firing off glib comments and failing at basic maths and resoning  not to mention game experiance
someones power has gone to their head for suregive a real response rather than a snippet of troll with no real argumentur a csm bro act like one
ermwe run rr shield gangs all the time and i know of several other alliances that do so i have no idea wtf you two are talking about a quick look at any major alliances killboard should reveal the same hint you should be looking for scimitars not basilisks
very professionalglad your bias has not gotten the best of you
when i see ravens and tempests fitting shield rr the way that megathrons and armageddons fit armor rr then ill think that shield rr is at the right level yes the scimitar is a lovely ship but shield rr shouldnt just go on scimitars
this is why i love these boards so many stuckup super serious weird people i love being a space councilor that has nothing to do with the fitting requirements of the modules but rather is because rr ships needs their mids for injectors tackle mods and ewar and with a shield buffer this does not work if there were more bs with 7 or 8 mids it would be very different shield logistics and the relevant mods are fine buff shield battleships
show us on the doll where sok touched you
sorkatez you are continuing to give argumnts abosolutely irrelevant to the topick of this proposal this proposal is not about carriers xlarge shield boosters or any personal tanks at all so how is this relevant yes xlarge shield boosters are equivalent of two larges so they are better to fit on a bs we got that either way that does not matter what matters is that for unknown reason life is made harder for those that try to setup rr shield gangs and i cannot see any reason why such unfairness should take place again this is not the problem raised in this proposal if you would like us to make lowslot cap injects is that the problem you are pointing out make a separate thread about it ive seen plenty of shieldtancked ships on the field lately so aparently people have way less issues shieldtancking their ships then you are describing gypsio iii has just demonstrated they are not fine are you simply ignoring everybody else if you want to make an argument sorkatez give me a single valid reason why shield rr should be 34 times more difficult to setup then armor rr
its quite clear you have no idea what were talking abouttry reading the op before you commentwere talking here about spider tanked fleet configurationsyou know bs that have damage and 1 or 2 large rrno one except you is talking about logistic ships
hushhh sanshas are everywhere
i like it as long as my learning skill training gets refunded in some way
they arent doing anything different though you already trained everything by training your learning skills they are still raising their attributes but they are doing it by training skills that depend on themthis is actually less helpful to older players a player who has already maxed their attributes by training the learning skills will have no need for this system theyve already got the attribute bonuses that they would have gotten by training regular skills which depend on attributesjust like apocrypha changed the attribute selection system when you create a character now you no longer pick what skills or attributes you start with to a veteran player this is pointless as weve already gone through that stage but for new players it made things a little more interesting without taking too much if anything away from the game
i find other alternatives to removing learning skills to be more suitablethis system would result in vets getting much better training times than new players as vets often can afford to devote long stretches of time to skills with a single attribute or 2 as now new players need a wide variety of skills across the full spectrum of attributes so could not easily benefit from this instead they would be encouraged to only train certain skills to 5 to maximize learning time before training others which would decrease their enjoyment of the game that is the same argument used against the current learning skills system that it encourages new players to maximize skill training by training skills that are best for them in the long run but make eve a less fun experience in the beginning
just thinking outloud here dont several skills take several weeks even close to a month or sometimes longer to finish with maxed out attributes in the absence of really nice implant buffs as well i mean some skills in eve just take timededication regardless of what system you have in place for learning skills that said training learning skills is a major buzzkill for everyone and i think its a huge drag on new players i know it was for me i also know id like to get those sp points back and spend them in something else if that system was replaced ive heard specualtions that ccp is going to take out learning skills at some pointi also know id like not having to tell new players who vital it is to get their learning skills up to at least lvl4 as soon as possible because the difference is millions of skill points after a long enough period of time and get them to focus on what they really want to do as soon as possible so i support just getting rid of learning skills but im not sure the focused training curve would be helpfulbeneficial than the current system or fun and with the trainingque in place it doesnt really encourage time spent in game either id support replacing it though with a different system than this entirely one that rewarded time spent actually playing eve but preserved much of the passive system so as not to grant instant gratification in advanced skills what id like to see is a series of minigames developed for each attribute that one could do inside the stations giving ccp a reason to actually get incarna finished in my reckoning time in a pod is really taxing on our toons attributes especially when you loose a ship and get podded my thinking is it should be so violent and stressful that when you die your mental preparedness is harmednot just because you lost your shiny implants but also because the process of emergancy cloning and not clone jumping is very violent the effect is when you get podded you go back to a base level of attributes across the board so to combat that and to even give us a major buff in our attributes temporally pod pilots could go do mental exerciseschallenges in stations before boarding their ships again i mean they wake up in a station when they are recloned anyway they would then need to go and do the challenges to raise their attributes to the desired levels and they could focus on just the few they are training at the time additionally one could see nerfing living in your ship practices by having smaller negative effects on your attributes each time you logout of eve for longer than a hour so as to target only intentional logouts in space such as negative 2 point to one attribute at random instead of rebooting them all to the base level this would make real outposts more common and essential to 00 and require posmanageralts to do more than just sit there if they want there skilltraining to move forward at an accelerated pace this effect would also be a huge drawback into the practice of deathpodding jumpcloning on the cheap i know ive done it and i think i would do it a lot less often if there was more than just an isk consequence it would also put real value into every pod and not just the pods that have or may not have implants it would also give the upcoming incarna a unique vital purpose in game play and not just be a graphical walkthrough of the current sidebar menu or platform for roleplay overall i like my idea not because it would make the game easier for anyone but because it would make it harder for older players like me and it would have consequences on actual gameplay
a veteran is someone who has already trained learning skills so someone with learning skills at level 5 already has that advantage just like they do ingame currently just like youll train your learning skills to level 34 before moving onto the next tier simply because the next tier takes 14 days at level 5 its no differentthats power gaming and is something this system is trying to avoid instead of spending time focusing on learning skills that maximise your training times but prevents you from using new ships and equipment now youll just focus on training for the things you want to do eventually the most used attributes will hit their capyou dont have to raise all your attributes why bother raising charisma if youre not trading or using planetary industry if you are training the skills you need will raise charisma enough to meet the cap the implants will give the biggest bonus thats a nice idea but it does deviate heaps from mine mine is more of a simplification of the current system where a lot of the attribute raising happens behind the scenes just short of giving us sp back from learning skills but still enough to keep the learning skills ingame but out of sitethe only problem i see with this idea is the lore would need to be changed a clone is a clone as long as its updated it contains all the neural pathways given by skill training and all the attributes of the previous clone thered need to be a fictional explanation before they could impliment this why are our clones lacking attributes itd certainly add a new dynamic to being pod killed i suppose a simple explanation is that the clone hasnt had a chance to live yet so youre not gaining attributes youre in a sort of rehab to realise those attributes
this is an interesting proposal but i am concerned it has huge balancing issues basically it changes skilltraining rates from linear to acceleratingon the plus side ccp can just reuse the code for ship acceleration with different constants grinon the minus side it will tend to force people to train intensively in particular skill categories to maximize their training time bonuses also it will cause the authors of evemon to have cerebral hemorrhages when they try to rewrite the skill plan optimizeron balance at present i dont think it has a high enough costbenefit ratiothat said tavin i really like the way you were thinking in the op and i look forward to seeing other interesting proposals from you
im not sure if this is a good idea this would require that you have pirate stations in lowsec with pirate fw agents and lp stores lowsec is far safer than npc 00 when it comes to pvp and doing regular missions for pirate factions in npc 00 would become not rewarding and unique enough and thus obsoleteit would be interesting from an rp point of view
it would be pretty pointless to do this if they dont fix fw first add to that they told csm they wont fix fw
yes id like something like this a lotif as some of the replies are correct and ccp wont work on fw i think an alternative would be to simply make standings mean something beyond access to pve agents ok main faction amar caldari etc negative standing has some impact 50 or worse standing you cant dock at that factioncorps station and their stations defences will shoot at you50 or better standings ships of that faction will not attack unless you attack first at least belt and event rats other types would be open to exploits without further changesthese changes would make it so your forced to choose between allying with the pirate faction and using their stations or exploiting the regions resources making it easier for pvp pirate players to operate in npc nullsec vs most big player alliances that currently lay claim to these areas which is really what these factions are about anyway it doesnt make a lot of sense for them to be competing for control of empire space as theyre outlaws there and lore wise too small to really compete with the big empires directly just need to make npc pirate space good bases of operation for pirate players irrespective of ties to existing player alliances
this was actually wehn fw went in something ccp promised but has failed to deliver i say yes expand 00 npc space and encourage it it would fill those markets and so forth but ccp arent focused
 what furb wrote2if you align to one of the pirate factions you will be kos to npc in all of empire and in the npc regions unaligned with your chosen factionsure low sec and 00 arent patrolled by npc so the effect there will be 0 but it will ban you from all of high sec how many players that arent currently at 5 or less are willing to accept that
quoting from an email of ned coker received 8th of july after contacting ccp via emailphonecall snip were done with the initiative while we didnt wrapup things perhaps as nicely as we should haveim having a hard time finding a wrapup our ceo presented a check to the red cross
there was a news item on it just cause you suck at searching doesnt mean they didnt inform us
the news item also said that they were holding the event open for an indefinite period to raise more money did they ever actually close it
they hsould have posted pictures and the sum and proudly announced it instead tehy forgot about it all together common thats just silly
some people in haiti got free gametime presumably
i find the massive sokratesz posting around this issue quite stupid
most of soks recent posts have been relevant to the discussion its a shame that he has to keep making the same points repeatedly because people cant seem to understand them or find it more convenient to disbelieve them in order to support their conspiracy theories
i find the massive amount of blind conjecture and illogical conclusions drawn from it quite stupid to each there own i guess
nope because of the lack of an alternate explanationthis is 2010 and we have the internet there are no secrets if it wasnt related to the csm but the csm knew what it was then one of you would have leaked it anonymously
you keep giving up more information on her expulsion i think we might be dealing with two nda breaches in one weekif youre expelled theres many who wont miss you
meh so no one knows what exactly is it that she disclosedi mean it has to be something big or else ccp wont immediately boot herit also has to be something public because if she just told a few friends ccp wont know about it
facepalmim just doing some damage control for ccp within the limits set out for me given that they failed to properly do it themselves and that loads of weird people keep getting these ed ideas
i did now but if the information is not related to the csm how does an ordinary player get access to nda breaching stuff do ccp mail stuff around at randomand regardless she was in the csm she got kicked from the csm therefore it is related to the csmits a sad situation though for both parties the reason i have a problem with it is that if feels unfair
its not like a novelty or anything
you are right there but i wouldnt agree with the wording of your first bit i agree though that as long as ccp doesnt reveal any other information it feels unfair that i have to fight this fight for them
thank you for your contributions
maybe in your haste to do damage control you have forgot that this is a thread in assembly hall and posting simply to support the proposalrequest is allowed and a normal procedure btw at least half of your attempt to do damage control had the opposite effect
im just posting information if people interpret said information incorrectly thats not my problem some people just want to see things that arent there but it will be a lot easier to convince them or if not that ridicule them with ccp backup
you cant talk about privacy when using someones handle and reallife name in the same paragraph in my very humble opinionccp the csm is about transparency and this was the most attended ballot thus far  if you dont want this to become such a pipe dream and you dont want to dissuade people from voting again please be more transparentat the moment your voters and subscribers dont know what to think certainly many think that the way this has been handled smacks of something untowards going onsimilarly a lot of people are rubbing their hands together and crowing that ankh has been removed from the csm to you i say shame on you ankh was the csm her passion vibrancy and personal sacrifice to the csm should be an example and inspiration to everyoneto those who say that its ok for ccp to be private let me remind you that theyve afaik unanimously removed an elected official what kind of confidence does this give you for anything the csm can or cant do after this anyway she could throw spoons at me any day of the week as long as it got black ops sorted out and meta level in item detail views finally  ccp im not against you if your decision was fair then absolutely fine  im just begging you to show the transparency that you promised and save the csm before this goes too far
big thumbs down to this proposalankh is such an idiot that im not even remotely surprised that she went and blabbed about something shed signed an nda aboutwhy exactly should we expect ccp to tell us info about something theyd had a nda about in the first place to satisfy all you peoples personal curiousityi agree that the csm must be transparent but by all indications this was not something directly related to csm workingsmost notably ccp doesnt owe you they have every right to keep secret inner workings secretthe csm is better off without ankh nuff said
hi lark here you may remember me from such internet political scandals as larkonisgate and well thats it i shall offer some insight having been the only other person thus far to have been removed from the csm although in my case i resignednow chaps youre all rushing ahead here i think a lot of you were slightly spoiled by the way ccp dealt with my misdemeanor for all the hurf blurf it was a relatively minor in game infraction where i was the only beneficiary of said actions and ccp had the advantage of being able to deal with me in person me being cooperative and having the rest of the csm on site to help clean up my mess as none of these conditions appear to have been met going by ankhs quote on massively thats probably the reason youre not getting as much informationive no idea what ankh did and id like to know as much as everyone else transparency is great most of the time but the nda is a srs bsns document and covers a lot of bases if the breach was particularly serious then there are potential rl legal ramifications as such it is going to be in neither partys best interests to go mouthing off about what happenedccp gave a reason that reason was breach of the nda you dont have to like it i for one dont either but like it or not it is more than they are required to tell you this isnt big brother you cant put someone up for a public vote if they foul upps page 3 snipahpps not supported
yet another passive income also eve is primarily a spaceship pvp game and ships are supposed to fly and blow other ships up not stay docked while gathering free isk and manipulating stocks dont turn eve into stock market simulator pleasenot supported
why would ccp ever implement this this is clearly in the realm of stuff players should make
transactions which require trust  collateral in a game of eve players at least require some help from the designers eg banks or image if the players had to rely on their ingame trust for courier contracts it just works so much better with ccpenforced collateralat the very least if there were fw stocks all the authors of the goods i own are in short supply you should buy them asap posts would put their manipulation talents towards joining and dying for my militia is fun and cool what if they even started paying personal bounties to recruit for their corpfactionbesides it does not seem too extensive to implement does not effect lag adds to the diversity of things to do and things to keep you occupied before you unsub
that is inaccurate stock exchanges function because there is oversight they are forced to disclose their financials to have publicly available stock there is no way for players to make this in the game no player organization has the ability to provide that kind of oversight nor the ability to penalize or place functional liens on a company that grabs the money and runs additionally the barrier to exit is nonexistent in eve so most players can within 23 hours close shop and make expensive assets disappear something that is near impossible to do in rl besides unlike rl characters are disposableof course it would be nice to have actual financial reporting tools ingame for ceosdirectors to begin withsomething like the dow could be player created to have that you need an exchange an exchange cannot be player created
first the income wont be a garantee like any stock on the dow jones it remains a gamblewhats so great about this game is that it provides us with different kind of gameplay if you want eve to grow you need to continue to develop the different aspects of this game to provide more choices to the players eve will never turn into a market simulator only a new button in your taskbar might pop up that being said eve has one unique economy going on and its probably making history in the mmo world the dow jones idea will only reinforce that position
yes make ecm less funwrecking please
1 module you mean caldari dont have to fit minmatar gallente caldari amarr mid slot modules you dont have to fill your low slots with boosters so those mid slot modules have a real chance of actually working just stick one module on and everyone magically loses their locks all this time and we could actually fit a tank and guns on ecm ships curse can stick one heavy neut some guns and some tank and turn frigates into dust arazu can point things from the other side of lala land and sensor damp them at the same time so they cant shoot back the huginn oh wait painters and webs lol ill give you the huginn
i like this proposal as it doesnt nerf ecm mods but helps pilots that want to be resistant to ecm at a cost a lot of these proecm guys are big users of ecm huge surprise there eh
after a desync of the server i lost my loki due to ccp not taking evidence of players i need to suck it up and start all over again grinding isk for the lokiso being shot  the gate 115 au out of the mission room as shown on the screenshot isnt sufficiend evidence to prove they ed it up once againscreenshot
yea  it would seem that ccp sees only what it wants to see  the screenshot is absolute evidence  hell you were on a gate 11 au from rats and they still hitting you omg ccp why dont you ever take care of older players you do fine for all the nubs ffs
it might jsut be the server rejecting your fitpassive tanked loki for missions
you can run lvl4 serpentis missions even in a buffer tanked cynabal it just requires basic piloting
that is bizarre did you fill out the customer service survey im reminded of this dev blogalso posting in the thread before it gets lockedkicked from assembly hall
aww thats terriblecan i have your stuff when you ragequit
i dont care about the fit i care about devs not tacking stuff into consideration i have encountered the same bug where ai was shooting me from 25 au away that did not end in anything horrible for me however i just relogged
ccp reimburses ships when the serverscode breaksif serverscode is breaking you cant believe the logs are correct at allfurthermore if the logs show nothing they must by default saying that pic is fake and fraudulent at the same time its a common bug
please
so im flying my ship which has this slot assimilator module this module will remotely take control of a random module of the victimsi tackle a guy but his friend shows up its a close battle but i assimilate one of his modules every so often randomlyhes flying a raven the first module i take control of is his shield booster i turn it off completely next cycle i take control of his bcs not very useful next cycle i take control of one of his weapon systems i start shooting his friend
bump why are we banning use of mwd in missions therifore limiting the fitting options of mission runners i see no reason for this
it makes it faster for pirates to burn over to you then theres direct warp gated deadspace sites
10
if a dramiel drops into a deadspace pocket mwd or ab it is going to catch most things before they can get out
mwd is extremely overly nerfed introduce rats with 2pt scrams and allow mwds to be used in deadspace
i agree i would love to have a grouping object or maybe a module that consumes extra cpu and powergrid so it costs something to be lazy
i definately support this as it will save rl time and not be such a headache this is a game and should be fun not irritating
after going through the pain and wasted hours of rl time picking up items in 100s of stations from regionwide buy orders ive decided to propose a solution that should benefit alli do not want to interfere with the courier contracts and in fact hope this helps couriers haulers and tradersi propose that there be a intrasystem read within a single system npc courier service introduced that will allow players to consolidate items into 1 station in a system once per daythis would allow for playerstraders to consolidate items and therefore create larger packages for couriers hence larger rewards and would still take quite a bit of work to pick up everything if they did not use couriers as travelling to all systems in a region can take several hoursdocking at every station in the region is mindnumbing time consuming and takes alot away from gameplayi believe this would benefit all
and make things easier for the jita stationwarmersno thanks you guys can play the game like the rest of us do
at the moment bookmark management is severely lacking which leads to 3 big issuesbringing up the bookmark window candoes lag out the client even if its minimized every time you open it and for every new system you load i argue this is due to the fact that the client rerequests the whole listing including names system locations details and notes of each bookmark every systemsession changebookmarks are difficult and extremely time consuming to manage and the management we do have available using folders is clientbased so it gets lost if you switch clients home vs work computer for instance and in the case of a reinstalllastly and its not a new suggestion you are unable to search for bookmarks by name only sort by name region number of jumps date created etcmy suggestionsallow a filter to only load current system constellation region or all like assets but it can be a drop down not tabsallow tagginglabeling like the new revamped mail system does so something can be multiple thingsmake the tagginglabeling server side so it doesnt get lostexpand the bookmark typing to be more than just planets moons stations and everything else is a coordinate if i bookmark a control tower it should be typed as a control tower right allow searching by name in bookmark lingo the labela lot of bookmarks are one off just need it to warp back then i dont need it anymore kinda bookmarks add a checkbox on the creation window to mark a bookmark as temporary and have it autodelete after lets say one week this will help clean out the clutter of the thousands of bookmarks im sure the server holds on to and serves up on every client request for all though mission loot bookmarks and bookmarked complexes and anomalies etc
au contraire lowsec is indeed broken  its risk is way too low for its rewardhisec pvp ie war is against forewarned targets who have time to prep for a fight who will choose appropriate hulls and fits and seek allieslowsec piracy is against targets with utter fail fits who are already engaged with rats which dont retarget and who do not gang in numbers of more than pairs even a moderately incompetent pirate should never lose a ship to a mission runner in lowsec ever that unbalanced reward snacky pimpmod loot and killmails as well for no risk is unsupportablethe lowsec environment needs to be changed to mandate against fits which are inappropriate for pvp broadly speaking making missions which are issued for lowsec destination systems similar to fw very short duration and not designed for bss and changing rat behaviour additional spawns upon warpin of new ships and retargeting on the fly will bring the risk that pirates face back into the same ballpark as that of nullsec lagfests and hisec wardecs
your basic assumption is wrong i mean yeah lowsec has almost the same risk as 00 with multiple unconquerable npc real stations per system not those tiny instant kickout player built outposts limited on one per system and occasional small roaming gangs instead of regular 00 50 hac fleets also in lowsec there are no anchorable bubbles dictor bubbles heavy interdictor bubbles or bombswh dont have less risk than nullspace  no local and no regional intel channels for example sure its less populated but that doesnt mean its less dangerousmissions in nullspacealso you forgot about factional warfare missions and complexes in lowsec  loads of lps unique faction items and ships in lp stores more than decent faction standing boostthe rest of your suggestions are the same as nerfing nullspace since youve obviously never been in 00 let me be the first to inform you that bs spawns are not regular in most of the nullsec especially in higher truesec systems the belts in lowsec should not contain the rarest ores that are reserved for 00 belts you are suggesting that even lowsec must have abc ores while 90 of nullspace dont have it again check ore distribution based on truesec besides if you want rare ores in lowsec scan for gravimetric sites  they are safer than belts anywaystanding loss is there to passively protect nonpirates and punish pirates and it works as intendednot supported
i am not talking about fw lowsec but the rest of lowsec indeed fw places are ok i guess but ive never done fw so whateveri am currently in nullsec this is an obvious alt i have seen mostly western nullsec npc as well as sov space i have had good spawns everywhere ok ok i was in good constellations and i do know truesec matters a lot i know abcs are not everywhere in 00 but yes making them available in lowsec makes lowsec more attractive to miners than 00 unless theyre in an alliance or some alliances petsahh whatever i just thought the ore thing was a nice solution to tears p
i dont see why youre opposed to making probing ships more difficult i do a lot of probing have a near max skilled alt for it and guess what i think its way too easy i can probe out anything but a frigate in seconds im experienced and know what im doing most are not as fast but its still overpowered and makes ninja missioning basically impossiblean alternative is to give missions a masking effect they actually had this prior to the current probing system it was more or less impossible to probe someone with the combat probe equivalents instead you had to use sensor type specific ones that only had a 2au range even then it was hit and miss if this masking effect were reintroduced it may very well make ninja missioning a viable option again the only problem with it is it would also make it very easy to make an unprobable ship so long as its in a missionin any case low sec missioning will not expand unless the ability to probe out missioners is nerfed in some way ive given two ways to do this without breaking anything both are very reasonable and i make these suggestions as the hunter not the prey
so why hasnt it been done yet
its on the backlogyou can be sure that i will continue pushing for it as soon as csm5 has proper access to said backlog
an unnecessary change that may cause more bugs when there are so many other things that desperately need fixing epeen is just that nobody is impressed anyway
but but my mom always compliments me on my epeen
has there been a status update on the backlog list since iceland
no but improvements in that area should be made before we go to iceland again in december
when right clicking a on a charecters avtar the menu drops down the positioning of show info and start conversation are frustratingly close i know this is a small issue in the grate scheem of things but one that i think easly fixed by spacing them apart and make acidental convo invites a thing of the past
either that or or a popup dialog that lets you confirm that you want to convo someoneanyway all drop down menus in game need a massive overhaul
or you could just double click the pilots name
oh gods this means nobody knows where their towel ishow can we be hoopy froods without our towelssupported this is a catastrophe
im only wearing a towel right now
supported because the op is a hoopy frood and we should all know where our towels are
100 support this idea
dont try to fix something that isnt broken your request is pointless at this moment
on the other hands i bet 80 of the trolls would dissapear not so much of a bad thing
the link below says it all
want this one so bump
dosnt seem like you understand that part at allbecause you keep pushing for ccp to reveal information under nda as to why ankbrokethenda got booted
thats not the information im asking for or are you saying the entire situation is under nda so we have to be left in the dark about the entire set of events
your summary is inaccurateid love to be wrong i genuinely hope i am wrong as im not one of the eve is dying brigade but theres been a lot of bad ju ju around recently and this csm stuff smells real fishy too the question remains will ccp fix the under lying problems or wont they i cant really see how the csm saying to the player basewe know but we cant tell you is any better than ccp saying to the player basewe know but we wont tell you my gut feeling is that this amounts to the suppression of bad news for long term players rather than ccp being keen not to spoil a wonderful surprise whatever your colleague revealed if this has been documented on another website can someone provide a link is probably not related and ccp have every right to protect their business of course but why involve player representatives in the development secrets of the company if these very representatives have no real ability to influence the product development policy its like a man who makes fireworks telling his children where he keeps the matchesif the player representatives do have the ability to influence product development policy then why are ccp not getting the message fix what we have already a brilliant but flawed game before you make anything new well maybe this ccp has to chase the dollar because thousand of people within the game are not paying to play it as they cheat the system to generate iskhow many 00 alliances now systematically use python injection to modify the client to keep pace with all the others who are at it they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely un policed how many people use bots they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely unstoppableif you were ccp would you want to fix lag for these people they cheat the game so they dont have to pay for itthe massive greed of players who have sought to exploit the game for their own ends has meant that their opinions now count for nothing on the other hand a day old noob is the guy that all the content is being developed for because his monthly subscription pays the wagesnew players bring in dollars without any preconceptions about the current state of the game new players are attracted by marketing marketing in turn must have a shiney to market so ccp are forced to regularly build said shiney to attract new players maintainingoptimizingupgrading a former shiney is not marketing news in 6 months time ccp wont be launching a huge campaign for new players on the basis oflook we cured the lag beast in a game youve never played before you know that sim city thing on planets weve made it work better hey we know you dont know what rockets are but we fixed em hence dust hence incarna
so you understand that she was kicked for breaking the nda and you want ccp to disclose what exactly in the nda sh broke thereby disclosing to you the information they did not want disclosed anything she said or did that was not a violation of the nda is not relevant due to the obvious well not obvious to everyone i guess
1 further revelations regarding the nda breach may increase the risk that the information that was exposed could be exposed to a wider audience we do not know the circumstances of the breach  this is true however as we do not know those circumstances we can hardly judge what is and isnt appropriate for ccp to disclose to us about the breach i think this may be called a catch 22 situation2 as i suggested earlier the situation may have moved beyond the scope of the nda  there may now be other external factors being considered by ccp and eva jobse  significant ones
thanks for explaining that cobalt it makes more sense i still dont like being left in the dark but if it isnt possible im not going to pursue it im just too used to rl authorities keeping things secret that have no business being kept from the public
not necessarily there are plenty of reasons why companies will not and absolutely must not divulge information for example there are rules around how companies recognize revenues after disclosing information related to future projects im not an accountant so i dont know the exact rulesremember ccp is a company and it also has rules it has to follow the nda isnt just about keeping information secret for pr or marketing purposes its also about following corporate law
your summary is inaccuratesnipped a few linesccp has to chase the dollar because thousand of people within the game are not paying to play it as they cheat the system to generate iskhow many 00 alliances now systematically use python injection to modify the client to keep pace with all the others who are at it they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely un policed how many people use bots they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely unstoppableif you were ccp would you want to fix lag for these people they cheat the game so they dont have to pay for itthe massive greed of players who have sought to exploit the game for their own ends has meant that their opinions now count for nothing on the other hand a day old noob is the guy that all the content is being developed for because his monthly subscription pays the wagesnew players bring in dollars without any preconceptions about the current state of the game new players are attracted by marketing marketing in turn must have a shiney to market so ccp are forced to regularly build said shiney to attract new players maintainingoptimizingupgrading a former shiney is not marketing news in 6 months time ccp wont be launching a huge campaign for new players on the basis oflook we cured the lag beast in a game youve never played before you know that sim city thing on planets weve made it work better hey we know you dont know what rockets are but we fixed em hence dust hence incarnaplaying the game by purchasing plex does bring ccp the cash regardless every penny of it if you pay with creditcard or plex it doesnt matter to ccp but i have to agree with you on the last part the new stuff new players dont care for old bugs simply because they dont know about them unlessthey are gamebreaking say makes the game crash constantlywhich it seems fleet fights seem to do but new players arent involved in those right off the bati dont know about you but i research my mmos before buying the game tech support forum and general forum is the first place i go to in any mmo before purchase after that gameplay
this is a common missconceptionyes all plex comes from real world spent money so ccp is not losing isk to plexwhat people fail to appreciate is that as older players switch to plex and newer players are the major buyers of plex this creates a situation where ccp has to chase new subscribers for cashflowat the expense of having a game worth playingthis is likely the reason all the expansions are pure hype for wow kids and we have gone so long without fixes
which leads into the question would ccp be more willing to put money into fixing long term bugs and less into flashy but largely unwanted expansions if the long term customers were willing to either go back to paying subscriptions or at least have the price point of plexs artificailly shifted so that ccp werent so reliant on new customers buying themif youre not actually paying towards the running of a game then why should you have any say in how it should be runthis of course this makes the csm even more laughable and most likely irrelevant in the eyes of ccp as they represent mainly these nonpaying users instead of the new players who do pay
at some point based on the actual incident as well as the drama its created ccp has to decide whether the csm brings more benefit vs liabilitylooking more and more like its just too much hassle with so little returnkb
the only misconception is your ownplex are the product of gtcs or brought from ccp these costs real life money iraspective if you pay for the game via subscription or plex ccp still gets payed in real money now the more newer players the odds are they will by extra gtcs to sell and that makes plexs cheaper plexs can only get into the game one way and thats from real moneyi hope that explains it if not have a good think about it do some research and get back to us on the forums here remember if nobody sold plexs then there would be none available to buy ingame and the only way to get them ingame is to pay ccp either directly or via one of there agents to obtain a gtc ccp get payed no matter what dont you worry about that
yes plex is a supply and demand market amazing observationsupply comes mostly from new subscribersdemand comes mostly from old subscribersseeccp has control over supply also with the plex monthly limited quotawithout the internal numbers its impossible to say my speculation is that most plex purchasers are new subscribers and thus ccp is aware that these new subscribers are key to their cashflowif new users dried up then plex may dry up then youd see exactly what youre talking aboutthis would force the old users to buy their subscriptions or pay an ever increasing price from tradersuntil this point the cashflow comes from new users regardless of who is spending the plexhowever with ccp chasing new subscribers exclusively with each expansion you wont see this as youve observed
fyi i doubt ccp deliberatly control the price of plex as an intention its mearly a side effect of them selling there product to new customersi think we shall leave it there as were tangenting way to much for me to carry on this discussion and its late but ask yourself what point your tring to make and does it realy matter and if so perhaps start a thread related to that issue were it would be more appropriatly discussed by the masssnow sing after me ding dong the witch is dead
this is my favorite thread ever personal attack removed
okay first off from a legal standpoint they probably cant discuss the matter further or exactly mention what event broke the nda european laws in general are much more strict than american law on matters of privacy why they dont just come out and say that and stop the speculation i dont know the initial statement probably should have included a statement about due to counsel from our legal department we can make no other commenton the matter of the csm basically waste of time just like swg senate was pre nge and pre cu in truth development companies do whatever they want regardless of input from players it is just a touchy feely process meant to make you feel good such a representation is not sufficiently large enough to base any major game decisions on lets just hope that ccp is not being like soe and going to focus groups that never played the game so that they wreck it down the linethe ones that really want to go and do it are probably not the best representatives much like politicians typically dont represent their constituents adequately it takes a certain amount of narcissism to desire such positions which often is at odds with the common man
okay now go back and read the first line in your own and same postyou have essentially answered your own question also it is a little bit over a day now since the news broke perhaps the people directly involved are still discussing things at the glacial pace that is real life
yes the question is how and when its a matter of prioritization were competing for scarce resources what i described is that weve made progress in getting an equalbetter footing in competing for them the difference is that nobody currently sitting on the csm have been fanboiswe all love the game but most of us have been vocal critics of ccp both on the forums and during face to face meetingsas such if you dont trust ccp you have however every reason to believe usso theres things we cant say but we can say what we think about it to ccp and to youexemple 1 vuk lau and i bashed the gms during csm 3 pretty hard about competence consistency fight against macroers etc check the minutes if these same people tell you now that the data we have shows conclusively that there has been a huge improvement and were happy with what we see on all those fronts you have every reason to believe usexemple 2 we cant tell you what the next expansion is going to be about we can tell you we think it has the potential of being awesome we can also tell you we dont think that is where resources should have been focused we have the ability to influence the development policy to an extentits always a balancing act i can understand that ccps objective may lean more towards getting new players than the existing players care aboutccp understands that if were unhappy about the game we dont stay to play itwere there to talk about where the middle ground should be and what those things are that we care about when talking of improving the game as it isthey are report them gms ban them regularly whether they are connected to rmt or not weve advised the gms to make their efforts known and theyre doing so regularly to quote a big report
count to ten and calm downno need to attack every posting you dont understand immediatelythe requested behavior was to say for legal reasons we cannot discuss exactly which event caused a breach of the agreed nda not to deliver a detailed report on what happenedits about saying that something will not happen instead of just not letting it happenpeople have it easier when they know why something is the way it is
i think thats a bit shortsightedwhat reason is there to trust youjust because you did not agree with everything ccp diddoeswe know csm members were selling their influence for plex using insider knowledge to profit personally violate ndasis that the basis on which we should unconditionally trust the csmbut how is that different from the messages we get from ccp directlythey always say the next expansion is going to be awesomethey always say things are improving in the long runand the idea that resources should be put somewhere else is the whole point of the whole commit to excellence thread in the assembly hall the number of supporters speaks volumesso really which additional information does this provideedit fixed some failed quoting
good riddance ankahasapeemapetilon i hope ccp chooses to pursue legal action against you as fervently as you wanted to punish people in internet spaceships
violation of the nda can be anything from a small indiscretion to a fellow eve player about some coming feature to full blown industrial espionage the farther it goes to the latter the less likely we are going to get any more accurate information on it at least until it got wrapped up and dealt with if ever we may read about it in the news if its big enough albeit that is unlikely
i wonder if the trouble she has gotten into might have something to do with the content of her portfolioif you recall there was an advert during the pvp tournament calling for more women to apply for a job at ccp perhaps she overshared information thats never happened before from her current employer to her prospective new employerit would certainly explain why she was dropped so quickly and why it would be in ccps best interests to avoid looking connected to her and to avoid public knowledge of what she has donereally it would mean that anything that comes out in the future that hints at possible plagiarism would be grounds for a court casei could be wrong thoughthen again she went so far as to consider a position on the csm as defacto working for ccpis if so hard to imagine that she wanted to bring her a game to a job interview
ang kah sen tah pem kaheasy 
nobody can cheat the system and play for free each and any plexlicense was paid with real and existing money at some point it doesnt matter the slightest if people generate isk from nothing because they can only use these isks to buy plexlicenses which were bought from ccp at some pointalso conversely like several other posters hinted at it its also a misconcept that the influx of new players is the only thing that keeps the cashcow running and hence fancy new stuff is the thing to do older players buy these plexes if older players leave the game due to annoyingly never fixed bugs and general problems the demand for plexes will decline drastically which then again creates a situation at which injecting new plexes into the market is a mute point because you get next to no isks for them due to too many plexes on the marketand even if theres a lack of massive numbers of new subscribers that also means that there will be less plexes on the market forcing some of the odler players who can not or do not want to win in the plexpricerace have to actually pay the monthly fee and its usually those older players that will not leave the game easily because theyre simply very attached or even addicted to it contrary to newcomers
thats funny csm has no fanbois err you do know ank was the only one not elected by block voters right trusting people put in buy macro ratting 00 alliances which always claim theres no macro ratting in 00 is probably the best joke i have heard this year
has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like
funny that people claim only candidates with block vote support will get into csm but decline to provide any evidence every round of elections people claim the large 00 alliances will take over the csm and it still hasnt happenedwithin csm5 vuk and sok are the only two full delegates who represent large alliance blocks additionally look at the large alliances who failed to get any candidates into even the alternatesmany of us come from smaller corps or alliances and picked up votes based on our reputation and policies not some 00 block voter conspiracy sure people like mynxee strong supporter of lowsec and piracy korvin russian speaking and deirdra eveuni are well respected plus he was chair of csm3 have large numbers of supporters but they are certainly not put there by 00 macro ratting alliances
actually all you had to do was read csm results and the posts leading up to it to see that tea as i have 2 alts in null alliances even the ones that try and stop macro ratting its still happening sorry your not from a small corp or alliance a small corp is 10 people and under but i will admit this so far your the only one i have seen posting common sense to bad rest of the csm except korvin who i dont know and have seen little of so have no clue do not share your ability sad part is first couple i voted got friends out to vote then we realized it was all a joke and it got worse instead of better most are like max or sok they post so much bs its like watching jerry springer
you still have not provided any evidence and in fact i have debunked your claims to block voting several times already but dont let that stop you
my only comment would be this as the csm are representatives of the eve player base and a significant portion of at least those who are posting here are interested in getting more information its quite baffling to me that i cant really see any effort from any of you to reflect that desire and at least enquire about whether more information can be releasedyeah i know most of us didnt really like ankh and theres more people happy with the outcome than arent but the whole csm being nothing but a ccp mouthpiecedistractionpr stunt issue would be quite easily put to bed by something as simple as publicly calling for more info so far the response seems to be good thing done by slightly obfuscated methodah well live with it however it was done i sort of think thats you guys failing at your duty
report them we have evidence that the gms do take actions against those it may take some time to investigate where their money goes so ccp can kill the money distributors instead of playing whackamole with money generators but they get dealt withalso the argument that the csm is controlled by large 00 entities is demonstrably falsea number of candidates from smaller corpsalliances have made it through and a number of people running under the banner of large alliances have failed to get inamong the alliances who failed to get in ill namesystematic chaos goonswarm under its new name bob well it xdeathx legiunea romana razor cult of war intrepid crossing voltron etcwho got in in their placetrebor from initiative mercenaries dierdra vaal from eveuni ubercarebear ankhe teadaze from agony me from rnk mynxee from noir thats just for this election same thing happened during the previous oneseither way its up to people who vote to elect who gets in if people cant be bothered to vote it stands to reason that the people who do vote get electedwell if hes not i am i got elected in csm 2 alt and 3 main while being in a 4 member carebear corp i joined rnk which is not in 00 and cannot be considered a big alliance and got in csm 4 alt and 5 main as well that enough of an exemple to youwhat you mean is that we dont share your point of view and have the balls to sometimes have a critical opinion about thingsits getting a bit tiresome the general bashing attitude on the forums i understand that the humain brain is limited to easily being able to pick between 2 choices but life is not as black and white and theres arguments for and against everything even when you generally think its more white than black or the other way around
should we know anything we wouldnt be able to say being bound by the same nda ankhe brokealso this is a breach of contract between ccp and eva we have little say in the matterif you think none of us reflect the general desire to know more you havent read all we said because we would like ccp to be able to say more however they cant or wontcontract breaches are sensitive matters should it be information related ccp may not want to reveal the information that was hidden and should remain hidden in the first place in addition to which it may lead to lawsuits from one side or the other therefore ccp is most likely not at liberty to say morewhatever it actually was you can guess the severity of the offense by comparing the statements issued for larkonis and this one and therefore the difference in information disclosed theres definitely improvements that are possible in the amountquality of information released and weve asked for those clarifications but thats up to ccp
there is a simple answer we cant discuss csm  ccp communications publicly unless ccp release the information it is nda end of the best i can do is assure you the csm are very unhappy with the situation and with being left without any public clarification from ccp as to the nature of the breach
first thanks for the reasoned reply im genuinely not trying to stir anything up so i appreciate not getting assaulted with fireim well aware of what goes on around ndas i used to create about 20 of them a week for a publishing company i worked with a while back quite accurately they do prevent you from disclosing some things  and i wouldnt want you to im not calling for you to reveal things im calling for someone to ask ccp to give at least some kind of information rather than accepting their blanket statement that they will say nothing of any sort to anyone ever that shouldntcant be an nda violation youre only asking a question put it this way  ccp have been terrible at fulfilling their word in the past with regards certain things like server logs lag etc i have a lot more reason to trust the word of the csm than i do ccp and at the moment all we have is ccp removed ankh from the csm for something or other that happened a while ago with nothing to support this at allmy main concern through this is not ankhs reputation position or in fact anything to do with what happened its that i see this rendering the csm nonviable in that it tarnishes the reputation too much the bold bit in the quote is where i think the problem is to be honest we would like  we have asked and i see no evidence of the latteredit thanks teadaze also theyd moderate it to death quicksharpish probably but wouldnt simply creating a thread indicating what youve said above and observing the ccp nonresponse shield the csmasorganisation not the people from potentially detrimental reputation effectssecond edit ok i just spotted your last line where you said youd asked for clarification im somewhat happier
your point is well taken teadaze even so this is perhaps the first indication that the csm has been in dialogue about this issue may be developing a position on the matter or has expressed its concerns to ccp none of us would require you to violate your nda that does not mean you should avoid proactive communication with the players about your efforts on this front many of us would appreciate that delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
let me just clarify thenwe have asked ccp to provide more information before the announcement was made and have requested it again a few times together or separately the latest request having been made as recently as 4 hours agoim not too worried about the impact on the csm as a whole for this instance should it be cause for issues wrt csm as a whole it would already have happened and as far as i know it hasnt so its clearly a ccp vs eva thing not ccp vs csm
thank you meissa your reassurance that this issue has been raised is pretty much what i was looking for as such i rescind any comments about you not doing your duty as csmi wasnt actually referring to ccp vs csm i was referring to csms reputation with the player base or at least the part that pays attention 
have you thought about players vs csmit appears some of the communication patterns of ccp are slowly growing into the csm as wellit takes a couple of postings and questions until someone will say well we already did that a couple of times we just didnt say it  oh btw results will come soon
thank you meissa that is the kind of action communication and information the playerbase needs and expects from the csm i hope you guys keep us up to date
ah rightso basically blogged what we already knowthat ccp dont give a toss about the csm doesnt listen and is just a jokeone thing about ccp i have seen over the years is that it does not care about its community at alleva is rightly pointing out the problems with ccp and the csm but as usual ccp are as corrupt as hell and try sweep stuff under the carpetget rid of csm cos in ccp eyes it means nothingenough said reallycomplete waste of time and my personal trust in ccp as nose dived alot in the past few yearsthe game is ok sadly the company isnt
i have no problem myself with not getting all the information i would like to have on this frankly because we all know a large majority of that is just pure nosinesshowever it seriously disturbs me that ccp just suddenly kicks a member of the player elected csm the representitives of the player base interests without any further insight other than claiming she broke the nda im not looking for them to tell the entire player community what she did to break the nda im looking for them to tell the csm who is all under that same nda and thus there shouldnt be a problem as i see it sharing that information with who can then relate to us the simple words of yes it was a perfectly legitamite reasonwe voted you in we trusted you to fully represent our interests if ccp can show you it was legite and you can assure us it was then okay im happy as im sure most others would be as it stands now though this event has caused a major shakeup in the players opinions and confidence in the csm which i would say is really the more important issue here
originally by teadazewell just as a question why you dont go then to ccp and simply tell them okay ccp thats the facts it was a democrativ election and you booted a person without to state a reason but because this is a democratic elected council tell the ppl please the reasons so they can decide for themself if you are act in the spirit of the players or just because of the base of rumors and let them decide or we simply step all back from csmhey really you are elected from players to stand for the player issues come on show some democrativ spirit the fundamentel idear behind a democrativ system a democratic system that boots simply a elecated person  no matter the reason and dont wanna say the public why is not better as a fascism regime or a dictatorship so come on csmUFFFDs stand for a democratic way that would be my suggestion what you do or not do is your choice if you want to simply accept the kind of ccp is handling this situation well then itUFFFDs the question if there was a real break or somethin else free informations thats the fundament of democracy even in this case anything else isnt democractic and pls dont say this cant be compared because it is not a democratic way how ccp it handles and it isnt the way that the csm was supposed to beand we all should never forget that it was in the first place ccp devoloper personal who cheated in the game and openly told it the people when they was caught and that this was the reason in the first place to initiate the csm programm so somethin like that couldnt happen anymore and the trust would come back now ccp is doing the exact oppositea csm member that was know for her kind not to agree in all things how ccp handles it and to open resiste agains some of ccpUFFFDs decisions was booted without givin the people who voted her to give reasons if she have really break the nda people deserve to know it how she did it otherwise i for my part would simply belive that ccp wanted to get rid of a csm member and booted her for any reason that nobody knows like a dictator would shoot the people who try to tell the rest of them that there goverment is a cruel one in that spirit the spirit of free information the foundation of the democracy and the main idear behind the csm program that works like a democracy you csmUFFFDs should resist tell ccp you will step back if they dont tell the ppl who elected you what excatly happend ccp dont even need to say that she told somebody a special secret or else or to name it they just need to say whats the situation like we have evidence that person xy has broke the nda and give informations to a other software company or somethin like that if she really have broke the nda itUFFFDs ccpUFFFDs good right to boot her if notand ccp cant prove itand booted her only because of a rumor without hard evidancethe rest you can think yourself if you read the postei just say dictatorshipchereyoquen
1 they did state a reason breach of nda2 ccp is a private company and they have the right to run their company however they jolly well please maybe sometimes that sucks for us players and maybe things would be better if they would fix the things that the csm says they should fix but that doesnt change the fact that they own eve they run eve and at the end of the day all decision making will fall to them including firing a volunteer who breached a contract3 they certainly do not need to tell us the circumstances of the nda breach first that would defeat the purpose of the nda in the first place that is keeping upcoming stuff a secret second you have no real reason to know despite spouting off about democracy and dictatorships like youve just gotten out of political science i ccp doesnt have to indulge your desire for gossip and nosiness
people seem to forget the csm only has real power in the same sense that we have real intrenet spaceshipsits a hobby for ccp when they have the time to dedicate to it theyll be happy to play along and actually listen to the csm theyll even bring it up as part of eves fiction from time to timebut when stuff like this happens the breaching of an nda contract by a member of a group such as csm who has close connection to ccp themselves suddenly eve has to take its place for what it really is a videogame because for ccp this is as far as we know a very serious real world matter that they need to attend toto all the people hounding the csm to be our voice get information from ccp just quit it ccp is having to deal with a very real world problem right now and as such the csm has taken their place alongside you as just other game players until ccp is confident and happy that they can talk about itfrom the get go the csm is only your voice when ccp has the time to listen they are not a second entity themselves that can bash heads with ccp when you feel you need something addressed so for the love of god sit back relax and just wait its been what 2 days are you guys really that impatientcmon hulkageddon has just started go enjoy yourselves for the week forget your troubles and blow ships up have some fun and this will be dealt with before you know itwonders how good of an idea it is to bring up hulkageddon in a topic about ankh
csm isnt reall that useful anymore next time all my votes are going to cato ninetails
i dont agree that theyre not useful i just think everyone thinks they can do more than they canpeople want the csm to march up to ccp and do what they consider to be fixing things ccp is not going to do as the csm say not even close but it does give ccp something to think about if something interest is brought up to themfor some reason people seemed to think that after this csm was formed that ccp would honestly scrap their current plans as a business just to fix things for people is a bit short sighted on the part of csm voters
sorry to say but i hate your frog i simply do not feel as if im fitting in until i declare my hatred for something sadly i am more familiar with frogs than i am with any of the current csm and i find it hard to hate somebody i know little aboutnow on to the topic of empire dwellers such as myselfdont assume we are all of the same mindset or motivation simply because we choose to remain in high security space we all pay to play this game and we all care enough to deserve equal respect when it comes to our views on the future of eve in 06 i lived in 00 as part of the ascn with the merchant marines after that period we went to kos and not long after i became ceo of the corp i handed the reigns off to another player due to time constraints on my end eventually i ended up back in the npc corp dcmi and this is where i have remained for just over a year nowsurprisingly enough ive been having a blast i enjoyed 00 quite a bit but have enjoyed helping new players in dcmi even more i often run into other former ascn members that are in the same boat as myself and have also decided to remain in empire for the time beingankhesentapemkah secured so many votes because she concentrated on garnering the respect of hisec players who normally are all but ignored during csm campaigns in doing so she ended up being favored by a large number of players who likely wouldnt have voted at all under normal circumstances i however did not vote for the queen of spoons due to some of her off kilter remarks about player pirates and her volatile nature when dealing with those who did not share her views ive never had anything against players who choose to plunder and pillage they pay to play the game just as i do and have every right to do so in whatever way they enjoy most in all honesty i doubt the game would be nearly as fun without having to look over my shoulder and be paranoid but thats neither here nor there despite not voting for her myself i can see why others did its just a shame that she had to be such an unstable individual its worth pointing out that with the numbers she brought in you can be sure that other empire dwellers will be encouraged to step forth as potential csms in the next election with that in mind it would be foolish for any future candidate to ignore the high security voters
whathow can you in one single discarded sentence manage to say the csm is useless and next csm your going to vote for so in so the king is dead long live the king  logic does not apply hereindeed if ccp were to stop the csm i highly suspect you would be one of the first to complain about thatask yourself this  if there was no csm would we the players be better of than we are now then when you have worked out that the answear is no then my son you will be a manbut all this lambasting of the csm based upon a tabloid headline fact filter is utterly insulting to not only the current csm members but also those who stood before them do some research see how much effort they put into it its not just a holiday far from itif you care about the csm you will apprecieate what they do achieve and not judge them about a persons shortcommings if you wish to do that go watch big brother be right up your street that would otherwise accept the facts and move on if the person involved posts elsewere about what happened in more detail then im sure ccp will enlighten us to more of the real facts either way it dont change a thingbut all these pages discussing what somebody broke a rule that shouldnt of been broken realy is that simple after all no need to taint the other csms in the same brush out of ignorance now is there
now thats the type of post i like to see
1 breaching a nda is not a good enough reason to remove someone from a position of representation if she did it while performing a function as csmmember its acceptable that she stays if she did it for personal gains then she should be send away ccp is smart enough to make a newsitem giving enough information that we can be satisfied that the latter happened but they didnt2 the do not have the right to manage the company how they want they are bound by consumerlaws for example a part of the service they are offering is democratic playerrepresentation and they have removed this service for a part of the players without decent explanation according to most eu consumerlaws they must reinstate this service or provide partial refund since a democratically chosen playerrepresentation is a discriminating feature of eve with respect to other mmo the applicability of the small print eula is limited
has ahnk been reinstated yet
i guess this is what people mean when they speak of a quality reply thanks p
agh
god i hate you peoplesince ccp says ankh did something bad and ankh says she didnt isnt it possible that ccp has a general say nothing order on this until theyve sorted out the details
what the  are you talking about breach of nda is a ing perfect reason to dismiss a volunteer from a volunteer position at a privately held company and to top it all off were talking about eva jobse not ankhsemimpossibletotypebullname when people google eva jobse who works in game development at another game studio they see broke ndaand in case the ramifications of that dont slap you across the face with a 10 ton hammer ccp just ruined her career she currently works at another game development company and in all likelihood will lose that job over this nda breach furthermore she now has two employers that just dropped her for nda breach and googling her even a little will reveal this enormous scandal of nda breach and thats neglecting the fact that game developments a pretty small world and the name eva jobse just became mudso now weve established that eva jobse has legal damages that ccp is liable for if this is something as petty as player politics so what in the hell would make ccp take that kind of legal risk  worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and at least as much in damages if they lost almost certainly they wouldnt single out one of the many csm candidates that blogged equivalently well maybe theyd do this over a real mother ing nda breach oh and what would any lawyer say dismiss and shut the  upliang
i also support keeping missions in highsec and i live in empirethanks and take caretamber
if i apply for a job can i put internet spaceship warrior in my previous employment record
can and should are totally different things i wouldnt and i assure you that im a much larger forum warrior than you are  your comment also seems to neglect that this is a real problem for her real life ccp would be terminally brain dead to do this without proof of an actual nda breachliang
long time lurker new poster but i have to echo liangs sentiments are you people really that obtuse ccp said she broke the nda she said she didnt and would post an update on her website guess what she hasnt and she also hasnt responded here except through alts which leads me to believe that her main account or accounts ccp know about have also been banned things arent looking so good for old ank from the rational thinking persons standpoint and by rational thinking person i mean anyone with an iq of at least 50 so everybody defending her and calling for ccp to explain please shut the hell up or at least try to make arguments that make sense and are logically consistent
and tamber is very involved in the eve community through her lotteries and other special events i had a blast during the full metal jacket competition tamber is also very friendly and not anywhere near the polarizing figure that ankh is if people want high sec representation tamber is the way to go
i dont know what kind of police state you live in but you should seriously look at applying for political assylum somewhere else even england would be an improvement on your current situation criminal charges for an nda breach thats a matter of civil law in any halfdecent country were ccp to take this to court theyd be looking at monetary damages
hopefully it does end up in court though if for no other reason than the substance of the breach would most likely become a matter of public record through discovery
i concede the point that the matter going to court would fuel countless more weeks of trolling drivel and stupidity on the forum further i suspect it would grafity a number of forum users who spend far too much time worrying about this crap and not enough time worrying about whats really important blowing up internet spaceships and eating pie especially the pie because thats available even when you get gankedplease get your priorities right peopleremoved an unnecessary comment zymurgist

exactlyi honestly cant believe that people are so stubborn or annoyed that ccp is not telling them what is going on or that they think its wrong and ankh should be reinstated because i for totally srsly voted for her and they take away my votepeople just arent realising that there is way more to this then their internet spaceship sense of entitlement it is nothing to do with anyone exept for ccp and ankh they will sort this out in the mean time everyone should be focused on their own persuits in eve and not on other peoples real life businessliang we need to cut up your brain into little bits and share it among those less fortunate
hey the initiative plus its suballiances have 3486 members and after i promised them all exotic dancers and livestock they came out in force for me just so you know the cost of buying the votes of an entire alliance is about 100m iskiestrebor a stripper in every pod daehdoow
added you
ccp is either brain dead arrogant or they have the proof we can all speculate but i dont think we will hear much on this for the reasons you outline above the way this is panning out it will effect her real job so she can likely prove real economic loss and therefore she would have a real libel claim all this means everyone involved will likely shut up eva jobse or no jobse that is the question but really based on what ccp has already posted its likely her game design career is up even if she can prove libel so i guess its eva no jobsetrolling removed zymurgist
well ankh didnt update her blog about it as was announced so there seems to be a good reason to keep quiet about details not only on ccps side
if its relevant to the job description i would say yeswhen asked about mentoring or leadership experience i happily list out not only voluntarily teaching people math programming and writing managing small tactical groups of programmers and support staff but also my experiences with scheduling maintaining order training leadership responsibilities and arbitrating arguments in uo eq wow eve warhammer planetside quake clans mechwarrior clans daoc cod clans etc i just realized this list is way longer than is reasonableone interesting thing is to point out how it is a lot easier to get people to do what you want them to do irl because you have the conventional carrots and sticks i would love to see your average midlevel cubicle commander exert the force of personality and organization required to get 10 25 40 100 or 500 people online at the same time across different timezones with varying skill levels ages and availabilities then have them be committed to a goal and achieve it they should give out honorary phds in organizational management to those that take up the position of leading mmo guildsclanscorporationsarmies to success herding adhd cats on amphetamines to swim the english channel while solving differential equations in your head and reciting joyces ulysses from memory is trivial in comparison
i hate to say it and i dont support liangs tone but this is deadon rightwhat surprises me is that it got to this  why ccp would publically announce that shes being kicked for nda breach even if true is a big big question its gonna mess with this womans real life  true or not what a can of worms my advice would have simply been speak with her privately about it and then disqualify her from rerunning the fight doesnt seem worth the payoff
are you serious about what you just wrote if i were you id think about and hastely edit my post away
hey  im kinda slow so maybe you can help me out and elucidate on why you think this is such a stupid post the only reason i can imagine ccp would publically accuse her of breaching an nda which i am now convinced will likely have real world consequences on this womans real life is that the disclosure had commercial ramifications and the proof is rock solid im not saying thats not the case im just saying its an aggressive and risky route to take by ccp this really will likely mess with her real life  its not just internet spaceships at this pointps if you have access to my email feel free to use it
its a simple concept eva made a commitment to keep certain things to herself or only discuss amongst ccp employees or csm folks and made a personal choice to disregard that committment for whatever reason she violated the trust ccp placed in her just saying this is a computer game is irrelevent she made a personal real life committment and chose to break it tough beans i say we all move on
not announcing her dismissal would i think most probably result in eva jobse as ankhesencopypasta disappearing from eve and all itd take is one post of where in the world is ankhesencopypasta to trigger a tsunami of speculation even more vapid than the current demands for more information by the nosey parker brigade i dont mean to be rude but unless youre legal counsel to ccp your advice in this matter is irrelevant as ive tried to hint at before this point in time people need to stop and consider that the primary issue here may not be that there was an nda breach but rather how it happened this may be entirely why we havent heard anything more from official channelsthe reason we dont know is because the situation could be extremely seriousrealistically ccp is obligated to preserving itself and its precious bodily fluids first where eva works next is her concern anything else is absurd
well i hope it does end there hopefully she will acknowledge her guilt accept the ramifications and fallout and everyone will move on
cant really argue with thati retract my previous opinion

how is it risky for ccp its very simple she sign a contract stating that she would not disclose cretin information she disclosed that information to whom ever where ever when ever and what ever it was at the end of the day she broke a contract and she is very lucking ccp hasnt filed civil charges and if they do its will within their rightsccp didnt make eva look bad eva did and if she cant live with that then thats her problem ccp is in no way responsible for the choice she made in breaking the nda and has every right to explain to the player base why she was removed from the csm to say ccp caused personal damages is foolish and stupid they didnt force her to break the nda and regardless of how it might damage her job and profession she did it to herself she left the world of internet spaceships and entered the real world when she was voted in and signed that contract
it could be that ank made a serious breach of the nondisclosure agreement and ccp with all due legal diligence announced her departure from the csm in a well coordinated and strategized manner or it could be that someone in ccp made a mistake jumped the gun and ccp is now trying to quietly clean up the mess we dont know and without an evidentiary finding from some credible source the allegation that she violated a dnr remains just that an allegation im not trying to say that transparency and accountability on the part of ccp is unimportant or that representative bodies like the csm do not raise issues that transcend narrow legal interpretations of what a corporation can should or ought to do but we are all in the dark here until that changes one can only speculate i doubt that is a good use of our time delilah
fixed that for youthe point im trying to get across is that ccp is handling this in a manner which is consistent with a real and serious nda breach if any of the tinfoil hat reasons for them removing her were true such as her being as critical on her blog as all the other csm delegates spoongate being controversial a carebear not a member of an alliance power bloc etc then ccp would be liable for destroying her reputation and terminating her careerbut theyre handling this just like a real nda breach and so far so is ankh talk to a lawyer sit tight and shut the  up about it honestly its good advice for all of usliang
can we get some candidates that arent dikridding ccp for that 10bonues to shiptype for thier alliance these guys are all talk and no voting record and consistently bring us useless features and are often made using if statements in the games code
ive not worked under the scrum system but by having a self contained team of game designers programmers qa and so on i wonder if they are too close to give objective feedback amongst themselves until it is too far advanced to make widescale changes somebody with more experience of scrum should chime in thoughthis is pretty much accurate ive worked using this system twice once it worked because there were people outside watching closely once it failed because the team was so convinced our idea was brilliant we never really stopped to think
sense you are not making very much
the first question that must be asked and answered is this what is ccp willing to do on the scale of the eve online product to address player concerns  desires what resources are they willing to dedicate to those concerns and what amount of time in the development cycle to addressexamine those concerns without an answer to that single question any others are irreleventps and theres the friggin 5 minute delay pps from mynxees latest blog 
imo thats not inherent to scrum itself but more to the people in the teamsif the team members are capable of questioning and adjusting ideas plans and features then they dont need an external advisorotoh scrum is centered on the management of a projectit focuses on efficiency the burn down and getting done all the things that are mentioned in the release planimo its rather easy to forget about solid quality and basic commonsense for creating software because you can convice yourself everything is running fine as long as the process is still running fine  even if the result is not really under controlextreme programming as another agile method is clearly centered on the software code matters but might not be so popular with the management you mean 2 people are working on 1 problem at the same time we have to write code that tests our code before we are allowed to change it youre kidding right
just a quick status update about the meeting minutes2 july ccp sent initial draft of the minutes to csm4 july csm sent a substantially revised and expanded draft to ccp9 july ccp returned the draft with mostly minor edits11 july approved for publication final draft sent to ccp12 july publishedi believe that ccp intends to publish the minutes as early as possible next week with any luck that will be on mondaysome people question why this process takes so much time i will point out that it is a 28 page document that 9 csms plus ccp are contributing feedback to make sure it is right and we all have jobs and other rl obligations that prevent us from spending every waking moment on this particular task
excellent service
we understand that but updates like this are realy useful ppl dont mind waiting that much if they have an indication of when they are going to get what they wantbut ofcourse you as csm members know that already and will do your best to keep your public informed as much as possible
many thanks for the feedback few things irritate me as much as the impression of being ignored and thus updates like this are much appreciated now if only we could dispel that impression with regards to ankh
thanks for keeping the communication alive mynxee 
what benefits have we the players seen from the csm so farmaybe i havent been paying close enough attention but ive yet to see anything that ccp has done differently based on input from the csm that couldnt have been gathered much more cheaply via the suggestions in these forumssurely we dont need an entire council of players being sent to iceland in order to summarize forum feedback do we
lets take at look at the previous minutes which contain thisout of four point 2 was actually completed but was merely a fluff piece where the only concrete improvement notedis no longer the case as we are still waiting for the minutesany comment from the csm why you let ccp igonore you while continuing to play your part in the pr show 
so we get rid of the system instead of encouraging lazyignorant people to actually interact and do something positive to improve everyones experienceexcuse me while i got bash my head into a desk
its not that its because even though its all with the best intentions from both ccp  the voted csm theres abosultely nothing ever done to fix the issue brought up over and over and over do i need to go on
omg thats so true csm is a joke
were still waiting for the minutes because the csm asked to review and edit them before they got passed on to us
what do you propose we do fly to iceland and storm ccp headquarters demanding action communications with ccp is routinely slowit can take days to get an answer to a simple question email is the only mechanism we have for communicating and because of the common delay in replies nothing that resembles dialog is possiblethe csm edits to the minutes have been in ccps hands since sunday my last communication from them about the status of the minutes was tuesday at that time i expressed the opinion that contextual details of discussions are important to leave in to demonstrate the ways in which the csm is representing players views now were waiting for ccp to finish their edits if they actually do what was promised give csm the chance to review their edits before the minutes are published and we discover that we dont agree with their revisions then what csm has the choice of just letting them get published that way in the interest of timeplayer interest or risking further delay by insisting on changes that make sense to us as with most choices csm must make we are damned if we do and damned if we dont
time to disband csm  totallyccp dont even listen to it its been proved time and time againccp clearly do not listen or want to listen to the player baseand havent for years its a pr ploy thats badly implementedwhen are you going to wake up and small the coffee
i had hopes that csm5 would be different because of stakeholderbut so far not soyeah
you can resign its the only weapon in your arsenal unfortunately and it can only be used once ccp can and will ignore you if it suits their interests if ccp keeps sending you draft minutes you dont agree with will you keep sending them back until your csm period is over  there is obviously something massively wrong if the minutes are so different from what you remember being discussed and decided if its incompetence or malign intent that has caused this will have to be seen but you should at least make some sort of deadline by which either minutes are published or you take a standedit your acceptance of ccp taking days to communicate is worrying its the 21st century messages do not travel to iceland by ship anymore was this slow communication not one of the things that was supposed to improve since the csm was implemented 
resigning would be the easy way outbut imho would have zero impact on ccp or the csm process plus it would remove the the ability to report on matters from an inside perspectivewhich is vital to keeping players informed about realities of the csm process besidesi am still hopeful that csm5 can accomplish something useful even if that something turns out to be very different from our party line chartermy acceptance if you have some ideas for forcing a more timely response to emails with the exception of more emails a technique were already familiar with id love to hear them
talk to your ccp champions via skype or some other method  emails can and will be ignored if the recipient thinks they are not relevant or important
apparently being in the csm has zero impact on ccp or the csm process too ha too funny the only thing the csm tells the player base is one of three things1 useless filler information that is of no importance or stuff we already know2 some information about improvements that never happen3 teases of knowing some inside information just to throw out the nda in our face like some elitist pigthe entire gaming community is waiting for the day the csm accomplishes something useful that day from the looks of the way things are going will never come
mynxee you should only have to send your revisions 1 time if they post without the revisions you can create a thread about what they left out or mistated just because you let them publish the minutes without undue delay does not mean you agree they are complete or accurate dont let them drag this out because no one will care about what happened 6 months ago
things that the money used on the csm could be better used for bringing back eve tv redesigning and upgrading the forums putting together more random polls and surveys of the actual eve playerbase improving the eve store or adding more items to it adding more to live events improving the awful eve correspondents reports basically anything else that would actually benefit far more players you could take the budget for the csm and buy each dev at ccp a bunch of cheetos bags and youd be using the money in a better way for the people who pay for this gamethe csm is a total social butterfly idiotfest look at this thread people dont vote because they give a damn or think the csm actually does anything but because of alliance favors and requests so they can get inside information its why you see the same old people being elected each cycle from the big alliances so that they can get insider information about upcoming changes to the game and prepare for them early and so a few of them can get free trips to iceland they dont do any work they dont have new ideas its the same old people getting the same old advantages the csm is imbalancing impotent and idiotic get rid of it put the resources to something else that actually benefits the playerbase
if you were to work out the total cost for the csm on yearly basis you would probably find it to be laughably low compared the costs associated with assigning a scrum team to any of your suggested activities
communitycsmccpthe topic on the banned csm member at another place is sadening to read trolling hatemessages pettiness and all but heh capsuleers are what they are in rl thats the beauty of this game it mirrors rl to the bonemost saddening is csm itself many members dive into the trolling themselves some of them get censored by ccp moderators well ccp good luck with this csm finally we can conclude csm is a real offspring of the capsuleers democracy does work they focus on details more details and more replies are driven by emotional discontent and focuse on pettyself interest the larger picture that should be the mindset of any democratically elected representative is gone foreverquestion to ccp top brass didnt you as ccp ask for this yourself answer big yes sure you have the right not to disclose reasons but with this kind of community you brought it all in the forums yourself
the cost in time and effort on ccps part in maintaining this pointlessness that you so stridently defend is equal to or more than most of the things mentioned on that listit is no surprise that you defend the csm so much considering that you and your alliance use it to prepare for future changes to the game hell its the only reason you run for it you have about as much credibility defending the csm as the fox does in guarding the henhouse
citation needededit ill add an estimate of my own cost of the csm plane tickets hotels salary for the hours that pUFFFDtur and eyjUFFFD spend on it 50k  a year cost of running a scrum team for a year well over a millionhahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
when i read the op i spent five minutes trying to find the thumbs up icon to show i supported his post then i realised i was in the wrong subforum for that id love to reply to that but quite properly discussion of forum moderation isnt permittedi dont really know what i think of the csm i know it exists but it doesnt affect my gaming in any way as things stand were i to give it any real thought id likely conclude that its primarily a free trip to iceland for a small group of peoplethat said the onus is firmly on ccp if they want the csm to be a pr exercise then of course theyre going to continue to ignore anything thats said analogies are always iffy but the best one i can think of for the current situation is when the monarch was the real power in england and parliment was only called to nod their heads when the monarch wanted to raise taxeswhile ccp arent using the csm to the full potential can you really blame people for taking the free holiday we all love free stuff
fixing rockets could be done for 50k probably a lot less
well ok but you get the idea many of the larger features cost millions in development running the csm is a relatively minor expense
im not saying that the pr from csm is not worth it for ccp it might be it might not  i mind my business they can mind theirs but as far as cost any of the ideas above could be outsourced and cost less than this csm stuff dont forget that ccp employees do take time to deal with csm so its not just the cost of plane tickets and hotels they need to practice the sincere looks they give you when they do their best billy clinton imitation and say i feel your pain it seems you guys are still going for that line this is kind of sad after 4 years of that same routine i would think you would have the devs resorting to saying things like it depends on what the meaning of the word is is csm has a long way to go but good luck to you
sez who seriously what exactly has been accomplished and what new inroads into ccp companyplayerbase relations have been created the job of csm is to bring playerbase concerns to ccp once thats done then what its up to ccp to decide whats best for their business plan and not a bunch of players incapable of either a cooperating in an adult manner or b sticking to participation agreements they agreed to ie the nda issue csm cant and wont change ccp development direction and as ive read from the minutes the player representatives ie ankh have their own agendas so now what
a 28 page document sometimes requires some back and forth collaboration its necessary that the official record of the meeting be accurate because threads are lost in the mists of time documents like meeting minutes not so much in any event i received ccp edits a couple of hours ago surprisingly few changes were made so once i correlate csm feedback this weekend i can send a csm approved for publication version nlt sunday i believe ccps goal is to get the minutes out as early as possible next weekhopefully mondaysomeone mentioned collaborating via skype earlier in this thread i had already suggested this to ccp but no traction on that front yet
agendaa introduction roll call break to allow remaining csm to stop laughing at the roll call remindersb issues sokratesz discuss how awesome i am and how pve based players should be hunted down and killed ingame more easily trebor discussion on how funny it is to see yet another class of ship appear on peoples killmails mynxee implement minigames like farmville in facebooki mean evegate mynxee show drone damage in logs wiki dealing with the resultant megs of txt files that no one will look at mynxee how to fix lag in game from fleet battlesnah jk maybe something lame like make cyno effect aweinspiring againc other businessthere we go fixed it for you
that might actually be the first funny thing you posted props to you
actually that ones a great example of how closely integrated eve gate is with eve itself we have facebook and we have a farmville app but the farmville app isnt actually in the facebook in order to get the full farmville experience you need both eve gate and planetary interaction its synergies like this that have made eve online the game it is today
why bother sokratesz theyve already said there not going to do anything about anything i feel sorry for you guys because itll turn out a direct reflection on the csm and turn more people off voting or participating
that was the intention so its nice that its recognised as suchthe other postings though werent made in jest but in all seriousness glad to see that they also are being recognised as such
what you really should do is go back to elementary school and learn basic english
please refrain from trolling or we may end up having to post with real names wich of course shant bother me none as i dont try an induce arguments or flame however it may effect you some what
herschal yamamoto best yamamoto
i agree that its not needed to listen to those who didnt vote when assembling a csm in this case 3k votes represent such a large block that automatically choosing 11 would be unfair someone with similar views as ankh should be selected but maybe with a different modus operandi so far ccp has not appointed a new member so theres hope that they wont go for 11 automatically
i was also thinking as the mechanice are in place for mass votingif any major issue comes up would csm recomend a referendum ofc organised by csm
meh do whatever you want at this point i have lost 100 faith in the csm time and time again i get my hopes up only to have the dashed by some edness from a csm member or ccp that just reinforces everyones feelings that the csm is a jokefunny how the last csm waved around some victory flag in getting the csm as a supposed stakeholder only to see that it actually means jack nothing against any specific csm members i applaud the time and effort you guys and gals do put into it but alas it is all in veinnot going to waste any more of my time in jita speaker corner or assembly hall
thank god for that
i knew you would come running in here to try and troll your too predictable anymore
actually posting that youre going away and then waiting for someone to comment on it so that you can post gotcha i didnt really go away is trolling mere negative remarks about you are not in fact trolling also you seem to have not gone away
ok that made my day night oh hell im not even sure what time it is anymore
im still curious what it actually is about my behaviour that you dislike
i too dislike everything there is about sokratesz
in other news the baby frog in my aquarium just ate a fly he looked super happy about it too 
you dont like ankh and youre a pvper  youre worse than the devil
yeah damn pvper damn all of them to hellmynx explained it for you in her ragepoast what more explanation do you need
except of course if the csm had stood behind sok who was only speaking the truth anyways and simply said that theyd gotten a lot done but that throwing things in a fit of pique was beyond the pale there would have been less csm infighting and tehyd have stood together against the bad behavior of a member who was removed from the csm anyways ah well

i agree i rather have half the expansions provided they were done right perhaps they should also fix some of the backlog issues before moving to the next big thing

ive already added my support for this as well as the devs should play the game idea if csm took only these two items to the table with ccp there could be a big turnaround in the quality of eve because these two items would affect every other proposal made in this forum imagine what the ripple effect would be like in the mmo community and the entire gaming industry for that matter to learn that ccp in an effort to follow their motto of excellence and by listening to their playerbase has decided to slow the developement of both incarna and dust514 temporarily in order to put forth an expansion of nothing but fixes and polish to already existing content mechanics and ui including or followed by the completion of some of the promised andor halffinished features that have piled up over the years like unpublished skill sets and the much maligned learning skills as an example once this was done the releases of both incarna and dust514 would be followed by planned stages of the same fixes and polishccp would immediately jump to the top of the class players would try the game just to see what a truly polished mmo looked like since such a beast is nonexistant in todays mmo world and where the devs actually listen to the players as well as playing the game themselves so as to continually improve both its performance and quality not only would subscriptions rise but with the reputation of putting out a topnotch quality game that is constantly fixed and polished ccps future releases such as dust514 would undoubtably draw a larger response from both the media and the players looking for a new game and if the need arose i doubt that a company with a reputation for both inovation and excellence would find it very hard to acquire investment fundsthese two ideas and especially this one simply makes both marketing and business sense it may cost a bit on the front end by delaying the two aforementioned expansions if dust can be considered an expansion and investing the manpower to accomplish the fixespolish expansions but the rewards down the road would undoubtably offset that investment many times over
at this point i think everything has been said so here is my support
definitely
sweet baby jesus yes 1remember ccp vox populi vox deinext expansion is called pollux and does what castor did back in the day ok
i can only agree to it
id be more than happy with 1 expansion a year  hell id be ecstatic if the next expansion was nothing but fixes and development of past expansions
supported please bring old effect back or get a new one just as impressivewhile i agree that its not a priority like lag we are not asking the impossiblefact is that this topic is supported by a lot of capsuleers so why not make it happen

this is a fail idea eve needs the learning skillsthey add depth
reading a lot of the comments and assertions by those opposed to removing learning skills makes me feel like im witnessing the thoughts of people from another dimension where up is down black is white and wrong is right seriously can just one of you come up with logical argument supporting learning skill in eve that makes sense this side of reality and is not a poorly masked attempt to keep a perceived personal advantagehow about the comment above mine learning skills add depth really depth in what way because a lot of the rest of us arent seeing it
does the question of when to put money into savings versus when to spend money on stuff add depth to lifedoes the question of when to keep going to school versus when to enter the job market add depth to lifeif the answer to either or both of these questions is yes  learning skills add depth to eve
not supported as many have said new players are not forced to train them instead of fun skillsive been playing since that fateful may 2003 i didnt train all the learning skills all at once im now proabably behind a lot if not all 2k3 vets in sp total but do i care no really i trained them as i went along when i felt i could and they benefit me now but overall i had more fun in those first 36 months than most as i avoided the brainwashing of learning skills must be trained
2003  2010
not really also eve already has a dynamic economy and economic choices that a player has to make that actually involves well money isk so learning skills are not required to create this it already exists without themslightly but this isnt even relevant to learning skills in eve the direct comparison is training skills that actually do something so do i train a 2 day skill that gets me x or do i put that 30 day investment to get y dont know about you but of all my years at university and college i can only recall spending maybe 2 hours taking an optional workshop that was about learning to learnno even if both were true it doesnt lead to your conclusion lets be frank here learning skills are no more than an arbitrary time sink no amount of spin can change that
i havent heard one serious reason why learnings should not be removed looks like they will very soon 
and i hope that happens asap they are utteraly useless i hurts me when a new player spends weeks of his time in a frig wituot anything to do doing learning skills while i try to prevent such stupidity where i can some silly people somewhere suffer

whole heartedly agree
yesyes the api is a great way to spend some development resources it doesnt have combat balance issues or ccp likes 00locarebear better  all would benefit it doesnt require a client upgrade so it can happen in between the 6 months cycles it is also very visibleyes to evegate using apisyes yes yes to open standardsyes to realizing that as you move into the web in general and open standards and especially social networking a good job is going to require ccp to move far far away from their microsoft comfort zoneyes to now is the time to address evegate and the architecture before more gets built nor do you want to get the dust integration started this way

yep sounds goodthere just isnt a good reason why not to do this
supportedi always wondered why you could warp to a bookmark but not align to it i mean right now we can initiate warp to a bookmark and then stop our ship turn on engine again before it warps thus being aligned so why not just let us align
this feature has been on sisi for a few weeks
signed
concept supported would be highly useful and most welcome enhancement the implementation suggestions are interesting but it would obviously be up to devs to respond with what is and isnt doable and how potential tech issues related to varying computer capabilities might be addressed
i wonder if this is because the warp off after you log off costs cap like a normal warp as well as the warp back
i think you can rule that out because warping a supercap costs only a very tiny fraction of its total cap
supported make my hybrid weapons worth the training time 
reduce cap use of blasters and change dmg bonus on thorax brutix incursus and hyperion to a rof bonus t2 hulls such as enyo deimos and astarte would swap 1 of their 5 dmg bonusesenyo only has 1 for the 5 rof not both little more dps and ideally a similar cap use to what we have nowanother solution could be to increase cap use cut rof in half and increase dmg mod to keep the same dps this will give blasters a close range alpha niche something that may end up being usefulloverall i think that the fitting reqs for blasters needs to be looked at as well in comparison to acs they have much higher fitting reqs fixed dmg uber close range and they use cap ontop of that fact minnie ships often have more grid allowing for much easier fits with better performance could always just increase grid and cpu on some of the gallente lineup by a small amount to make the balancing process easier wo having to rebalance all ships that potentially will fit the reduced fitting req blasters

another way of fixing rails is giving rail boats a new bonus how about they can lock outside that 249 km lock limit and make them true snipers modern rail guns can shoot around 200km and there close to the small rail guns so allow larges to shoot at 350km  with a average dps low alphamediums should be 150km with average dps for that weapon sizesmall rails can already get to 90kms on a cormie so i think there okblasters are harder but it all comes from there low range a micro warp or afterburner bonus to blaster boats would help fix those problems by allowing them to get in rangeanyway thats my 02 isk
no such thing as a modern rail gun that has placed a 200km shot navy is still testing thier 16mj testbed with computer models including a 64mj gun netting the 200 mile range they are looking for a production level rail gun is not even close to being completed in the near future due to the restrictions the immense power needs create naval rail guns will need to be powered by nuclear reactors something not ideal on a smaller more vulnerable surface craft such as a destroyercruiser hull or true cruiser
yes but they are railguns close to the size of smalls so i think a large could hit 350km thats 208 miles and the ships can go faster than the speed of light i think there fusion power cores could handle a rail gun
lets not even start comparing prototype rl rail guns to what we have in eve for example rl cruise missiles have ranges beyond 1500 miles why dont the ones in eve go 5000 miles reason balance 249km cap is there for a reason and is not going byby anytime soon

sure seems reasonable and sounds greatbut let me give you the counterarguments1 are you saying this is important enough that you would have the devs play at work so instead of spending 40 or 60 or whatever hoursweek developing eve and fixing lag they would spend fewer hours working on developing eve or is the proposal just to extract unpaid effort from the devs and if you can extract the extra hours from them wouldnt those hours be better spent on for example fixing lag regardless considering the crunch ccp is now in quality  dust  incarna  lag  i suspect proposals that would divert resources have an uphill climb while i certainly would appreciate the irony do you really want a dev taking 40 hours of their life that could be spent developing eve in clicking on pi things and grinding missions to replace their ship taking 20 minutes to fly someone by mindlessly clicking wt0 is a mindless time sink once you get your pi network designed and laid out then logging into each character and doing several dozen double clicks per planet per character is a mindless time sink by design i think the employees time clearly would be better spent developing software2 also playing eve may not be enough would 20 hours of station trading and mining a week give a dev much insight into 1500 vs 1500 fleet battles or vice versa for that matter 3 there are already a number of t20ccp gave nc super cap comments is everyone going to believe everything is a completely level playing field i would but there are a number of tinfoil hats about if as am employee i a required to play eve and the ship i spent 2x35 on get destroyed by some lolsuicideganker then is that a reimbursable business expense4 remember that skill system should ccp the developers who are working on moms and titans the skills and isk to fly one asap solving 2 but exacerbating 3 above or should they be required to play eve yet it might be many many months before they can fly what is related to their development effort nb the following is mostly humor with a touch of troll but a sprinkling of truth a lot of the interaction in eve is about hurting other people when a dev is under the timecrunch i hope they are under now then how uplifting would it be to come home after 12 hours at the office and get connedgankedsuicided maybe the pi clicking was designed by a developer who got his tengu ganked at a gatecamp and thought ill show those ahats lets see how they like a few thousand clicks a day to fuel their pos i just think an eve developer would treat eve customers better if she never met them just saying
can i get you to come over and be my vacuum cleaner i need your sucking up power to get the hard to get at dirt that is deep in the shag pile or are you still lording it over the deaf btch gets kicked off csm posting kudos  good to see the calibre of the representative members of the csm going up in quality
1  when i was in iceland for the csm there were devs playing counterstrikeor whatever fps game as well as shooting each other with nerf guns and stuff they have recreational time at work how much time is required or encouraged is just a smaller detail and not a dealbreaker and something for their management to work out 2  not my call eve is a sandbox for devs too im not really one to micromanage3 not strictly relevant in my opinion 4 devs already have charactersat least usually they get to keep their player characters from before ccp when we were given the updated new player experience presentation for example in csm3 the people that worked on that all seemed to have a thorough knowledge of the tutorial both from experiencing itpresumably with new characters and through diagnostic tools used to monitor new players behaviors while using the tutorial so now at least eves new player experience might not rank as most difficult ever but maybe third or fourth most difficult everon the other hand the new sov system was created by somebody who clearly did not ever spend eight hours shooting a station as a punishment for doing something like that to us they should be forced to participate in capturing a region my happiness rests on the misfortune of others
i know  thats why you are so deliciously perfect for the csm and why i and others are so happy to see you join it nothing makes the dysfunctional complete like a misogynist
i love you too
personnally ive never played any mmo that was worth playing in which many of the devs did not play the game they were working on take lotro as an example one forum thread asked the devs who played to acknowledge the fact without giving their character names although a few went so far as revealing the servers they played on and the response was phenomenal along with the responses many noted that through their gameplay they had improved the game by experiencing the problem areas and bugs firsthand it was also noted that even though they were encouraged to spend some time during the work day ingame many also played from home after hours often with spouses friends and even fellow devs this just seems to be a natural part of developing a game how in h can you keep an interest in and a deep understanding of the game you work on if you never play it and experience the game as a whole instead of just the small part you are assigned to in code so yes i do consider this just as important as time spent actually coding and fixing the bugs and lag issues
would be good
way to go mazz
ok
well i sortof agree while developers should not be forced to play the game they definitely need to atleast try out the area of the game they are working on and see what it is like firsthand experience can be more valuable then spreadsheets sometimesand its not called waisting time at work its called testing
devs do play the game as npc toons and even as some player corps they might even come pirate u but they fly with standard stuff on those toosn to get an idea of things
supported game devs that dont play their own games make terrible games
i can get behind this 100devs can also join random alliance chats either openly to initiate diologue or invisibly to just listen in tho this will give them a bunch of random points hardly important to their job and for those who do play spy

sok if i were you i would turn in that fancy csm title whether you realize it or not you represent thousands of people who play a complicated game your job is not to troll or offer input without careful consideration you are supposed to be a voice of reason and measured debatenyouve pretty well disgraced the title man
i already elaborated on that good sir
do you play this game
if people are talking about spider tanking gangs not spider tanking logistics they are in general talking about spider tanking gangs and not gangs with spider tanking logistics just a fyi since you seem to be missing the pointslots are not the main problem for shield spider tanking gangs tackling and stuff can be done by dedicated tacklers broadonyx especially and not that many ships fit offensive ewar on spider bs anyway what hurts a bit is the lack of sensor boosters and eccm which can be partially compensated for by their low slot items not as effective as the mid slot ones but luckily your entire gang got bloated sig radius so that compensates for sebo and low slot eccm gives more locked target which is handy sure you rather got more mids but that would be a reason why there would be more rr armor bs than rr shield bs not why there are pretty much only rr armor bsif you want a shield tanking bs gang you can in principle take about any ship with 5 mids which exlcuding amarr all races can do easily mwdlse2x invulncap booster but while rr armor is very easy to fit compared to other high slot modules shield transporters take up half your cpunow if you actually surprise us and read this for a moment instead of trolling that scimitars can fit transporters we know they can rr shield and rr armor do not need to be the same but that also doesnt mean shield transporters need ridiculous fitting requirements compared to remote armor reppers
how could i miss this gem earlier i indeed represent awhole lot of people as you easily confirm by looking at the proposals i have supported and by asking one of the many people that i have discussed items related to the csm with in the past 8 months5 mids is insufficient rrbs need a point andor sensorbooster andor eccm and or webscram that puts us at 78 mids i will just repeat here that the problem is not the fitting requirements of the modules but the ships
you are just not reading they dont need webbers and scrams because  and they dont need eccm and sensor boosters because  yes problem is the fitting
no just no this has been gone over 100 times in 100 differnt post just say noshields work differntly then armor end of story
why fit a module that sucks up 50 of your cpu in one go
more constructive criticism please or did you mean shield rr does not work in the difference or armorproving my point
sokratez please stop trolling this isnt about logistics cruisers which are well balanced this is about the relative ease of fitting of rr on nonspecialised ships
then why not increase pg cost of rr armor with 200 or something then it is relative equal to the cpu cost of shield transporters and they are still different or lets increase cap use of rr armor by factor 5 then they are different than shield transporters and apparently that is what you wantthere is a difference between different and clearly inferior they are different shield transporters do shield armor do armor shield transporters rep at beginning of cycle also another reason why sebos are less important than on rr armor ships rr armor is significantly more cap efficient but cant be overloaded as long all balanced so far but being different does not mean one needs to be impossible to fit
i am very much not trolling but maybe before one tries to fix something that in one limited perception appears broken one should find out from the people who designed the system whether it is performing as expected at all
well i am sorry for having to use only my own limited perception but that is the only perception i have available and about finding out should we wait for ccp dev that was coming up with stats for these modules to respond in this thread that might take quite a while in that case we should not move the trash it button either maybe they put it there intentionally and every day somebody trashes their carrier as intended by ccp no problem there working as intended regardless of ccps thought or more likely its absence that went into putting trash it button next to activate ship we want it moved same thing here what ccp though back in 2003 does not matter what matters is there is a problem to be solved if you dont like the solution propose a better one or give constructive criticism if you dont like my limited perception please be my eye opener i would expect better then i have no idea wtf you two are talking about from you
translationpeople who designed the system  ccp you expect ccp to tell us whether rr bs gangs are performing as expected and whatever this expectation is this isnt the forum for ccp telling us stuff theres no forum for that this forum is for the proposal of changes to the game ive supported this proposal with a wealth of evidence youve blathered about irrelevancies
you can of course just petition it and ask them but that would be way too easy
shield tankers already have the drake to work with now they complain about armour tanks being oped you pretty much answered your own proposal in the first paragraph shield tankers have access to insane resistances why should they get equal remote repairs
first of all i am not a shield tankersecond the large shield extenders are crapthird shieldtank takes away valuable midslotsright so a typhoon pilot is not allowed to fit a shield transfer because drake is too good thats a solid argument
shield tanks getpassive tanking abilitiesactive omni resistance boostersan active tanking implant setdecent remote repping skillsbut you dont use them apparently but are still whining for a boost you think maybe you have too much time on your hands
armor tank getsbetter buffer tankspassive omni resistance boostersa buffer tanking implant setdecent remote repping skillsremote repping righow is all this relevant that shield transporters take ridiculous amount of cpu
because nothing deemed balanced at one time has ever been changedstop falling back on the ccp made it this way cop out and start actually taking part in the discussion beyond bad trolling
way to post something totally irrelevant i am not copping out in any way i am simply saying that before you can start proposing solutions you should ask ccp how they think the system is functioning1 shield transfers on logistics are totally fine2 i agree that shield bs gangs arent exactly overwhelming  but is a simple reduction of module stats the solution or is there a larger underlying problem hint yes there are several
wtf is the csm for if not for raising issues and ideasif ccp would think it is not working as they want it then it wouldnt need to be raised since they would be aware of it the entire idea of the csm is to raise problems and ideas to ccp did you first ask ccp how shield gang bonuses are supposed to work before you made that topic did you ask them how capacitor recharge when logging off is supposed to work it is as simple as fixing one number look even easier than fixing rockets yes there will be other problems that wont result in very high popularity of shield bs rr gangs but then at least they can be done as effective as armor rr of course it wont be as popular there are just more armor tanking bs than shield tankers amarr players whine when excluded etc but then it would be a viable option at leastbut there are no underlying problems as you claim that would really make it a problem no tackle we got dedicated tackle for a reason especially hics no offensive ewar i pretty much never see them on rr bs no seboseccm well you got higher sig radius already so sebos not that much needed but that is a weakness and with not everyone and their mother having falcon alt anymore low slot eccm modules will do fine especially since the extra locked targets are nice for rr bs of course i rather have the extra available mids a rr armor gang has but at the same time a rr shield gang can fit their lows with damage mods and tracking enhancers so just more effective damagehowever right now you dont have that advantage of more low slots since you got to fill them with coprocs to get enough cpu
ok the issue is that passive shield tanks do not benefit from the implants or booster bonuses but a passive ship with a shield transfer would be nearly unstoppablemaking shield transfer as efficient as armor repair would make shield tank gangs tought to damage way more than a coorsponding boost to remote armor repping would causelastly would it really be a different races defensive system if they were all equal the balance is not in detailed system by system equalivalense it is in the overall balance ship class to ship class a drake and a myrmidion are vastly different but in a hundred head to head bsattles there would likely be parity in outcomes
omg flip flopping already dude please stop assuming that this community is filled with idiots because unfortunately for you its not i did not have much respect for your points prior to this post but now youve shown youre not even willing to stick with your original argument yuckyou are using a cop out your solution to petition ccp on their opinion is not only a run around but also annoying to gms answering those pointless petitions you suggest what are they gana do call iceland from germany to ask a game developers opinion on a single petition wow bro people have been asking for ccps point of view on issues for a long time guess what almost never happens an actual response honestly i hope im wrong and i hope that ccp will become more transparent with their opinions but regardless if ccp deems something as working as intended it does not mean that it is balanced hence the debates taking place on this board for over 7 years that have directly impacted the future of the game
actually i have done this several times in the past and have eventually gotten a satisfying reply in every case dont diss it because it sounds too easy
well you arent getting a satisfying reply from me on that note why
ive been watching the threads and such for a long time on what to do with low sec and its always a dead lock between people wanting it to be safer and pirates wanting it to be more deadly in the end its a stale mate if the pirates get what they want no high sec people will come if the high sec people get what they want pirates will be irate then there is the case well we need to make low sec more rewarding if that happens all the market people will cry like the did about level 4 loot which is just lol if you ask me all the problems in eve and we have to cry about mission lootmy crazy out of the box idealets make low sec a place that player corps and alliances are able to take a certain level of control sanctioned by concordwhat do i mean sanctioned by concord well allow for player corps and alliance to pay a fee to setup shop in low sec where which you can chose 2 paths1 for pirates  allow pirate corpsalliances to pay off concord in those systems they occupy to remove all gate and station guns in their low sec systems for a monthly rent now i know what your thinking no one will go in then well thats why you are going to have to fight for prime locations such as choke points besides your a pirate you wanted to fight so go fight for some space to hunt in on the plus side players flying into your space would not have any idea that you paid off concord to remove gate guns and such thus giving you a better chance at prey in these system exploration and missions should also get a boost in drops and such to make taking a risk in such a system worth it and allow the pirates an alternate source of incomesec status repair if need be2 for anti pirates  allow player corpsalliances to pay concord for protection this would work differently though corpsalliances would be allowed to set a toll on the gate based on the mass and type of their ship which the player had a choice to pay this toll would be paid to the occupying corpalliance if the player payed the toll they would be able to enter with blue standing to all in local for just that system and would be protected by concord vs the owners and other players if they chose not to pay all normal low sec rules apply and would be neutral missions rewards would be much like high sec exploration would only be slightly better and low sec ores would still be present to mine these systems would bring in good money as it would attract minersalso as a way to control the traffic in your systems you have the right to control how the toll will work you can chose either only to allow people that have standing with your corpalliance to be able to pay the toll for protection and refusing neutrals the right to protection or you can chose to only refuse people who have neg status with the corpallianceall in all i think this would really add some great conflict to low sec and kinda making it like the first step to null sec by being able to occupy a system but without the null sec rewards i also think it would bring people together even more although i do realize this is a massive massive change and i bet many will hate it but still it was just a idea i had and i thought i would throw it out thereany and all feedback welcome
its an interesting question if they could do this for low sec why not 00 as wellin practice however i just dont think its going to be workable who wants to be looking at a modal window when youre travelling from one low sec system to anotheri wonder what cat thinks of this idea
not supported at allpirates already fight just fine with sentry guns as they have chosen to live with them so no big change there however carebears are gonna be useless to suicide gank or kill in anything bigger than a destroyer this will only mean less targets yes low sec might be more populated but the number of kills you can actually get would go down by far
i cannot support the idea in its current shape but this is definately interesting and ith osme work can be a very good proposal just needs to be balanced and details worked out try posting in idea first and get it polished i definitely like the idea that the corporation dominating the sayd system would get payed i am not sure about buyingoff concord although we should definately have some benefits for a dominating corporation i am not sure if concord should get involved but for example introducing a delay before sentry guns start reacting or something of that nature
what made me think of it is partly due to living in the united states every state has tolls just to use highways or bridges and so on this generates income for the state so its a real world application i then broke it down looking at the states as separate entities like corps is eve that how got this idea like i said nothing amazing but something to throw out thereyeah ill change it to idea rather than proposal
this was an original idea but i think there is nothing wrong with the learning skills as isonly the way people choose to front load them into their play style use them sparingly and over time balance the long term plan with the fun todaythis is a video game if its not fun youre doing it wrong
chestbumpsi think its more likely that some people in iceland got free isk the icelandic version
wrong let me refresh your memoryso yeah perhaps you should read the news or spend 30 seconds on evesearchcom like i did in order to find the information the op wanted you can also spend an additional 30 seconds in order to open the calculator and find out how much  2400 plexs equate tothis whole thing is months old you have got to be kidding me you are worried about this now have you heard the recent news we landed a man on the moon
your opinion is dead wrong then theres literally no other way to handle it if it is in fact a breach of nda i hate repeating myself but ccp has made an announcement that eva jobse has breached her nda and removed her from the csm this means that eva jobse has a very real possibility of being terminated from her current position apparently at another game development company where she is undoubtedly also bound by an nda this will almost certainly terminate her career in her current industry as well as any other industry which routinely requires a ndajust in case the obvious implication doesnt hit you with a 10 ton hammer across the side of the head ccp either has some pretty solid proof of a real and serious nda breach or theyre about to be in a civil suit worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and much more in damages seeing as how their lawyers who were almost certain to be involved would  themselves over the second option its almost got to be the firstso what got her in trouble logically we can assume that she knows at least as much as the other csm delegates  and potentially more via a side conversation etc we can exclude information and attitudes that were posted in blogs other than hers and thus can exclude her blog we can exclude spoongate because there are much more direct and legally safe ways of handling that really we can exclude pretty much all the tinfoil hat bull people are coming up with because of the seriousness of the manner in which this was done ccp and eva jobse are both handling this like it is a real and serious legal issue and it is and they both are doing what id think any competent legal counsel would advise  sit tight and stfua bit better actually its a sign that theyre taking this position seriously and giving them enough power and information to warrant an nda and significant legal risksliang
this whole thing is only a touchy issue because its ankh if it was anyone else it would be oh wow what a tard and blow over this despite the fact that based on her general behavior she was also the csm member most likely to ignore an ndadrama and ankh hmm what a surprise
 thiswithout some information from ccp this appears to be what happened
im pretty sure that the minutes wont agree with you and without information from ccp id argue that it appears theres a serious legal problem  such as perhaps a breach of nda stop with the tinfoil hattery at this point it looks stupidliang
a simple observationuntil ccp clarifies to players satisfaction it appears politicaljust the reality of the situation
ive outlined an enormous number of reasons that make the political tinfoil hattery answer about as reasonable as walking stark naked to work tomorrow morning through downtown chicago when you have 0 no means of communication and are currently in antarctica a thousand miles from the nearest humanplease stop with the tinfoil hattery ccp has just committed themselves to an enormous legal liability and both they and eva are handling this exactly as though its a real honest to god nda breach liang
nvm  link is screwed
yes you are correct i agreehowever none of that changes the fact that eve players are expecting more information
that is true and that is what we are pushing for at this very moment although as liang has elaborated on at length ccp is not obligated to inform us in any way and if it was a different council member the sentiment echoed on these forums by a fanatic few would be wholly absent or even worse inversed
i hate to be disappointing you here but ankh took up the least speaking time by far in fact she didnt say anything at all during about half the meetings
i know was she meta gaming in the real worldlike a company spy trying to steal some valuble trade secert from ccp lmao i just had to put it out there becouse i thought it was funny 
as we will never hear the outcome of it what has happened du too sentisive of the informationas a voter who had 3 times voted on her you feel a certain point of disappointedand now my feeling is in what sense can we trust that members we choose for csm have the right intension as read further i read that the meeting only takes place in hq in other words they trust no one anymorealthough a see ten times we had nothing too do with it what must we believe as voters over it does csm still act as pact for evevoters and for what they stand foralso i see non disclore agreement i think most of members even do not even know what it is only people who work in the security branches so where does stand for what involves itak
i quite liked her blogthis is a quote from ankh from the massively website  eva had the following to say all i can say at the moment is that out of respect for the csm the players of eve as well as the good people at ccp i cannot give any details besides my personal conviction that ccps statement is not in relation to any of my recent publications and that i do not share ccps conclusion that there has in fact been an nda breach i am currently engaged in following up this situation with ccpsource is here
if there wasnt then why is she still deadsilent havent seen her in forums or anywhere since 3 days and countingshe got way too much to loose and her behaviour hints at something really really serious ccp wouldnt risk getting sued into oblivion with false accusations given her life is basically depending on if that was true or notthe best guess in her favour is that she told someone something that was under the nda but she didnt think it was beyond that it can only become worse
completely agree with thisyou have to remember that this has a massive impact on evas real life if she has in fact deliberately broke the terms and conditions of a nda then this could have a massive impact on her professional lifeccp knows this as well i dont believe they would for one minute accuse somebody who real life work revolves around game design of something as serious of breaching a nda because she said a few things that they didnt like this would leave ccp open to being sued for liable i suspect like madner that eva has unwittingly and accidentally revealed some information that was covered by a nda hence forcing ccp to remove her from the csmalso i suspect that due to evas silence that she has become aware of this breachlets be honest here if you were in evas position where your professional livelihood was under threat because somebody made a serious accusation about you and you knew 100 you were innocent you would be screaming for all to hear protesting your innocentas for ccp releasing more information well you can forget it it was a breach of nda you expect ccp to state how eva broke the nda in the process of doing this ccp themselves breaching the ndai only hope for eva that it was just a simple mistake and will not be taken any further
well actually yes thats completely your problem and it always is when you are a public speaker  delegate thats part of what is called politics
maybe thats also the reason that internet politics  rl politics
supposedly its nothing to do with the csm you dont need the csm to tell you that little is being done about much except incarna and dust514 pm is a huge disappointment like fw was previouslyank is disputing that she has in fact breached the ndaeva is a game developer by profession maybe the issues lies thereall in all no one knows squat so sokratesz should put a sock in itdeck
i have come to believe this as well simply put given her personality if ccp had removed her without justification shed be shouting from the rooftops about now or blustering about filing a lawsuithowever the topic under discussion isnt directly whether or not she did something wrong or even exactly what she did the topic under discussion is whether ccp should provide more details particularly to the csm such as for example officially saying no it wasnt her blog right now the impression that ccp is conveying isnda breach  seriouscsm  jokeas in they are ignoring the csm children to deal with a serious matter just remember that the next time you see some of the rhertoric of i will hold ccp accountable for insert issue here
a what oo
i wish the line was so easy to cut sadly for you it isnt
as far as ive seen internet politics is a good deal more complicated stupid and filled with assumptions than rl politicspoint aside if she broke her nda then theres no frakkin reason for ccp to tell us all exactly what she saw that broke her nda as thats the whole point of a goddamn nondisclosure agreement to make sure the general population aka eves players dont know whats happening in iceland
yes yes it is
i am against this proposal because there is no forethought that goes into protecting yourself against ecm all youve gotta do is stick the proverbial condom in your wallet and forget about it until the the right time comesif you see a blackbird on the field pop the pill if you dont you pay no cost to protect yourself you dont suffer the potential drawbacks of the pill you dont consume the expensive itemevery other ecm requires some forethought to protect yourself from it and suffers correspondingly if you use it needlessly whether this is as simple as losing a midslot for eccm or a damage mod to fit a sensor boosteri lose this semiexpensive pill if i get blown up isnt forethought or compromise petition not supported
i support this trivetra ive always been a fan they need fof ammocrystals for turrets or some other way to combat ecm i thought maybe some kind of manual targeting system i had thought of a way that was camera based but since eve doesnt have have bullet trajectory physics its impossible
that is insane and this guy ought to have his loki replaced if records support it it takes some people a lot of time to get those t3 ships i dont mind if i lose a tengu for legit reasons but that is just stupid
youre playing eve wrong its a primarily pvp game whether that be piracy fighting over nullsec turf or lowsec mission hubs or marketingquit doing anything that has to do with gridning and iskhour ie missioningunlike wow eve isnt linear so you never have to start over when you lose your ship
well you may not have to do it but wait until you start seeing the cost of t2 materials going through the roof as pos fuel hoards dry upgive it a few months and see if the price of t2 hasnt gone up at least 30
theres almost no risk thus there should be very little rewardgames like wow reward hard work games like eve should reward cleverness and risktaking

thats their actual response or just an educated guess
thisedit i mean seriously really
while i do not agree with all the issues the op brought up i do think that improving or actually finishing in some cases older features is more important than introducing new ones some of them wouldnt require that much time in my opinion ie rocketsregards lax

that sounds like a cool ideal in a way but i cant support this as ismybe if you came out with a mod jamming system that shuts down a random mod much like jamming drops your locks and you cant lock only this thing turns off a mod randomly and you cant turn it back on brifly
bad idea bad poster bad thread
errrr no
hacs and recon ships receive a small but convenient benefit in that they have a 375 aus warp speed many ships that fly with them notably logistics cruisers and sometimes t3s lack this benefitas a result the hac gang is not able to benefit from this increased warp speed as their gang warp is restricted by the slower ships in their squadi suggest increasing the warp speed on logistics and t3 cruisers to match the 375 aus warp speed of hacs and recon shipsits a small quality of life change but i dont see any serious balance concerns and itd make the t2t3 cruiser gangs a lot easier to coordinate when jumping to locations
logis yes no reason they shouldnt have thist3s maybe but perhaps a subsystem that increases warp speedgeneral idea supported
supporting own topicedit and a whole subsystem just for warp speed are you joking who would ever use that crap seriously its a t3 it should be at least on par even if only in something as trivial as warp speed
doesnt the tengu already have such a subsystemah jep tengu propulsion gravitational capacitor 15 warp speed 15 reduction in warp cap uselevel  1 low the other races t3 ships are provided with different types of speed boni through their propulsion subsystems i dont see why this should be changedlogistics well maybe lower warpspeed might be an intended drawback for having remotereps in your fleetregards lax
xd that made me laugh so hard because there is a subsystem that exactly does that and exactly no one uses itand i do very much agree that they should also get their base warp speed to 375
just a quick note that this proposal was just passed by the csm on a 90 vote with only minor changes to the preamble
sure sounds reasonable
i dont know what game youve been playing but if you use a little brainpower you can easily run missions in shortranged weapon setups albeit it takes a bit longer and you have to think a lot more about what youre doing but its far from impossible if you have the skillsand no mwds in missions are baaaad as you said they do basically let people kite and ignore a lot of damage hell i have an armor tanked mach that can kite bss with one t2 ab and the fact is many people have adapted just fine with afterburners as in most cases the fact is an mwd simply ruins your cap and cap stability is essential to missionersedit however since this does seem like a silly restriction supported
nope original reason was that back then you could fit multiple mwds and people would literally fly the 5000km between rooms and they would finish missions super fastsince then theyve made the distance larger and change it to clearing rooms not to mention you cant fit multiple mwdstbh it doesnt matter missions are easy enough as it isnull needs to be boosted to be like scorch long range
as a software developer i would like to see the following additions to the igbonjump functionthe most common useage of this would be to reload the page when the user jumps systems gate jb or cynothis would be a very useful function in the creation of intel pages for 00 alliencesexample on jump the page reloads and asks the pilot if the system is clear or notdrag and dropallowing drag and drop would help website creators a huge amount and many waysit would be useful for item calculations like refiningreprocessing calculators it would also be useful to drag and drop characters for use again in intel systemsexample the pilot drags and drops his loot inventory into a page and the page then works out the mineral value of all the itemsauth key headerthis would be used to authenticate a pilotat the moment the igb headers are much to easy to fakeexample everytime the user load a page or if thats a bit much everytime they load the browser the header is assigned a random value that when queried in the api would provide confirmation the pilot is who he says he isenhansed trust stuffin addition to the standard trust items there could also be enhanced trust item which a pilot can allow a website to see if they fully trust the creatorhoster and would prompt the user every time they are requested unlike standard trust which last foreverthese could be things likeprovideing the current ship fitting string which would be useful for fcs to find out what they really have in the fleetprovideing the pilots limited api key which would save the pilot alot of copy and paistingwell that is all i can think of right nowlet me know your opinionsand yes i know a couple of these are on evelopedia but still i like to remind ppl whats needed

spend a few more hours on the actual gamedesignchoosing clicks as the gameplay throttle is probably one of the more stupid choices availableplayers should be throttled without requiring them to destroy their hands clicking extractorsgames are meant to be funonly homer simpson and 5yos finds wackamole fun
supported either with the drag box or select them like we do inventory items to keep things consistentpeople will still have to check their planets every depletion cycle but it wont be a 100 mouse click ordeal
have 3 toons 15 planets at the moment you go crazy and if you become elite you cannot even upgrade them no you must set all 15 planets up again with on each of the planet 15 extractors so in all 225 extractors with max of 270 if all characters can do 6 planets per character if you max your skillsak so every day 2 hours of extracting

changed it back i ment to type it like that they have every right to report she broke the nda it is a real and serious nda breachin case you missed it ccp didnt make them sign a contract for the hell of it ccp is a real company and the csm is told what is considered by ccp trade secrets and information on how eve is ran things most of us guess about what all of a sudden because she signed an nda about a game as a volunteer staff member it isnt real or serious stop being so dense ccp isnt a game they make games and she went and disclosed information she shouldnt have her actions should have real world consequences as they have real world consequences for ccp as they should it is a real nda breach it was said quite a few times even by ankh herself that it wasnt related to her recent publications on her blog it also has nothing to do with her being a carebear being controversial or not being a member of a power block alliance why in the wolrd would you think that because a bunch of dumb form trolls said so stop already with the baseless and stupid reasons for her being kicked
same
ah yes i see what you meant i didnt read it that way i think we actually agree 100liang
oh well in that case sorry for the rant lol
keep it civil pleasebreach of nda can be a good reason to dismiss someone but it certainly isnt in all cases we could already have determined this if ccp had given a little extra informationthat someone is a volunteer doesnt matter that a company can be restricted in her doings ive explained in my second point so i wont repeat itshe works in the netherlands and with the jobprotection workers have around here i dont see her fired over this easily unless this breach involved both ccp and her employer her boss already already knows she has a controversial background because she was 2 on the pirat party list at the national elections a month ago the legal risk is thus low legal feesdamages seldom get above 100ke in the netherlands btwhaving countered all your arguments and having motivated that there is an legal obligation on the side of ccp towards the players i think ccp must release a decent motivation on why they dismissed herif they cannot motivate it then logically there is no valid reason and they should let her back in and search for a way to deal with the obviously damaged mutual trust
no its not you breach the nda and get caught youre out and maybe you get sued you dont get to breach the nda and then just go on and be on the council for another 10 months yes it is it shows that a volunteer made an agreement with ccp and broke it one way or another 1 motivate does not mean what you think it means 2 ccp gave us a decent reason why they canned her she broke the nda 3 the nda it was broken by her 4 by her the nda was broken 5 nda dun broke ank be breakin it man
what he said  what do you mean can be a good reason it is a good reason no questions asked if you sign a contract agreeing not to disclose information and you disclose said information in any way shape or form be it harmless or not you broke the contract and are liable for it and all the consequences for doing so by this i take it you mean that a company can be restricted from what rules they are allowed to enforce on someoneim sorry but as long as the contract between eva and ccp doesnt break any laws of the country she is in then its legal and binding ccps lawyers would have known that and had the case been that it was not a legal contract in the netherlands then ccp would not have allowed her to take part in the csm to begin withif i was her boss and another fairly major company such as ccp cited her for breaking an nda her job would at very least be on the line and she would most likely be fired if you cant trust your employees with your company secrets they dont need to be your employees thats just common sensedespite my personal feelings regarding the matter she made her bed let her sleep in itthey did release a decent motivation on why they dismissed her in case you missed it she broke the ndanow do they have to prove it to you or these forums no if she takes it to court then they will have to prove that to a court of law all of which will most likely be behind closed doors to protect ccps interests at most you would get an guilty or not guilty and the rest of the information would be locked away
how sweet i knew that somewhere there was someone that thought aaa had no influence on their citizens and that pl members have no alts while we at it i will have to burst your bubble even more sweetie  us girls  we do um  pee  poo anf pass wind occasionally  sorry
why do you so desperately want there to be something that incriminates ccp is it so hard to believe that the love of your life has done something wrong
why is the rest of the csm trollingflaming this  just let the thread die and get forgotten as most threads of this type are
if i was a gm i would lock some threads
i am running a secret plan that involves loads of mutated hamsters and a duplication of the eve cluster it will also involve me making millions mUFFFDUFFFDllions of dollars and sipping pina coladas for the rest of my life there is one problem however and that is that these mutated hamsters do not eat mere hamster food no they feed on two very rare elements lulz and drama and i feared that my evil plan was doomed to fail because of a lack of these two vital elements much to my relief however ankhmas has provided me with a near infinite supply of both lulz and drama and i am harvesting them greedily as we speak therefor it is in my best interests that these threads be perpetuated as long as possible so i can complete my evil plan and feed all the hamsters
inappropriate language removedapplebabeedit inappropriate language was blocked by the inappropriate language filter i would have thought unless the asterisk is now inappropriate tooredux possibly because ankhesencopypasta was by many reports an individual perceived to have personality traits which meant it was difficult to work around let alone with her and theyre secretly or not relieved as a consequence of her removal and hopeful that future csm operations can be more constructive for the benefit of allim not answering your question with the above by the way im not a member of the csm so i can hardly take it upon myself to explain what they in particular post herenot that ive really noticed any trolling from them compared to the majority of the rest of this thread
posting to confirm that each member of nmg has a average of 35 alts and this is how we got mynx in
she wasnt timid when she called pvpers for mentally unstablethe proff that she did  up is in her silenceits only her alts fanclub that thinks anyone else dosnt belives cpps story
well sokratesz the answer is simple like others on this thread i care about fairness both ingame and out a rush to judgment aptly demonstrate why we do not leave important ethical legal and policy decisions up to crowds im not sure you appreciate how much your continued trolling undercuts your own credibility this is so whether ank is guilty or innocent it also makes it difficult for other members of the csm to maintain credibility in the face of widespread skepticism about the csm process itself this has already been called to your attention by the chair of the csm please consider that before posting next time delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
because delilah is ankhes alt its not the first time she has used alts to defend herself
if thats true she has been doing so very neatly mad props lol get off your ing high horse ccp ruled that she violated their trust enough so as to kick her off the csm and considering that we havent been told more and that she herself stays quiet about it we can assume that it was done so rightfully as liang nuren has already explained elsewhere ccp also has no obligation to tell us anything about the circumstances precisely because of the legal implications of an nda violation thats ok with me i dont need any credibility with people like you i did and i lold and then posted anyway
i see that people are still laboring under the delusion that ccp is accountable to the player base for its actions in this casethe csm exists solely because ccp wants it to csm members serve at the pleasure of ccp the fact that they have to sign an nda at all supports this the fact that players vote for individual members means nothing more than that the most popular for whatever reason players are the ones who are permitted to serve on the csm your vote is a privilege of your having an eve account and is a standalone benefit that implies nothing not even the assurance that next year youll have anything to vote for ccps allowing you to vote does not place you on the board of directors nor give you any right or say in how ccp conducts its business including how it administrates the csm anymore than voting for the name of nasas newest iss module gives you a say in what color they decide to paint it even announcing that it was an nda violation is frankly more than the company was ethically required to announcei also love how people trying to make themselves sound important are demanding that ccp disclose the nature of the nda violation while insisting that they dont need to give details as if that makes any sense whatsoever what a bunch of morons theres only one kind of nda violation disclosing protected information thats literally it the only possible way to break an nda anything more specific than that is a detailbut do not interrupt your tirades on my account thereve been more tears in this single thread than ive seen in almost an entire year of ninjaing
its awesome
with as many times as sokratesz has posted in this thread you would think he was the one removed and not ankhesentapemkah anyone have a count on his post in this thread alone he is on every page multiple times

ive wondered about that too especially in light of a comment made by mynxee in a recent post on her blog life in low sec she says it seems clear that sokratesz is ignoring ccps request and mynxees common sense delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
moar qq delilah mooaaaarrr
normally only molle gets a threadnaught like thisdeck
you are again wholly mistaken what they mean is the details of the nda breach which quite unironically are under nda for now
dude shes not mistaken she knows shes wrong and shes just trolling yet again its hardly surprising shes gone back into school marm mode and is trying to find something anything to scold people with what mynxee said something scold scold scold scold what some csm members saiddid different things scold scold scold that all the scolding is for people who are critical of ank is just a coincidence naturally mynxee says that ccp asked the csm not to discuss specifics of the nda breach okay well then surely sok can be scold scold scolded for something or other that has nothing to do with the nda breach because well mynxee said something and ccp and well scold scold scold beware the school marm and her ruler of doom just like the troll claimed that while you were probably lying if ank really did throw a spoon at anybody else then why shed support ank being removed from the csm except not only did she not do that she immediately began requesting that instead you be removed from the csm dnftt
so csm obviously has more info every indication points to pretty clearobvious nda breach which is to be expected given ccps official post i remain impressed with ccps hardball approach although admittedly we dont know if some kind of hushhush resolution was first attempted crappy situation all around shame on eva pity for ccp and lulz at the csm for not only having to suffer through impotence but now gag orders and bilateral attacks as wellthis games pretty damn cool
yes yes indeed it is
this concerns me despite the fact that she was completely unlikeable ankh seemed to be the only person who gave a toss about fixing fw
perhaps if shed been more likable shed have actually gotten it done instead of offending the ccp director per her own blog post also we dont have the minutes yet and theres more than one fw supporter in the csmliang
liesblatant lies and trickeryrabble rabble
if the votes are anything to go by she was likeable
dear delilahyoure beyond starting to annoy me with your idioicity and pompous naiveteyoure now on my  listleil
my requirements are rather strict the csm candidate must amuse me in some way dance for me my puppets dancewhich oddly enough the nowex csm member who amused me greatly i did not vote for so that just goes to show you
the csm i would vote for would be one that has experience with a wide span of gameplay stylesim interesting in a living world where different players and playstyles can coexist in a balanced way because thats what makes eve unique and interesting my kind of candidate would work for the good of eve and not for a specific gamestyle or player factioni was pleasantly surprised that trebor daehdoow got elected since he seems to be a candidate that is at least for now beyond personal agendas i disagree with some of his visions and ideas but i like the wellrounded approach he hasalthough most of the current csm seems to have left the limited agendas behind and have started having a broader view thats a very positive development
i agree that trebor is a very good candidate but i dont believe that there are any members with a personal agenda at the moment
thats actually amazingly fast not so much because its 28 pages but because you have to circulate it to so many people nice job csm
just give it up the csm is a massive waste of time  demonstrabley so 300 issues outstanding and confirmation ccp are allocating no time to deal with them  all your doing is adding to a big list of items ccp wont bother implementing for at least two  three years if ever whilst provind ccp some pr cover to wave at traditional media occasionalywhilst your zealousness is to be applauded  the white elephant has bolted to mix metaphores  loooooong time ago no mater how much effort you put in  the door aint worth shuttingno one appreciates the work your doing  voters or ccp
and this 28 page document gets the player base what exactly itll get exactly the same as the other 28 page documents created in the past  a few folks will get all warm and fuzzy the gms will sit around and collectively go well done some good and valid points there and then it gets filed away in a rubbish bin for the cleaners to take care of in the morningyou may get lucky and hit on something that ccp was planning to release anyway and bingo you get a credit against your names as having done something but its pretty much going to luck and not good work tbqhso kudos to you all for the hard work that has gone into this and all the other docs im sure someone somewhere may care
itt people thinking they know how to spend ccps money better than ccp itself
yes yes they are like i could spend it on icecream instead of eveanother failed expansion or 2 and we might all decide icecream is more valuable then eve online
what id like to see for the next csm is for those elected to csm6 take the free trip and upon return all promtly quit all youd have to say to the eve community we decided to take this action because eve players know nothing will be done nothing will be fixed or implemented by ccp the eve community will aplaud you on this bold move hey i might run on this platform for csm6 hahaha
can i have your stuff when you finally leave
the people that want the csm disbanded are just trolls first ccp does not owe you anything you pay for the game as it is ccp does not owes you any change or fixsecond ccp decides to use the csm as a mean to have structured feedback from the playerbase structuring feedback and prioritizing requests is the only thing that would give a somewhat accurate vision of the desires of the playerbase then you can decide to thank ccp for this or stfu this is after all their game all the forum whine cannot be seen as a coherent playerbase will while the csm goal is just to tell ccp what the playerbase wants in a coherent structured prioritized way and i think they succeeded in this and last to resume the csm is the only way players have to interact with ccp in a trustable way look at it as the least bad if you dont want the csm keep on complaining on the forums between troll threads speculations noobish or carebear cries and so on
your perception of what these forums are for is clearly off please take your sense and reason elsewhere sir
what a bold statement from someone who said cause does not matter only consequencestop waving that useless csm badge and go harvest your plantation
now selling sarcasm detectors starting at 2999
the nda hinders the operation of the csm for all the claims of transparency this is a major issue edited minutes only breed suspicion and distrust in the electoratethe csm cannot operate properly with an ndaccp cannot operate properly without an ndathere is a huge conflict of interest here it needs resolving sharpish ive never voted in the elections i cannot see the point ccp would be better off selecting 15 players at random to be the csmperhaps another level needs to be introduced here 200 players in an assembly to help funnel ideas to the csm the csm will then negotiate with ccp on those issuesanyway my point is i dont see my tax isk working here so time to shut down or refocus the project
if the csm want to do something constructive to really grab ccps and the players attention you should all resign preferably the same day what do you think would happen if you did that
well after you made this statement it is pretty obvious you are only interested in protecting your free trip to icelandmaybe there is progress being made with some of the csm members in actually acknowledging that it is only a free trip to iceland and that they have no influence over ccp whatsoeverwell they might provide some entertainment for ccp staff akin to being a group of court jesters in behaving like someone cares about what they say however once the csm figures that out it will most likely be the end of it as ccp will have lost the entertainment value of the csmand seriously if you thought ccp actually listened to this group of clowns you are sadly mistaken no respectable software production house in the world takes its player base seriously for any suggestions  that in itself would be game breaking
well if ccp would be a country and they would have cut a person with a majority of the vote out of the goverment for some reasons that they dont wanna explain it would be also no more a democracy more like a military dictatorship of the goverment with a puppet democracy goverment i give rothrin right in this case ccp should think about a new election if they make a thing like that or give the people a real reaspn why they push out the second most wanted csm  so ppl can decide if the csm decision was a good one or a bad one and decide if new votes are neccesarily or not anything else is just a bad joke 
please bear with me  havent done this in a while
came to thread expecting mynx caught miningleft not entirely diapointedmynxee is the chairwoman btw ahnk only got second place
lol only speaking the truth is that like tellin it like i sees it or just sayinsok dealt with the issue like a kid readteen would csm standing behind that would make them all look immature
actually no if youre talking about spoongate i told it exactly as it happened totally objectively
the question here might be why was it mentioned at alloh sure it was the truth thats what happenedbut im sure a lot of other things happened as well eg someone barfed farted sneezed coughed dropped a fork during dinner made an inappropriate commentjoke etc so why tell about spoongate and not about some of the other things that had no impact on the results as well
some people cant handle the truth  but thats not my problem this was one of the remarkable things she did while in iceland and only one of two that i found worth mentioning because i didnt want to hurt her reputation too much
you only wanted to hurt her reputation a little
given her attitude and behaviour in the past i felt like it was appropriate to report on this matter which involved another longtime csm member meissa but you dont have to agree with it thats ok with me i appreciate your rage but please tell me why should incidents like this be swept under the rug its not like she had a lot of credit to begin with
there is no rage only curiosityreasons to ignore such incidents could be to avoid giving the impression to be a group that cannot work together without petty drama ankh did that one might even argue that this information is only suitable to create conflict but nothing more its not like this would have removed her from the csm or made ccp ignore her or void her voteno this would only have negative effects on how the csm is perceived by others namely playersi find it rather amazing that such trivia are given attentionthis is something that can be dealt with within the csmso this has only increased the impression of the csm being a group of people that kill time together unable to overcome normal differencesdifficulties to work towards a goalthats not saying throwing objects is okaybut throwing mud is not okay either
think about that for a bit seriously see if what you said makes sense if we should ignore facts that show that someone in a group cannot work with the other members without causing petty drama are we really avoiding giving a mistaken impression or are we actually covering up the facts because of how we fear theyll be received 1 one might argue that but itd be a silly argument showing how a excsm member behaved is part of transparency and keeping the players updated on how their elected representatives are working if every attempt at transparency is met with claims that its only going to create conflict obviously the answer then is to cover everything up for pr reasons so as to keep control of information of public perception this is a rather bad thing to do 2 your argument that only things which should be reported are those that would remove someone from csm or get ccp to ignore them or void their votes is an absurdity part of accountability and transparency is keeping tabs on how elected reps are behaving and whats going on and keeping that on the record imagine if instead of being removed for violating the nda ank has stuck around through this entire term what would the difference be if at the very end of the csm some people said oh yeah and she was difficult to work with through the process versus having a paper trail of documentation through the months showing what actually happened by your argument we shouldnt even be shown the minutes and raw text of a meeting 3 anybody who judges an entire group by the behavior of one of their members is operating on a cognitive level so low as to discredit themselves immediately such sloppy thinking is the basis of every bit of prejudice bigotry and racism through history its just dumb anybody who looks at a group of several people and sees one behaving badly and then says that entire group is bad is the kind of a person whose time can most profitably be spent counting grains of sand on a beach and leaving the grownups alone again this makes no sense if we have say 100 people who form the galactic senate or whatever 99 of them routinely work together and get stuff done and one throws temper tantrums whenever they dont have a vote go their way and they also throw things at other people they dont like does his mean that the entire galactic senate cannot function or that theyre actually doing pretty well and one rogue loon cant get with the program this is not rocket science google fallacy of composition and fallacy of division theyre not called fallacies because theyre awesome arguments honestly this ankwhiteknight meme has to die already you cant criticize ank or show how shes behaving or the entire csm is all for naught is just silly shes gone already people can stop wking for her
so a grand total of 40k of players actually voted of which probably half to two thirds are player 2nd and 3rd accounts supposition i know but hard to prove either way but a fairly good estimate from my experience so if you take the total number of active subs currently in eve as say around the 350k mark that leaves you with a figure of under 10 actually participated as a high figure assuming that a larger amount of single players without 2nd and 3rd accounts voted than those with 2nd3rd accounts of that then just over 10 went to the top vote getter so essentially you get to be chairman of the csm with under 01 support of the player base guess it pays to be a cool kid to get into these things

trolls angry vets who are protecting learning skills sound like this to me so faroh god please dont let eve evolve even if learning skills were a mistake and are just broken mechanics dont let them remove it please let me play a broken game also i strongly disagree with the removal of learnings since they will lower the steep learn curve a bit for the newbies hell no dont let newbies ever have a chance to start playing i want the game all for myself
would make eve a better game and provide a fair solution to everyone
seems to my simple mind that the basic issue getting more people into lowsec can only be solved when the hard core pirate crowd put asside the testosterone for a second and discuss how low sec can be made at least partially safer for those there who dont want to fight while not being too safeeven the discussions that focus on increasing the rewards available in lowsec as some isk based way of tempting people into it doesnt work since all that means is the hard core pvp element living there get access to more isk to buy badder ships to  those who would only go there occasionalyfrom all ive seen though any attempted discussion about even slightly making lowsec safer for those wanting to avoid a fight is howled down by screams of stop crying and sfupersonnaly i dont hate it as is despite only seemingly going there to die but either stop looking for ways to improve lowsec or turn down the testosterone enough to have the conversation cant have both
this in no way endorses lowsec getting safer it should be dangerous thats the whole point of ithowever it shouldnt be danger just from pirates it should be danger for th epirates as well with anti pirate cartels running areas even industrialists manning up and actually arranging security and building a lowsec industrial fortress im sure anti pirates and other more lawful people would either help or hire out to a strong industrial forcelowsec should be about everyone who wants to live there i myself am a pirate and always have been but i would love to see better anti piracy a mining fleet that is defended by a real fleet who are actually expecting a fightit isnt about piracy its about total lowsec put the rewards there for strong industrials put the bounty hunter and smuggler careers to usegive lowsec the blast of life it so much deserves and lacksit needs to be dangerous because hisec is so safe it should also reward those brave enough or big enough to face that dangercontrary to popular belief there are already people like this multi faceted allaicnes and not pirates who are strong enough to live there but it needs more reward more reason and more uniqueness as a place
supportedccp like any other game company is in it for the money i dont see them not liking this idea with the only difficulty of coding it fairly into any already complex database this is a good alternative to sticking around to watch paint dry skill training which is one of the largest turn offs of eve online to mainstream mmo players naturally it be only one character per account as you could only train one character at a time and coding to divide bought time between alts would be extra man hours also adding this feature then brings into question about other features like buying of sp in advance god only knows how the veterans of this game would cry bloody tears and emoragequit if that happened but i dont think its out of the question either the only reason theyd be ing is the loss of advantage and closing the gap to a more balanced playing field which was one of the main ideas behind t3 ships in their reduced training time over tech 2 ships the mmo world is heading to micro transactions with free game play and this couldwould be one of the features to add to ccps micro transaction storeanything that closes the gap between those that started at retail release and those that came later i am in full support as long as i can use plex to pay for the feature p
dont make suggestions until you have thought of every way it can be abused and propose fixes for themedit actually having read abit more i would support a 12 month version of this for the simple purpose of rl issues there is no way it should ever be for a yearto easily abused
i took a long break because of various issues which i had no direct control over being offered the chance to get back sps i had to leave behind with my hiatus yes please and thanks you i will be the first in line throwing my money at ccp for this i see the opponents have failed to make their case you know ccp have their own awesome ways for not being santa claus i am not worried one bit over thisim in
what i think the original poster is proposing is allowing players to buy skillpoints for their characters but imposing a cap you cant buy more than x skillpoints because your character was only created y days agoi am ambivalent about this plan
im a 2003 character i stopped playing for nearly two years 20052007 so im two years behind on trainingi do not support this proposali made the choice to cancel my subscription at the time and i choose to live with the consequences of the decision

blasters need tracking or dps boost not range they are supposed to kill everything stupid enough to be in their optimal currently they dontblasters do pwn in eft wars tho like the 1000dps brutix mentioned many times defence against that is shooting at it it has absolutley no tank and dies instantly you just need to shoot it
supported
i was mostly referring to hms torps got a niche if anything i would like a cm remap to make them more useful in pvpwhy blasters should be in between assuming you sitting on some very focused skill points and you have blaster ships fully maxed for the useful hulls for me the question is when i can use this sp exactly for the reason i invested it in this niche again instead of having it for a more random role where i can do with other stuff just fine atm i dont see the problem in the niche dont like it dont skill it however i see a problem about how blaster ships this days perform in her niche well my pest still does 12kmsas for general blaster ships yes you are right you are also spot on in the point that the bigger problem is delivering the dps mostly the medium sized blaster ships rax diemost brutix astarte all of them lack a solid dps advantage outside of neutron shield gank fitshowever as a former 16k dps mega pilot the number is far less impressive outside of eft this days for solo work and even for small gangs other ships are pretty close if you go for a similar gank fitaiming for 2k would require 30 dps increase i dont think this much is really needed if ccp looks into the other problems but 1015 are pretty much required to give a useful level of dps advantage i do however completely agree here that is why i did mentioned the stopping power at point blank with the web what is the main reason they are not as good in her niche as they where pre qr daysyeah not stellar but useful
supported hybrids just arent worth the training time at the moment far too narrow a niche
supporting this is worth as much as supporting other hybrid threads imho however a ferox is a good ship you fit ions on it and youre going to pimp in scram range that ship has sick shield tank and dps compareable to a 1600mm cane etc while being tier 1but yeah matari ships get same dps numbers as ie galls while using projectiles being more cap stable faster and easier to fitbalance my assimho gall would hit fotm if they could separate ships get in  get out thoraxs mwd bonus would be usefull then right now its separate get in and do same dps as ships with bigger range so youre just embarasing yourself a hybrid boost would help caldari i enjoy my moa and ferox but they need loveedityeah the boost range topic is complete bull add damage tracking and itll be the way hybrids should bealso remove  bonuses like mwd bonus on thorax tracking bonus on tristan and change to a falloff bonus cause youve changed evry ing thing around these bonuses and they render completely useless right now tracking on mega is fine it fights in scram and large turrest have range repair bonuses are working fine too just boost damage on hybrids so you can make up for the time it takes to bring your slow gallente and caldari ass to the target

thumbs downop fails to take in account the system as a whole put your blinders on and exclude everything outside your narrow view but we are not talking about logistics ships and then complain when your post is dismissed by a csm member for being the ridiculous and unreasoned idea that it is further resort to personal attacks on the professionalism character and usefulness of a csm because you dont have any good facts to back up your rr module argument
the only numbers i gave are fitting requirements and they are the only numbers that are relevant you on the other hand fail to give me any examples of anything of importance that has been excluded by by narrow view and not taken into account be specific if you want your opinion to be considered what is the system as a whole the whole of eve just for your information i the op havent made a personal attack on a csm member and only got annoyed after 10 posts of UFFFD dont know wtf you are talking about and this sucks without any further explanation and complete absence of any constructive criticism i have demonstrated that i am open to criticism but instead i get some bul
actually he is right there is a lot more that matters here besides the fitting requirements but for some reason you do not want to take it into account
but you wont tell us what these arethanks for taking this forum seriously
the problem with the remote shield transfer gangs excluding logistics is not the module its the ships most bs gangs use sniper ships which are mostly armor tanked the only exception being the rokh which basically must be shield tanked if anything at all something should be made to make shield tanking more widespread in the bs bracket because it sure is no problem in the bccruiser bracket nano gangs and drake gangs are both shield tanked
you might want to train your reading skills i have already elaborated on this earlier
can someone please explain this attitude to me sok was posting before he was csm and hell probably continue to post afterwards as well in addition where does the idea that csm members cant have or express opinions and thoughts of their own come from its patently ridiculous especially considering that they ran on platforms constructed from their thoughts and ideas quite frankly i wish more csm would be involved visibly with the assembly hall considering how central it should be to the councilanyways as someone who voted for sok i am quite pleased with his representation so far would vote again
oh god im agreeing with a now what has the world come toyour numbers are interesting butyou say shield logistic ships are fine and are of course using the modules in questionbut shield rrbs gangs are notif the module itself is truly the issue surely it would affect logistics ships and we would not see themif you do not see a specific group of modules being used in a certain situation ie rrshield bs then perhaps either the modules are not meant for that but they are or the ships onto which they are meant to go arnt fit rightbeyond the fact that shields regenerate naturally etc etc etc shield logis work therefore perchance the problem is in the ships shield bs beinga little light in the mid slot department and cpu
see its not that difficult thank you
i had an idea of accepting missios in space like epic arch missions are done a skill simular to the remote sensing skill for planet management it would alow a person to accept decline and delay missions while they are in space so a person can stay out for a lenght of time to do missions
2nd response to tavinpart 1 wellif you get rid of skills relating to attributes aka learning skills than there is no attachment to what is cloned to preserve your attributes when you get podded therefore no contradiction to the lore would exist in deed the evelore has quite well established the disorientation and other traumas related to emergency cloning that can and sometimes quitedrastically alter a clones personality and attributesbut not his skills as a capsuleer which through the technology he is more attached to and aware of than his own soul indeed some very powerful subplots in the empyean age book were rooted in this whole experience of cloningrebirth and in that lore they dont just hop back into a ship 22 seconds after dying they live as people not as internetspaceships presenting perfect opportunities to work on your charisma or logic or willpoweretc  basically if i thought my idea broke evecannon completelyi wouldnt have proposed it in the first place i could be wrong but i personally believe my idea is more in sync with lore than the current learning skill mechanic is also podding wouldnt reset you to 0 in every category as that would mean youre a human vegetablebut just whatever the base is for a new clones ultimately my idea is rooted in the physical nature of the mind and its attachment to the bodya mind in sync with its body performs better translated to game playattributes buffs a mind out of sync with its body does not perform at its peakbecause the body is the powerplant for the mind translated to game playattributenerfs being ripped from one body and put into another would take some time adjusting toeven if you retained your memories and skillsets from your previous life and going further a person to long connected to a ship can possibly loose himself in that shipand become not at all aware of his own physical existenceand could possibly lead to insanity leading to the possibility in gameplay of random attribute takeaways from intentional logoffs in space making a logoffski something of consequencethat said none of the consequences i propose prevent someone from attempting logoffskis or logging off in space or risking a glorious podding its just something to weigh as you make choices in eve and everything im proposing is rooted to actually having incarna in the framework so i admit my idea really has no merit till then but i think its very relevant to the lore and the potential gameplay opportunities
2nd response to tavenpart 2plus it presents endless social possibilities one example you get podded you wake up in station you look at your skill in training and say i need to improve my logic you go to the plaza and play some kind of logic game with some new player who has just started eve for the first time hes working on his logic skills too but for the first time you actually pvp the kid using real logic and you can have real dialog with him if you think he has real potential based on his skillbased performance against you and on your conversations you invite him to join your corp and he does it all becomes an awesome platform for player interaction in which no one is trying to kill each other because they are busy buffing their attributes before they go out in space again but everyone still has there own agendas and that scenario repeats itself with others all around as they are gaining charisma or memory or willpower etc of course people with multiple accounts and programmers who are thinking about the prospect of creating games for each attribute probably will hate this idea entirely players with multiple accounts probably want to train up those attributes one time and keep them high for infinity programmers probably want to focus more on eve than a series of minigames to buff attributes so i actually expect a lot resistance to this idea but still i think its pretty goodangle the kind of angle incarna needs to actually be worth doing in the first place because its something that no one would be able to metagame or be able to accomplish from inside the pod of course for the sake of balance there would need to be a cap on what you can achieve through those minigames for each attribute and people who are better at them say they beat their opponent or opponent should claim the attribute chain faster than those who perform poorly once a person is maxed out on that chain they should still be allowed to play those games for social interaction purposes or practice or recreation maybe even for sportywagers but they wont get a buff from continued exercise because theyve reached their peak and only implants can assist them furtherall in all itd be like adding a whole new game to evewhich is so much better than learning skills and even a little bit better in my opinion than focused training
you mean like they have to do already with learning skillsor do you mean stat focused training which is already a reality with stat respecing i dont see how this would change anythingas for herschels malcanis law objection vets are already training at the maximum possible rate because of the aforementioned respeccing and because weve already done our learning skills were not going to train any faster because of this idea or if we do trivially so the law would only apply if this change made new players train nonlearning skills significantly more slowlyyou can also balance it toward new players with a simple diminishing returns feature eg it takes 5000 sp in an int primary skill to raise int by 1 but another 10000 sp to raise it by 2 then another 15000 to raise it by 3 etc etc doesnt have to be linear progression could be algebraic asymptotic whatever seems to work best detailsas for people who have already trained learning skills we could start them at the point of the progression ladder that their current skills imply so in the example above if someone has learnings at 44 then they need 5000  8 x 5000  45000 sp in a stat primary skill to raise that statas for the new system cunfuzzling the evemon guys well i dont think eves design should be limited by the requirements of 3rd party apps plus im pretty sure that they could cope with it the maths neednt be that hard
i like the way this discussion is nicely distanced from the never ending learning skills dramahowever i dont see big sense in the idea if any the reason is it gives us perfect tautology  in order to train some skils you need to train said skills and that is allmore detailedfirst i dont think bonusing of this kind should last forever the more sp you get the faster you train without any efforts or choices to be made this goes opposite to the diminishing returns principleif that bonus has a cap then essentially it is the same as applying additional attribute points just stretched in time if we have a skill set a say intmem based and we need it we will not train not needed skill set b just because it is also intmem based and will give us bonuswe will just train the same set a  because it gives exactly the same bonus plus the skills itself there is no choices to be madeso the proposal in an essence has the same effect as giving attributes for free like it is proposed for learning skills replacement but apparently requires more sophisticated codingon a different point of view proposed system may have some merit it would provide a reward assuming bonus is capped for a players who play longer than some fixed term thus encouraging to become a longterm playersif the game needs encouraging of this kind is an another discussion personally i am not exactly sure
just a quick post to let you all know i have not abandoned this topic i appreciate all the support and criticism this topic idea has received both have been extremely constructive i expect to reply to the latest posts within the next 24 hours
no this is a terrible idea
this is a tough one to avoid people will always minmax and powergame this is probably one factor i had to ignore reason being im not a programmer or educatedtrained game designer so i have no idea how hard a feature like this would be to impliment for all i know its going to require months of work or possibly a few hours definitely agree one aim was to deter people from just powergaming and spending the first few months training these learning skills it is very efficient but it limits your actions while other necessary skills are on hold the advantage is the extreme amount of time thatll be savedanother option as you suggest is to mix and match between learning skills and practical skills the idea tries to really enhance that to give you that attribute bonus in what feels like a more active approach
its a good idea i found while training learning skills made sense lorecontext wise actively training yourself like you suggest would be fun and more involving some of those attributes would be a little academic training intelligence might just be from reading but something like memorylogic well weve all seen things like nintendos brain trainerhave you proposed this idea in the main hallthis post really helps specify what im trying to convey and how the idea can be altered accordingly the idea itself was pretty general as i was just trying to express an approach rather than state a specific solutioncapped was something i mentioned initially the reason i suggested that was to mirror the current system you can only train your attributes so high with skills and implants since this idea is meant to modify the current system slightly rather than completely change itcould you be more constructive please others have rejected the idea and posted very credible and constructive reasons why someone even posted the ideas prime weakness just credit everyone the bonus attributes since thats basically what will happen to vets with my idea anyway and new players wouldnt even know it any other way
i like this idea the way i see it you could have the stat bonuses at bonus squared times one millionthus youd only need 1m sp in a skill with intelligence primary to get 1 intelligence and secondary attributes would increase at half that ratehowever for level 4 it would take 16m sp or 32m secondary for level 7 it would take 49m at level 10 it would take 100m spoverall this seems to be an elequent way to represent focused skill training without having the learning skills present the only issue is what to do with the sps currently spent in the learning skills that people have already trained especially the newer playersmy solution to this would be to give characters under 6 months old their full sp back in those skills for characters 6 months to a year they get 75 back for characters beyond that they get half back as theyve already earned a significant value for the sps spentsupported and it seems to be the best answer for the learning skills problem which even ccp admits needs to be changedupdate corrected the multiplier on the calculations
rant onim all for hulkageddon i want that to be known straight off the bat the problem comes when it turns into a kill any ships remotely associated with miningageddonive been in the hulkageddon 3 channel the past few days and have seen them attacking and destroying any ship mounting a mining laserstrip miner ships from as small as a bantam to as large as an orca an orca where did orcas come into play in hulkageddon ive asked them in that channel that if i were to put mining lasers on a ferox and went out to go mine would they attack me i was told youre friedwrong answeri just personally think this has gotten out of hand and needs to be reined in significantlyrant off
you sir did not realise this is the wrong forum section to post a rant
im also all for hulkageddonbut the recycled destroyer alts need to be banned along with their mains if you want to gank hulks or any mining ship for that matter it should be done with a character thats more than just a lol investmentccp has already said that recycled alts strictly for the purpose of suicide attacks is an exploit and subject to banning it should be enforced
and your suggestion that should get csms attention is exactly what
first did you lose a feroxorcasecond how
yah this would be the suggestion and purpose of this thread the enforcement of the rules  regulations that ccp has set forth for hulkageddon absolutely anything less becomes griefingwhich is against the terms  conditions of eve online
im no fan of hulkageddon either but where do you draw the line of when biomassing an alt is a bannable offense i think its not able to be enforcable in any real waymy personal feeling is that indys need less vulnerability so they cant be suicide ganked by cheap ships if they gank your bantam they lose money indies in general shouldnt be as fragile as they are
whinego back to hko
go back to what
while i doa gree that people are getting stupid and i hate when 1day alts are used i dont see what csm can do about it
social and psychological behaviour are more in favour of me sure people wish to be safe and try every selfish method to survive but in the end this is a gamemaybe ccp should remove pvp since psychologically speaking violence is wrong what am i saying 00 is without pvp
out of personal curiosity of course i would support this but then this is one of those things which i doubt ccp would ever be willing to negotiate on so it doesnt really matter what any of us think tbhben
ccp gave a reason that reason was breach of the ndawell no breach of nda was the instrument under which ccp removed the individual they accuse of doing something which was the reason for acting and no i know thats not the legal attitude but ccp have an ethical responsibility to their employees who are also covered by ndas and have a right to know the way in which ccp wield them and the paying player community alsothe reason for the dismissal could be any of a million reasons and disclosing actual details is not necessary to give some openness to the process and could include for example having deliberatelyaccidently disclosed future product information same for technical technicques programming etc ccp financial information undisclosed losses etc undisclosed information about ccp employeesdirectorsccp could easily just say dissemination of information about as yet unanounced product development and everyone would back off or anyone reasonable would untill a later time when the information is no longer secretto say it cant be discussed and leave it at that is absurdndas are usually such broadly worded documents that they can be used to cover just about anything if you want to twist them far enough so saying whatever it is was covered by the nda means zero
the exact contents of an nda are usually covered by it liang nuren took the time and effort to explain all this quite nicely in one of the related threads you should really look it up if you are interested
so you have this ship whose main weapon is a cloud generator the ammo for this weapon can come from wormspace or pibasically there are different types of cloud1 cloud which damages everything with in recon 33 sort of deal2 cloud which infuses the ships shield with increased shield res while decreasing armor res3 electronic warfare immunity for all ships but slows ship and blocks warping4 effectively cloaks all ships within but people can see you5 6 profit
check it out a 4chan meme and a terrible idea in one thread somehow i do not think this is random chance

this is about the afterburner skill giving you a bonus that potentially harms you it mainly affects dual propulsion pvp ships but does have some effect on ships using afterburnercloak to hit warp not as common as mwdcloakoriginal thread at
even when untrained an ab uses hardly any capacitor unless oversized you are exchanging a useless effect for an equally useless effecthow about something useful increasing acceleration if formula permits which i am not sure it does why isnt thrust factored into acceleration anyway  silly devs overheat resistance similar to t3 would create some nice synergy with t3 and certain subsystems as well near permaoverheated ab ofirst would make ships nimble little buggers compared to now especially frigate vessels with fast direction changes possiblesecond would allow for pretty high speeds 50 mwd speed with no sig bloom for usable periods
i know it doesnt have a lot of effect but this just means its easy to make this change if you actually implement something different as the current bonus it could make afterburners overpowered or at the very least lead to a testingbalancing cycle that i dont know ccp will want to spend time oni do like your ideas its just more gamechanging than simply changing an outdated bonus
i like the afterburner skill effect because their cap consumption is actually significant on the large models however as long as it decreases the cap consumption by the same amount per level i have no problems with this proposal
against the op cap reduction is practically worthless speed increase instead of longer cycle time would make me happy the longer cycle time helps you when neuted youll still burn out of range untouchable by scams
while we can increase speed that is a blanace move that needs to be considered on different grounds if you get neuted depends if it happens at the end or beginging fo the cycle
short versionthrust as it appears in the attributes of a speed module directly influences the maximum speed of the ship while the speed module is active it penalizes large ships that try to fit small speed modules and rewards small ships that fit large speed moduleslong versionthrust is taken into account in the following mannerafterburningmicrowarping speed  base speed   1  max velocity bonus  thrust in meganewtons  ship mass in kilotons for example suppose a perfect capsuleer hops into a dramiel and throws on a 1mn microwarpdrive ii the dramiels stock speed is 473 ms which is increased to 59125 ms because of navigation 5 so the base speed in the above equation is 59125 msmax velocity bonus for a 1mn microwarpdrive ii is 500 which i will just call 50 here acceleration control 5 brings this up to 625 or 625 the thrust in the attributes is 15 mn that never changes for frigatesize speed modules the mass of a dramiel is 740700 kg which ill call 07407 kilotons but the speed module adds 05 kilotons to the ships mass whenever active so a microwarping dramiel actually has a mass of 12407 kilotonswhat we have then ismicrowarping speed  base speed   1  max velocity bonus  thrust in meganewtons  ship mass in kilotons microwarping speed  59125 ms   1  625  15  12407 microwarping speed  505886 msif a tempest battleship tried the same thing with a tech 2 frigate microwarpdrive also with a perfect capsuleer then we would havemicrowarping speed  base speed   1  max velocity bonus  thrust in meganewtons  ship mass in kilotons microwarping speed  150 ms ms   1  625  15  1038 microwarping speed  16083 mssuch are the effects of thrust and mass with speed modules in eve online
you are 100 missing the point of this proposal this isnt about boosting abs and personally i think their speed is fineits about the fact that the current skill for a longer cycle time can potentially cause you problemsspecifically for me im sure its gotten me killed several times when trying to turn off my ab to warp away afterduring a fight when more enemies show up the longer cycle means it doesnt shut off as fast meaning that the worse agility that comes with an active prop mod sticks around longersuggest cap use bonus sounds fine to me and doesnt change the overall balance of abs which is currently fine at all

fully supportedi demand that the csm steal small but valuable items from ccp claw and hold them hostage until he does his job
i disagree its not like they deserve them
yeah its not like they put hundreds of hours into tournament praticing theorycrafting and hardwork into perfecting their tournament team youre an idiot
no sapport cuz garmon has 2 much 
m8 youre making it sound like hydra deserves nothing maylinbut surely pl deserves their adrestias
i read the op as give hydra their uterus and pl their adenoidsso ill support it on that basis as girls without their whatsits is kinda sad and whiney folks sound better with their ads installed oh yeah forgot we are talking about pl here never mind once they get their gang member onto the csm any allegations of cheatingmacro runningpython injection will all go quietly away vote changed
while i wouldnt be opposed to making a scheme for better tracking of corpowned ships the idea of disabling functionality and forcing players to give the ship back is just not eve if you want to enforce your property rights go enforce them and if you dont then dont let other people get their hands on your ships
the goal is not to enforce property this point is only a means the goal is to allow real team work by securing the result of this workby this corps can really use tax and corp farming operations in advantage of their mates with less risk by this a corp can lend a ship mining barge or bs or rorqual or jumpfreigter or everything else to a new mate she not necessary fully trust cause he is new p the mate can make money faster and corps have new argument to recruit better team spiritteam work better dividends biggest fleets not all people may use this for sure cause eve is full of people thinking they play an individual game in facebook but a part of players are searching for more team work that what i think
i acknowledge that people would find it very useful but what you basically propose is to make peoples ships be someone elses property with restrictions to fit like i said thats not eve possession is 910ths of the law and the other tenth is lag tracking schemes are fine by me but i should be able to use the ship im flying to its fullest extent

all these fix old features threads must get through to ccp at some pointbut the bitter vet in me just laughs at this still signed though
supportedif they wanted something new to add they could put in t3 frigates since they are already planned
everytime ccp fixes broken ships bugs and mechanics they end up making them worse when they fixed highsec missions they simply made most marauders useless when new content is added though imperfect its usually fairly decent like wspacenow people are calling on the same ccp to devote an entire update to fixes this is absurd csm please pass a motion supporting this post to get ccp to focus its next update on adding new content instead of fixing broken existing content
are you completely ed
just a bitter troll who desperatly tries to get at least some attention and social interaction
why is it that pl is the only alliance that ever whines about the prize ships not being handed out fast enough
because theyre whiny gots who realize how it would take about 2 minutes to spawn 20 bpcs and a few billion isk
did ccp start making the ships just now might take them some time then tell their engineers to commission a ship beforehand next time
i just dont get why this is so hard for ccp claw to do i understand the alliance tournaments are a lot of work okay so you maybe take a few days off after the at ends to rest and stuff but weeks or months after the tournament is over and you dont spend 510 minutes to hand out prizes this makes you look incompetent ccp maybe you should look into some better personnel a professional tournament director would have the prizes out within the hour a team wins even a really bad tournament director will have the prizes handed out in a couple of daysfull support for this
why not just have your executor file a petitionmorally supported of course but the csm seems an inappropriate channel for something like this so noedit grammarben
come on ccp every ing time cant you once hand out prizes on time

aside from yourself and the other members of the csm you mean i guess if you keep telling yourself this you may eventually convince yourself that its truebut spare the player base the sarcasm the csm members are there purely for self serving interests and they all have their personal agendas i mean how else are you going to pay back all your supporters in your various power blocs pity though that the facts speak for themselves and that the current csm represents less than 10 of the existing player base and from a game pov represents only one segment of the game  that of the alliance based pvpers such a broad church of players they are

thanks for the update looking forward to reading it and seeing how many of the 28 pages are ccp trying to justify dominion has not horrible messed up everything it tried to do
update in the op csm edits to the minutes are complete ball is in ccps court
nice 3 3 glad i voted for you and sok liang
id be a tiny bit closer to actually serving two or three banks of resignations and i might see daylightneedless to say i think obvious forum troll is obvious as i have said elsewhere    if success is your measure of worthiness to continue    how do you stand on aids research cancerno i do not think that the csm is on par with those    just applying reductio ad absurdum to the argumenti do support the current and past csm members i think they work way wayyy too hard for little thanks or recompensem
i like how people still view it as some sort of holiday while it is actually a whole lot of ing work
thats because it is a holiday a paid one from the company who makes a game that you playand if you really think we are going to believe that sitting around in a room chatting about the game with a few ccp representatives can be considered a lot of expletive work you are going way too far in your estimation of the intelligence in the player base yes the player base is generally stupid but not that dumbthat is of course unless you are stupid enough to actually put work like effort into such an activity that has no meaning other than for a meet and greet
well you see thats the nub of it you all go to iceland get wined and dined you sit around and yak about crap and go home you accomplish nothing more than an inflated sense of selfimportance  and call it fking work lolyou obviously should look up the word work one day
talking about video games is a whole lot of ing work thats for sure notice how desperately sokratez defends the csm process despite it not really having a point and despite how those on the csm that actually care about changing the game for the better were bitterly disappointed by the process thats because hes less about representing the playerbase and making eve better and more about getting an inside track on future changes to the game so he and his alliance can prosper all the csm does is help the large powerblocs become more powerful
two phrases spring to mind only fools and horses worka man who find a job he loves never has to work a day in his lifecsm is very useful to ccp and serves several important functions they will never dissolve it for a start it would make them look bad to their inner circle of players and the gaming media
i think you need trolling help
look how terrible you are

well i do think public perception is one of the tasks and responsibilities of the csmi dont know whats good about being so keen to discredit a member of the csm at the first opportunitythe i tell the full unadorned truth and what will be will be is really only stubborn and simple mindedand thats not me saying they should lieactually thats not what i saidi never said only things that will give someone the boot should be reportedi merely said spoongate was only throwing mud not that mudthrowing is all i wantthis is called denying the antecedent i thinkthe point i was trying to make is theres no need to blame someone at the first opportunityif this is a constant behaviour there will be enough occasions to make it public to back it up with evidence to make it sound justifiedi have no idea why you bring racism and bigotry into thatare you trying to imply that people who do b use a for that so someone using a must be doing bbecause that is called affirming the consequentand i never said the entire group is bad read carefullyi said this will increase the impression of the csm being a waste of timeyou seriously think spoongate will not affect how people think about the csm as a wholelarkonisgate is still one of the things mentioned in articles about the nda breach and hes not in csm any more but they arent 100 peoplehow would you like your argument if we change that number to 2 because thats just as wrong
and im repeating this because you appear to have missed itim not trying to say ankh was right in throwing stuff aroundim trying to say sokratesz wasnt right by using this for his personal agenda against another csm member
yes it is your argument is that people shouldnt tell the truth andor should cover it up if the truth reflect poorly on one csm member yes you did indeed say that anything thats true but that you dont like for whatever reason but that isnt earthshattering is just throwing mud and shouldnt be reported at least maybe until its been repeated a few times why that then is no longer throwing mud is anybodys guess so you didnt google the fallacies ehive mentioned the fallacies of composition and division although you refuse to google them they dont suddenly become noned in this context ah i see youve trained point evasion v whether theyre 2 people or 2000 people judging other people by one persons actions is yep tarded again
hey thats finei have no intentions of continuing this if you just keep riding your i know what you think and do and whatever you write i still know you meant something else
actually as ive quoted and directly responded to your arguments which you then try to alter its much more a case that youre trying to change what youve said after the fact thats okay i suppose but its better to just retract your errors and move on ah well
would it be more visible if i added proposal in the thread title
the absolutely best fights you can have are the ones where you survive with a fraction of structure thats the ones where you have sweaty hands heart racing adrenaline all overand exactly those are the fights that are made impossible by the presence of the npcs even if the damage is only minuscle and it isnt unless you are really moving a lot which you wont be when webbed etc its what breaks the fight no npcs pleasethough its already now annoying how many people plex both offensively and defensively primarily with rokies alts might want a minimum ship restriction for plexes too 
so many bugs for so dam long remain unfixed and forgoten aboutnew bugs every patch adding to the liststop adding stuff and fix what we have ccp ffs get a grip on this
supported though creating new content is paramount for a mmo type game creating new content that is of excellent standards must be whats delivered this game already has so much diverse content that polishing and bringing into excellence the older content would breathe new life into eve and help cement a loyal and growing playerbase

dont normally support or not support posts but this should be the biggest priority since the founding fathers of new eden sat down and made notes on what they wanted eve to be in all its gloryplus 1 emphatically
well as we can read in the meeting minuts from the ccpcsm meet ccp will not commit to excellenceplz all unsubscribe to make clear how you feel about this p
it was mentioned by ccp that the data does not seem to support that polished quality sells better than new featuresand there it is abandon all hope etc etc
ccp fix my game please i mean  even with dominion we had a 1000 man fight in provi in febuary now reinforced nodes are starting to lag out with 600 in them its getting ridiculous something has got to fix this i personally wouldnt oppose a roll back to like apocrypha
management will believe what it wants to believe and they will find data to support their claims works the same everywhere and the only way any of them come around is when they fail and all the pointing fingers and data in the world cant save them from a swift restructuring the csm notes depressed me beyond belief its not that ccp doesnt want to succeed its that they believe their own bs regarding how to get there instead of following the proven successes they achieved as a young company fact is im not sure there is even anyone in a technical position at ccp that could understand how to fix the server issues we currently have the people that did understand this stuff are busy blowing smoke up their own you know whats as managers or have moved on yes while they will keep getting my  for a few more months not like id get a refund i think im just going to have to let the current billing sub run out and find something else to do new shinys are fun and all we all like innovation but they seem to forget that their commitment to excellence should include somewhere a commitment to making the single shard universe actually work if you cant have a fleet fight in eve thats like a burger joint that cant make good burgers

dont forget all the problems with dropdown menusnormally approach is at the top of a drop down menu for an object in space when right clicking one of your drones most commonly done with sentry drones engage target is the last option not a problem if you have nothing targeted but if you have a corpmate targeted you are now shooting that corpmate the dropdown menus should be made consistent so that approach and warp to 0 are always at the topsimilarly when right clicking stations and stargates warp to 0 is replaced by remove stargatestation from overview if you are currently aligningin warp meaning that if your autopilot begins a warp you cancel it and try to warp to the stargate at 0 but click too fast you end up removing stargates from your overview instead of warping perhaps the warpalign options could remain but be grayed outeveryone complains about cancel order and modify order being too close same with sell this item and trash it come on ccp you couldnt see that being a problem

counter proposal1 new characters are created with all the skills in the learning subgroup trained to level iii including the advanced skills2 increase the 100 training bonus cut off to account for the sp added by these gifted skills to level iii3 change the prerequisite for advanced learning skills to level iii of the primary skill instead of iv4 existing characters are given sp pool equal to all the learning skills trained to level 3 no matter if they have the skills trained or not5 reimbursement of isk do not care one way or the other about thisrationaleif the new character experience is the actual catalyst behind this proposal it seems the op is excessive why not a solution that eliminates the obsession with training the skills without unjustly rewarding or punishing existing players for the choices they have made thus far new players would now have less obsession to station spin while skills are trained yet they still have an option which has not diluted the depth of the gameexisting players still benefit from the choices they have made thus far without penalty or undue rewardthis is a solution i could supporti can not support the op it devalues the benefit that players expected and relied upon when they made their original choicesthis taken from my reponse in the other thread on this topic
patri this is an interesting compromise suggestioni would like to see more discussion of this idea in this thread as it may be useful as an alternative to present to ccp it does have the advantage of being easier to implement well probablycan someone please run the numbers on how much training time this would save noobs further how can noobs be encouraged to not continue training the learning skills during the doublerate period
over my dead and stinking carcass i started playing eve 45 years ago and unlike most newcomers to the game i had spent some time researching eves proffessions skills and game mechanics way back then i knew i would like eve and so to get the most benefit out of my 20 a month subscription i trained basic learning to v the prerequisite for adv learning at the time followed by adv learning 4 see these are rl reasons they have nothing to do with eve and everything to do with value for money the higher my stats the quicker i train and improve my return rate so i had to run around in a frig for a while longer than i would have by the time i was ready for a cruiserbcbs i had the peripheral skills required to fly them properly be honest how many of you charged through the ships only to get them torn apart by a hisec belt spawnnow lets move on to the real issue of those opposed to learning how many have been outstripped by younger players who were more diligent in their training by the time i was 3 yrs i had the same sps of people playing since 04 now probably 03 i notice with interest that most want the 50 points in their stats 10 points per att and the 10 but dont want the hassle of traing the skillsthe only way this could be fairly introduced is if they worked out who got what sps from what learning skills and correlate against which version eve the char was born in as the character generation has changed radically since the days we got the average 30 points in atts now i believe it is 43counter proposal remove the learning skills the additional attribute points and the 10 bonus give every char with learning skills the equivelent sps to allocate as they see fit and give the oldest players as many attribute points as it takes to give them parity with newer charsokay then i was being sarcastic now bury this motion before i puke or worse ask for the removal of missile skill and science skill trees
nolearning skills are fine as iswhy is everyone so bent on fixing something that isnt brokenbutpatri you bring up the best counter proposal ive seen so far well thought out
new player experience is one of the primary problems with learning skills but it isnt the sole reason to remove them learning skills are in of themselves just bad game design they do not add depth to the game they dont make sense in terms of realism and they arent fun for anyone but the most deranged minmaxers the only thing learning skills add is a meaningless time sinkno one is punished or rewarded by removing learning skills no ones getting the benefits they gained in the past from learning skills taken away nor is anyone being given the benefits of learning skills previously lost over the yearsmonths by those who didnt train them whats past is past and wont be changedtheres no compromise on the learning skills themselves theyre bad game play and need to removed entirelysomething i think that can be compromised on is what learning skills are replaced with rather than giving everyone the equivalent of maxed learning skills to their attributes i think it would be reasonable to only give players a portion of that say 445 for example and make the difference with new attribute enhancing items such as enhanced implants or learning boosters as i suggested in another thread
ladies and gents i propose to ballance inability of the faction militia corps to create alliances which makes response of virtual alliances mdp cdi to wardecks quite complicated and also increase number of communication channels and organization structureshow it will work1 corporation can create normal alliances while in the militia 2 alliances can join militias3 alliances cannot have sov once in militiawhat it will bring1 simplification of the corporation and wardec mechanics in the militias2 militias will be diferent flag  not the hack style like it is now3 militias will not be overrun by null entitiespowerblocks because they will not sacrifice their precious sov4 reduction of the comm channels5 militia corpsalliances can participate on alliance tournaments without stupid need to create some aritfitial alliances6 more organized fights in fw and more fun in pvpccp please stop treating us as a unwanted child you have with postman we are pretty pvp strong community and have serious impact on lowsec and economy as fw is the biggest shipgrinder in the eve universei would like to ask other militias leaders to drive this topic as a solid discussion and avoid usual warfare and tactics animositiesthnxhidden snakeblog link to this topic
faction alliances will go a long way to making fw a more fun and more interesting place
suppoerted should have already been done when fw was introduced in the first place
its already meant to be this way in the code hence why factions are separate entries in kill mails for example ccp more or less said a few times that this will happenyes please
agreed come on ccp sort it out please

as far as i know the no sovereignty rule was suggested by ccp themselves  so whats the bloody holdupthink it might even work to clean up the horrendous clashes that cause standing drops on rr and what not
tap tap  is this thing on  coughi support this
yes please
fw needs representation in the alliance tournament there is nothing in this proposal that seems outlandish plus it would be nice to be able to send alliance mails to a broader fw group than just your corp but really we need fw veterans in at9 and ccp knows it
good idea
i like totally support this ideaits one of the reasons our corporation left the militia bad coordination with the cdi and stuff i would definitely come back to the militia if this gets introducedcd
once again

i support the idea
mmm i like the idea of industrial corps for example paying for protection but i see one major issue with ittheres no return on investmentsay some mining corp pays for protection all that happens is every wanna be pirating legend for miles is drawn to it like flies industrials pay more more pirates come rapidly any profit margin ie why the industrials are there in the 1st place is eaten away and they just give up  and no industrial corp that hears about it ever tries again
then stay in hisec and let tougher people step up to the challenge people already do it you dont have to pay for the security you have asecurity division within your corpits no good saying lowsec is too dangerous it is supposed to be dangerous i know plent of alliances getting fat and wealthy exploiting hi isk moons ice belts etc in lowsec because while they are industiral based they fly combat well and are prepared to fightthey do ok because they treat lowsec as a danger in itself and tool up appropriately what this thraed is about is making lowsec a better more unique place with more character there is no place for making lowsec safer this isnt a call for more people to go to lowsec it isnt supposed to be crowded like hisec it does however need more content to make it more fun and more immersiveread the original text at no point does it imply that lowsec needs to be high population what it needs is more depth of gameplay it doesnt need t be safe it isnt going to be if you want to live in lowsec you need to be tough simple want that 2 billion isk a month moon take it by force make the system yours and defend it with all your might dominate that system take all the moons have a defence force killing all the rats while your miners strip the belts your security force is ready to deploy or is already roaming your expanding sphere of influence pirates come on by your scouts saw them 4 systems away your miners dock and get into support ships your security division is already at the gate the pirates will need to come through and your ceo is on comms calling in the local bounty hunters the story continues but only if you are man or woman enough

back in the days before yulai there was widespread clamor for highways to connect the capitals of each empire the argument was it takes too long to get anywhere there arent enough players to justify the space approaching stargate etcso ccp added superhighways that connected all four empires with concord space yulai supermarket hub was created market prices across the empires were homogenized the interregional  interempire trader was dead concurrent players peaked around 7000 at this point in timefastforward at some point i do not know when as i was on official leave of absence from the game ccp removed the superhighways and yulai died enter the age of jita amarr rens and dodixiefastforward to present eve reaches 60k concurrent players space is crowded jita is todays yulai prices are once again mostly homogenized not completelyin my opinion it is time to take the final step and remove the highsec highways that connect empires to empires each empire should be bordered with only lowsec systems so that in order to travel between empires you have to travel through borderzones rife with piracy and warfareproposal related to additional currencies removed due to lack of supportthe benefit for one it would allow the possibility of lucrative and specialized trade routes tweak drop rates in different areas and you will have vast price differences with people unable to connect them with autopilot in a freighter think of the trade possibilities that would erupt by simply altering the spawn rate of certain asteroids in the four empirestwo it will spread the population out from the central network that connects the major hubsfinally doing this would at last create the unique flavor of each empirerace it would also create far more opportunity for lowsec gameplay and by that i dont just mean ganking and pirating although certainly there would be that as wellaub
sounds like fun and new profit potential with less risk than selling in lowseci support it with or without exchange rate arbitrage opportunities
coolmake it happen ccpgood idea
i like it it makes sense from an rp point of view and from a gameplay one lets see this one happensigned
with one exception leave the highways as is except you pay m each jump through concord space d
old idea that ive been hoping for years would one day become a reality
qfeid love to go an extra step and only make amarr bpos and skills available in amarr space caldari in caldari space etc this would open up market opportunities by itself

tbh no blasters are fine for me i get in range easy and when im not in range i switch to null sorted
excellent idea to fix hybrids supported
no just no blasters are close range and giving them 100 or even 150 range bonus would make them get the range of pulslasers what they need is a increase in tracking so they even hit circling around a other ship at close range and actually can apply the dps eft says to compensate that blaster boats should get a good increase in speed but not in agility to keep the minmatars hit and run style i agree with rail guns they should be in between beams and artillery and have the largest range of all yes deimos needs a buff in my opinion 5 resist per level to armor
supported if only to  off the trolls who dont want their fotm autocannons and pulses to have a challenge
i just want to point out for the umpteenth time how stupid you are for posting thisif they are a noob they dont know who is better they only read the description and the caldari have the best description
hybrids need an hand ccp for sure will not will not accept the proposal in this or other thread without changes so supporting every hybrid buff thread
this is a good fix for such a weak armament it gets my approval
itt everyone jumps on a bandwagon but are unaware that bandwagon might not even existim talking of course about the core assumption that the op makes  that no ccp devs play eve and thats why there have been the issues that existshort of providing evidence you have no reason to be making such a demand as for all you know they rigorously play itbesides have you ever heard of singularity you know where a ccp team hosts stress tests and actually implements features to let the playerbase itself test them before they come to tq that doesnt strike me as something a company that never bothers testing their own product would do ever watched any of the conferences of fanfest videos or any of that where they exhibit new gameplay through playing the gamesorry but to me that implies that they dont just give it to the code monkeys let said monkeys code it and then bring it to public viewingexhibitiontesting without themselves giving it a shoti actually recall the incarna then ambulation videos where ccp whoever was ing around with wis making jokes about elements of the game that he wouldnt otherwise know of if he didnt play himself and seeming to know what he was doingedit i despise csm memberswannabes who care more about their position in their little treehouse of ascended fandom than anything else wow so what you get to fly to iceland to talk to game devs tell them things that they can find by browsing the forums on their own and have a net effect of absolutely nothing on the final product makes me want to vote for you any of you
this is you not knowing what is going on in the gamethere has been ample evidence around over the past months that shows that devs in fact have no idea about whats currently going on in 00 from weapon cycling issues to the effects of a target painter on a structure to well sov sucking so bad right now nobody wants to do it at allseriously 100 million hit points is dumb nothing in game should require a group of supercaps and 3 hours of time to take down reliably three times and to assume that any portion of your player base would want to do that is beyond basic ignorance it shows a serious disconnect with a group of players you just put out a massive expansion for 6 months agohow about the station services that were added and the things placed outside of towers to promote small gang warfare small gangs of titans have you ever shot some of those things they were moved to give small gangs targets worth hitting in enemy space and yet they gave them 10s of millions of hit points unfortunately they are only hittable by small gangs of carriers dreads motherships and possibly 4050 torp ravens00 is stale right now simply due to 2 factors lag the gms cant recreate on the test server reliably thus having issues they arent even aware are around and a broken sov system that is somehow less fun than pos spam sov warfareim sure that they play or hold accounts and dont play but they obviously arent playing in the areas they had in mind with dominion or theyd know how terrible it is and how terrible just about every change theyve made to 00 over the last 2 years was

lag is the enemy of us allin a fight there will be about 5 times as many drones as ships the server has to track all of their positions and damage and send their positions to every ship in the fight this has to cause lagwhat i propose is that drones should be stacked and appear as a single drone firing as one but still being popped one at a time by targeted weapons and all taking damage from area weaponsso the experience of using drones remains the same  they are almost always used as flights and applied to a single target  the stacking can be done automatically the damage and hitpoints remain the same  shouldnt cause any change in balance or tactics  much like stacking weaponsthe only downside is that drone swarms will be less impressive on screen and easier to target though that is a rarely used tacticthe gain is that by reducing the amount of work the server has to do and the amount of information being reported to every client the lag is significantly reducedal irksome
this is something i have wondered about too but i didnt get a chance to ask about it in iceland and if i had then it would have been a case of i could tell you but then id have to shoot myselfthis particular suggestion is one of a larger class of potential lagmitigation gamedesign changes that really need close consultation between ccp and player experts not just people on the csm as everyone knows were all clueless desperate attention ws in order to determine if the benefits are worth the costs the larger issue of such consultations was raised during the summit check out the minutes due out rsn for the replybtw with clever programming this stacking could be hidden from the player by the client so that the stack would appear in space and overview to be individual drones it is only when a drone is targeted that it needs to be split from the stack and most of the time that does not happenthis would mean that different players would see the drones in slightly different positions but these discrepancies would be lost in the fog of war
seems like an interesting idea perhaps it could work through the current folderbased grouping method for simplicity
this would be interesting to get a response from ccp about
as long as its optional like weapon grouping its ok
agreed there are times i dont want my drones stacking aside from that if it really will reduce lag in a statistically significant fashion then i see no reason not to
i wouldnt mind even if they were obligatorily linked but i already see a problem herewhile with missiles there is no problem because even if they do take damage they are not ever repaired you can and in some situations you want to repair your drones while in space you cant just sum all the shields into a one ubershield armor into uber armor and so on itd become basically a fighter which could be remotely repped in particular think about sentries 5 sentries in a single uber sentry  remote repper from the ship win on the other hand if you do group 5 drones but keep the life separated and just kill the drones 1 at a time you are effectively reducing their survivability since all incoming fire will be focused on just one drone and also you cant recall them one at a time but have to do that all at oncesome of the problems may be seen as downsides of the grouping but beside lag reduction this is tarting to become more a nuisance than a feature
yes i have been thinking about fleet battles where either the intensity of the fight or more likely the drag of the lag rule out micro managing dronesthere would be no advantage to stacking in smaller fights or in pveso it should be optional or at least an option to break the stackits also obvious that lag reduction is a massive technical problem ccp have im sure been actively optimising code and installing faster servers but some computer problems are not easily shared out between parallel processors it is obvious to me that if there are n ships in a fight and each ship has to know the position etc of every other ship then that is n squared notifications that have to go out and notifying drone positions goes up by 5n2 so while ccp can reduce lag in a linear fashion players by piling into battles in bigger and bigger numbers can increase lag in an exponential fashional irksome
ive also thought about that especially making them shoot all at the same time and not just all drones from the same player no all on the whole server should shoot at the same time that would only cause a negligible delay and would help a lot i thinkim not that happy with stacking their positions at least not in a way visible for the player as that would make it harder to click on a particular drone
i vaguely remember someone made a mockup of the drone settings panel including a form voltron checkbox its huh from some thread about the focus fire thing i think sort ofsupported cause its cool

disclaimer i dont know the ingame history or forum history of anyone participating in this thread and i am explicitly refraining from praising or criticizing playersit seems that the key point from the detractors thats being missed in this discussion is the following its undesirable to make one thing overpowered as a sideeffect of making something else properly balanced those who are basing their arguments on this point are claiming the following right now shield logistics ships are properly balanced but shieldbased spidertanking battleship gangs are underpowered if the shield transfer modules are buffed without any other changes then shield logistics ships would become overpowered while shieldbased spidertanking battleship gangs would become properly balanced which is a situation to be avoided however if ccps buff the shieldbased battleships themselves rather than buff the shield transporter modules then we will have a situation where both the shield logistics and the shieldbased spidertanking battleships are properly balanced and this is a much more desirable situation than having either being underpowered or overpoweredthe above is the argument i think the detractors of the original poster are trying to make for the above to make sense you must hold the following premises to be true1 shield logistics ships are properly balanced at present2 if the shield logistics ships are buffed in any way whether by buffs to the ships themselves or by buffs to the modules they use then shield logistics ships will become overpowered3 shieldbased spidertanking battleship gangs are underpowered at present4 buffing the shield transporter modules will buff both the shield logistics ships and the shieldbased spidertanking battleship gangs5 buffing the shieldbased battleships themselves will buff their spidertanking gangs but will not buff the shield logistics shipsi dont know if such arguments are right or wrong i dont know if those premises are true or false maybe the best approach is to just buff the shield transfer modules as the original poster suggests maybe the best approach is to buff the shieldbased battleships as the detractors suggest maybe the best approach is a combined tweaking of the modules logistics ships and battleships i dont know enough of the issues myself to advocate one approach over another i post only for the sake of clear and constructive discussion
the proposed buff would not in any way affect shield logistics ships try againif for some reason you really would want to fix the not in any way boosted logistics ships you could nerf their cpu with the same amount that would be freed by the lower cpu cost of shield transportersright now on a scimi i can fit if i want 4 large shield transporters  xl shield booster if for some weird reason i want that now what happens if you lower cpu cost of shield transporters nothing obviously it can still fit everything but now with some spare cpu but since it didnt lack cpu in the first place it wouldnt be boosted in any waybuffing shield based battleships is a terrible idea then we just get a bunch of overpowered battleships running around the problem are shield transporters not shield based battleships not to mention all the traditionally armor tanked bs would then be fail in shield based gangs
lrarpros 10 more cap efficientcons delivers reps at the end of the cyclelstpros reps at the start of the cyclecons has an insane cpu cost that makes fitting them impossible without gimped fittings with the exclusion of dedicated logistics ships shield tanks also use mid slots which prevents usage of ewarseboseccmwutdecrease lst cpu bump up cap use slightly
youve stated logistics cruisers and slot layouts the logistics cruisers argument is irrelevant because amazingly were not talking about logistics cruisers and i dont understand why you cant grasp this the only relevance of the slot layout issue is that it makes a rr shield gang weaker than a rr armour gang hey actually this is an argument for making lsts much easier to fit lrars
makes perfect sense lets make it fair
well no its an argument for the fact that the slot layout is the problem not the fitting stats if the mods cost 1 cpu and 1 grid you would still not see rrbs shield gangs because they do not have the slot layout for it
are you seriously trying to tell us that a lst taking 22 of a ships cpu while a lrar can take less than 6 of pg or cpu is a greater problem than the fewer medslots available for shieldtanking bsthe raven rokh scorpion tempest maelstrom domi and hyperion could all pull off satisfactory rr shield tanks if lst cpu use was sensible this is more than half the t1 bs in the game the medslots argument is nonsense and im having difficulty taking you seriously sure the bs with 4 or fewer medslots do have medslot issues  armageddon abaddon apocalypse megathron typhoon and in return many bs cant get a decent armour tank with damage mods on as ever with shield vs armour you trade dps for ehpin any case even if the medslot argument was convincing it wouldnt be an argument for not balancing the fitting requirements of lrars and lsts it would have no bearing for example on a proposal to balance the fitting requirements of lrars and lsts by increasing lrar pg use by 400
it might be satisfactorily but it would still not be good enough to compete with rr armour fittings which usually have 23 slots available next to the mandatory mwd and injector as i said waay back in this threads 7 or 8 mids are really whats needed to competemwdinjectorlselseinvulinvul point web scram eccm sensorbooster second injectortake your pick in terms of lowslots all that an rr shield bs really needs is a damage control and damage mods so 4 lowslots should really be enoughand i am being very serious actually i do not believe that the fitting requirements are a major cause for the lack of rr shield gangs thinking of it one of the additional reasons in the past might have been the fact that it was easier to tank a dd with an armour fit but that has been invalid for awhile now as usual it does take some time for the public perception to adjust though but the potential of rr shield would still be held back by a lack of suitable ships
thank you sorkatez you have just proved my point you listed six modules there and guess what most shield tanking battleships do have 67 mid slots in addition to that on some minnie and caldary ships cap injector is not even necessary because nothing consumes cap neither the weapons nor the tank as for utility slots these ships have up to four lowslots free for damage mods sensor amplifiers and some other modules that make them excellent fleet ship if you are trying to tell my that you cannot create a decent shieldbuffertancking battleship you are horribly wrong i personally know about ten people that fly those ships regularly and they do so fairly well i do not see any problem that would make shieldtancking ships inferior apart from stupid cpu requirement on the remoterepp module if you do make a proposal to boost the lowslot utility modules such as sensor backup array slightly if you really feel sorry for these guys either way i still dont see how is inferiority of shield tanking battleships which is what you are showing here i believe a reason to making them suffer yet more by making this module unfittable either there is a logic breakdown or you are trolling in which case i would like you to stop
sokif the armageddon is a satisfactory rr bs which it is then three medslots are sufficient  mwd injector and something else being a point or eccm sensor booster whatever a fourth and certainly a fifth can be regarded as nice but not essentialafter the mandatory mwd and injector a fivemedslot bs has room for dual inv and a lse an example is tempest giving with dc and triple cdfe 87k ehp 104k ehp overheated in squad and a 291 dps tank from a lst ii excluding peak passive recharge sure this isnt great  a comparable armour tempest having dc trimarks triple eanm single 1600 and a single gyro would have 106k ehp 115k ehp in gang and a 296 dps tank from a single lrar iihowever the shield tempests lowslots are freed up for triple gyro and dual te  you appear to have forgotten about tes in your last post  and even when only considering falloff and not tracking this makes a hell of a difference at a typical combat range of 20 kmarmour tempest 1x gyro barrage dps 488 optimalfalloff 636 km dps at 20 km  90 of max  439 dps its 428 dps with rf fusionshield tempest 3x gyro barrage dps 656 optimalfalloff 7859 km dps at 20 km  97 of max  636 dps 45 more dps than the armour tempestshield tempest 3x gyro rf fusion dps 823 optimalfalloff 3939 km dps at 20 km  89 of max  732 dps 67 more dps than the armour tempestso a shield tempest would lose 18 ehp have about the same rr efficiency but deal 67 more dps with better tracking if the fight is at 1 km then the triplegyro shield fit still deals 34 more damage on a strict consideration of ehpdps the shield fit is greatly superior demonstrating that the tempest has enough medslots to cope we can do the same for the hyperion in either 350 mm rail or blaster fit an armour hype with triple eanm 1600 dc and trimarks has 122k ehp and with 7x 350mm rails one free for rr does 428 dps at 20 km ignoring tracking a shield 7x 350mm hype with lse dual inv dc triple cdfe has 103k ehp 113k overloaded 16 less than the armour hype and with the same efficiency of received rr but with the triple magstab of the shield fit it does 34 more dps switching to neutrons and null gives 554 dps at 1116 km meaning 80 damage at 20 km 443 dps but with the triple magstab and dual te that a shield fit allows neutron null gives 1526 km optimalfalloff and 745 raw dps dealing 97 damage at 20 km 723 dps  31 more than the armour null fit and again for the loss of only 16 of the armour hypes ehpyes these fivemedslot fits dont have room for tackle the sixmedslot ships would have to do this and eccm etc would be a problem and those nasty lasers will hurt the shields but on a straight ehpdps product comparison these numbers demonstrate that the fivemedslot gunships are considerably more effective when shieldrrtanked the slot layout is not a significant issue
ok lets try to bring the points together and think about this people1 armor remote reps are fine as is done2 shield remote reps are too fitting intensive for bs gangs ok lets see3 shield remote reps are balanced on logistic cruisers ahso the point that is trying to be made with all of the logistics cruisers are balanced posts is not really about logistics cruisers it is about the followingchanging the module itself will then make these balanced ships imbalancedas such it has been suggested that the battleships themselves need to be reworked perhaps a bit more cpu perhaps more mids to allow for more modules related to propewaror we could always reduce the amount of cpu required to fit the module and reduce the total cpu of the logistics cruisers thereby making it impossible to fit more remote shield reps than intended on these shipseither way would work however i fail to see why you should fix the balanced part while leaving the broken part unchanged changing the stats on the battleships themselves does seem to be working more towards the actual problemnow everyone take a deep breathflame on
why dont you just change the module fitting requirements and then adjust the fitting bonus on the logi ships to reflect that change then you only have to change 3 items instead of 7 and it doesnt unbalance the logistics ships
i am very sorry for overestimating the average iq of a forum reader i thought that it would have been obvious that we would decreace cpu of the logis ships to keep them exactly as they are without any changes to htme and only improve the battlehips i will add this to the original postthank you alot that is exactly what i meant to do somebody is intelligent around here
please visit your user settings to reenable images
lrst heavy cpu fitting needsreps hit at start of cyclelratheavy pg needsreps hit at end of cyclethats balanced if you cant see it theres more wrong here than your argument your whining about the cpu needs difference while ignoring the massive difference in power grids that the two mods haveyour also over looking something very obvious in your arguemntrr armor gangs are not more common due to the actual rr mod itselftheres a spoiler past this line it may ruin the game for youall ewar and shield mods occupy the same slotsthats it sherlockshield rr gangs dont happen because in many cases it will totally nullify the ability to bring tackle jamming damps sensor boosters or any of the other useful mods couple that with the fact that shield tanking ships are also notoriously light on low slots so the few mods that can be fit to the low slots compete with vital damage modsif you want to see more shield rr gangs you need ccp to wake up and remodel most shield tankers low slots and create a few low slot mods that act like the mid slot mods that the armor tankers use like points webs jammers damps target painters cap boosters ectalso a broader view of overall game mechanics wouldnt hurt you either
you assume that everyone trains 55 learnings right at the start which is not the casefor example  i just trained one advanced learning to 5 on a char who has over 60 mil sp it still will take way more than a year to pay back why i should not be getting it back 
not supported leave this issue alone there is nothing worng with learning imho

the exact contents of an nda are usually covered by itwell yes and noas someone who both has to sign maybe an nda every other month and have others sign our ndas about every week there is usually a few semispecific clauses in an nda or at least articles which appear to be specific but usually often are not if you read them correctly  ie from the point of view of the coy making you sign it and a number of clauses which can if they realy want be interpreted very loosley indeedthere are of course very specific single item type ndas but since it has already been stated that the other csms who had to sign the same document dont know why she was dismissed we can very safely take it  that the document did not explicitly state 1 single item or even a short bit specific list
its quite common to sign a nda on the actual nda before signing itabout the only simple nda i signed is the steamworks nda
i spy a leak in ccps boat is anyone else grabbing their life jackets
no we are all sipping pina coladas in the lobby
man this guy is so stupid you could perform a lobotomy on a monkey and the monkey would still come out smarter i feel sorry for the people who voted for him specially when you take obi wans wisdom in to considerationwhos the greater fool the fool himself or the fool who follows him
no and you appear to have contracted a dangerously contagious case of the wrongsnda breach  so serious they ccp cantwont talk about it and neither canwill eva jobse it seemsyeah how dare that guy have the gall to respond to people at their own level while simultaneously not taking their petty talking of which here you go i found these for you  now you wont have to ask your mom to help you before you can run to the computer and post your latest treatise
luckily european legal system is different from the american legal system i cant think of any court in europe that would rule much more than 100k dollarseuros in damages in a case like this
well you know you dont actually have to respond every time some one says something you find offensivewow those shoes are awesome i always wanted shoes like that cheers m8
u mad that you got called out for targetting the person consistently trying to  usually politely  correct the wildly misinformed and the deliberately misinforming edit i wouldnt say sokratesz finds them offensive maybe he finds the stupidity they portray offensive but youre speculating either way
i like your styleits funny though because it generates drama
mad no bored yes bored because you cant come up with some interesting replies but you seem quite agitated there are measures you can take you know for starters breathe out slowly when people are feeling angry they most often take in more breath than they breathe out breathing out properly helpsnow firstly i never said that you said that sokratesz found the comments offensive i just deducted that from his tone and the very fact that he bothered replying at allsecondly this is the internet and nobody cares what you wouldcoulddidwill sayyou know just when i thought you had shown me what maximum stupidity was you just keep on amazing me keep it up i just put on the popcorn
and then the thread boiled down to who has the biggest trollpeen
when i started work for google i had to sign a nda for the nda stating that within 1 year of termination or resignation i am not allowed to discuss the nature of the nda well the year is up if the nda is anything like googles i can say this if eva blogged or mentioned to people anything that was covered by said nda wether it be pink pigs with blue snouts were coming for winter expansion and she told people that would be a breach of said contract but also ndas are a two way street to protect the employee aswell as they cannot mention anything further until it is with out 100 proof kinda like innocent before proven guilty also if sensitive information like business practices were being spoken of like how they spent money to outside firms they are well with in rights to do so also in the nda if specific information is not conveyed across accurately then it is grounds for termination such as employment at specific companies like saying you work for ccp games and or work for outside development houses huge liability risks and would be terminated it would be like working for google and yahoo at the same time
i really was never banned dont know why i would be banned

well if you think about itits not really a passive income because the game is constantly changing and influenced by its players as we see in csm also by introducing a stock exchange to the economy it gives the whole stock part of every corporation some meaning rather then just the ability to create votes submit votes or recieve dividends if you look at it from a business point of view every corporation in the game is a privately held company or closed corporation being that there is no stock market of any kind to sell or trade stock its a good idea and i dont think it would have much of a simulator feel to it if the actions of players doing missions destroying npc corp convoys or npc corp ships of any kind also if you add in npc stock value increaseing and decreasing based on npc sales to playerson another note eve is not primarily a spaceship based pvp game if it was there would be alot less npc interaction meaning you wouldnt have concord or any story arc style missions there wouldnt be much in the aspec of npcs except for the market place to sell items and it wouldnt have such an indepth manufacturing or mining tree a good example of a game that is primarly pvp is counterstrike you can add bots which would be your pve but its mainly a pvp game there is forced pvp in eve but you dont have to pvp to play eve lol this would give the carebears something to do when they are getting station camped
the guys in a hulk hes gonna get smoked anyways xd
pray tell which other ewar can be countered by implants at allthe lowgrade sets are less than 100mill fyi they are infact damn cheap for the effect they give ofc you never used them so you wont knowand as a matter of fact its perfect they block those implant slots god forbid youd have to decide between sensor strength and slave set in a bs blobive yet to see a nonfailfit curse that doesnt have neuts and tracking disruptordepending on the role you fill minmatar recons have their target painters and webs at the same time and gallente ones do have points and damps at the same timereally you have it completely backwards caldari recons need two bonuses to make one type of ewar module viable the other races only need one
target painters can be countered by halos and xinstinct i suppose which other ewar cannot be countered by appropriate piloting
ill give you the target painter despite the fact that these counters arent used as counters but rather needed for the setup in the first place but meh semanticsas far as appropriate piloting goes try to counter neuting by piloting or webbing and scramming you could argue about rsds and tds but at the end of the day you are not countering anything you are just reacting in the expected manner
tbh i think theres got to be a better way to rebalance ecm than this
do you honestly think that people would give up the 50 ehp that trimarks give when taking their bs blobs out for a spin as for it being unbalanced why then do we have ewar boosting rigs shouldnt a counter exist in the same formproblem with ecm vs solosmall gang is mainly the severe lack of slots there are simply not enough to prevent being jammed boosters would solve it but are illegal in highsec empire and are a lot harder to come by compared to rigs  so you end up with a solution for the elite  not a route i want to gosupportlets see we have recharge capshield implants tracking implants lock speed implants lock range implants etc etc etc pretty much all of thembenefit of those are that they give an edge without costing you a fortune and blocking all your slots sets may give bigger bonus but are cost prohibitive in the extreme as soon as engagement leaves empire or exceeds 70 when bubbles and lag reduce pod survival rates to silly low levelslowgrade wouldnt be caught dead with the useless things  vast majority of ships even frigates are better off using highgrades as their base sensors are 10 and you wont have to swap clone when choosing larger hulls so you are correct i never used them just as i generally steer clear of other useless features in this game  hg however is a different storydo you really think that there are a lot of slave or any set for that matter users in bs blobs considering that those blobs are most common in bubble land i question that assumption  supercapital blobs on the other hand
it would require a huge overhaul ecm behaves in a manner completely different to all other forms of ewar if it was brought more in line with them then it would be alot more funas for everyone saying youve got to counter it just like any other ewar all the other counter modules are useful beyond merely countering their ewar for example sensor boosters give target range and target speed cap boosters have their obvious benefit as well eccm does absolutely nothing on the field except help you avoid getting ecmd
good idea itd generally be nice to see a boost to boosters
you might wanna recheck before making phantastic claims hgs are worse than lgs in pretty much all frigate hulls and hgs only really start making sense in bs hullswhile hg indeed gives you some extra strength against lg on bc hulls and hacs the extra cost is in absolutely no relation to the pretty much nonexistant extra benefitwhats more given they are so dirt cheap you can have them in your nullsec clone if you arent a total cheapskatedo you really think bubbles are working everywhere last time i checked the majority of pvp happens outside of bubble landas far as blobs go the bigger your blob the less trouble hostile ecm is its not rocket science
taking into account both sides of the argument both sides have very valid points of view on the whole though i support this action obviously there would be kinks to work out but the ops suggestion holds merit and should be looked atsupported
not supportedhaving problems with ecm put on eccm or put on a sebo for when the ecm ship loses a jam dont whine about failing to counter a ship that has no tank and very little firepower  that is all
thumbs downanother person trying to buy themselves into the ultimate solo i win buttonspecialized ecm ships with weaknesses across the board everywhere else in its weight class is something youre just gonna have to deal with
if you ever suspect a dangerous desync close the client immediately your ship may be saved by ewarp  logoffski vanishing actremember that next timescreenshots cant be taken as evidence as it is relatively easy to fake them with photoshop if you know how to work the tools for all they know you made that image yourself when you got ed after dying in hilarious fashion to mission rats in a high end ship
yes screenshots can be forgedyou dont have access to servers and any screen shot on your end can be accused as forgeries so in practice you can prove nothing for any claim access to logs and therefore burden of proof has always been on ccp because theyre the only ones with access to any evidence that theyre willing to be accept if the logs are known to be false it simply means ccp does not have the evidence to disprove your claim they should give you back the loki instead of demanding you to do something impossible
i would like to change this issue if op agrees from give me back my loki to bring this type of issues to attention of ccp so their petition answering department forgot its name actually reimburces ship loss if a screenshot without any trace of forgery andor logs contradicting it is presented change it to when in doubt reimburse
basically an anchorable satellite which acts as your forward scout they are however only anchorable at gates and they are fairly expensivethis would free up the forward scouts from boring scouting getting them into a fighting role and can improve the defences position
though i hate to disagree with someone who uses a carl sagan quote in their bioso youd rather put low sp characters into combat ships than scout frigates as it stands scouting and tackling is about all low sp characters can do in combat  why take that away from them

you seem to be acting under the assumption that eve is designed to ensure the safety of your ship this is not true if you cant afford to lose it you shouldnt be undocking in it because random people killing you is an intentional game mechanic it is quite literally why eve was created if you dont like it stop undocking in valuable ships
itt nonenglish player believes that by posting his complaints about a game mechanic working exactly as designed in his native language on the expressly english eve online forum he will garner sympathy and have his shipt magically returned to himby the way what was it exactly i kind of hope it was a faction ship for no particular reason whatsoeveredit hey read the translated jibberjabber turns out it was hulksoh well someone missed the note about hulkageddon i suppose
possibly undocking hulks like a lemming one can always hope
he apparently lost his hulk in highsec then proceeded to put all his belongings into a t1 hauler to get suicided again so hes quitting apparentlyhence why im still very interested in his stuff  should there be any stuff left that isi wont go through the hassle of translating that garbage though
translated and fixed a bit since batolemaeus is a lazybutt pi decided to translate in the hopes itll amuse those who saw this thread and raised their eyebrows at that illegible blurt of german gibberish
ur stuffz can i has
just like with any other mmo nothing is irreplaceable in eve i lost my proteus recently because i was on the phone im not crying about it although this again raises the concern that suicide ganking in highsec is too easy isnt there suppose to be a massive sec status hit for podkilling
who cares its lots of fun i can imagine its even more fun in high sec where the pod is likely to contain expensive implants
ding ding ding we have a winner and as long as im using destroyerscruisers then my 10 sec status doesnt mean jack when im just warping in to lose my ship anyway the only fear we have because we use empty clones you should try it when everyone is gunning for you is that our pods will be flooded with your tears  luckily weve built machines that allow us to turn those same tears into pure sustenance cry more im hungry
this reminds me of
umccpplayersi have been wondering for a long time on whats the point of scope news articles i mean u dont interact with most of these characters in game and the issues they have with one another affect nothing in game and dont affect playercorporations so whats the point where does the ammar queen live i want to tickle herexamplethis recent articleamarr prime  the first of yonis ardishapurs speaking engagements was held today in damtorsad on amarr prime speaking before a crowd of just under a thousand for little over an hour the heir has focused mainly on his views on religion the empire and the roles of all peoples in its futureardishapur called on all those attending the event to remember where you came from be you a freed slave a descendant of slaves a merchant a navy officer a holder or even royalty it is paramount to remember the roots of the faith all men are created to serve god and do his will it is not merely time served that shall be rewarded but the conviction and faith with which you serveadditionally ardishapur made clear his views on the other races of the cluster all people must one day be brought into gods embrace through their own choice or through our guiding hand embrace those who would learn defeat those who would make mockery of gods way through the penance of deeds the sins of forefathers may eventually be washed away this is the amarr way and it is the future if the empire is to thrivethe heir closed his speech thanking those for attending and promising that he would never forget the sacrifices made by the true faithful in times of falsehoodthere is not even an author
wrong forum sectionbut to answer your question anyway there is a strong rp community in this game and an unfolding storyline connected with the real live events in the game like introduction of factional warfare or wormholes or more recently sansha invasion those events are relevant to all empires and the storyline thats why scope news articles are published if they are not relating directly to something that is happening then they are just adding depth to the story
moved from assembly hall to general discussion
its just backstory you are free to ignore this stuff but it is intended to add to the feeling and depth of the eve universe as well as add colour and flavour i personally like reading them just like i enjoy reading the chronicles etc and like it when they report on player events that i havent heard about
try this onenews article have been talking about sanshas attackscapsuleers have been able to participate in this attacks both for and against sansha because theyve been live eventsone recent news article talked about a scheduled concert to take place in sarum primeeve players conclude that this event would be a perfect target for some future attackdo the news articles have any effect yes not only do they contribute to eve lore but they also provide framework for in game events they also provide fuel to the rping community
try checking not scope but interstellar correspondents those guys give real news and quite nice read usually
rp also provides nice opportunites for massive tears when suicide ganked d
i would like to know the official ccp position on this is there an actual reason for it it is nearly a month since the tournament finished yet no prizes have been handed out i have received 2 mails from ccp claw around a week apart each asking essentially the same thing where to put the medals and who to send the isk to i have replied to each very promptlyi would like to know if the more highup staff in ccp know how incompetently the handing out of the prizes are being handled or if they even careis the tournament just a pr stunt that they no longer care about when its finished  or do they genuinely care and this is just the result of one terribly inefficient and incapable employeeseldarine
i had heard it took a few months for everything to be sorted out last year as well
all joking aside i agree with this 100 im sure all the other prize winners feel the same way
i think claw is enjoying that he can troll you without even writing something
then submit a petition contact customer support and act according to your corp name
hi allever since ccp set up singularity last year and gave all players at the time level v in every skill ive been thinking it would be nice if it was a regular thingthe whole idea of the weekend back then was for players to help ccp test out supercapitals not sure about what the rest of you did if you went on there but i bought viators cranes a sin and just generally had a bit of a play around with some t2 ships i was nowhere near being able to fly at the time on tranquility and pretty much goofed around looking back on it i should have used some of the carriers dreads and titans ccp gave everyone and got a feel for the ships and their various rolesi thought that perhaps ccp could organise more allskillsatlevelv weekends on singularity for newer players to do the same sort of thingsay a new player joins eve and hears all about tech 2tech 3 ships dreadnoughts carriers titans amd think to themselves damn id love to be able to fly one of those one daybut which onethe 6 months plus it takes to be able to fly a ship let alone fly it well and have support skills to be able to use it effectively is a major putoff for some and it is a lot of time to devote to whatever it is they decide to train foran allskillsatlevelv weekend would let the player get into these ships see what they are capable of what the limitations etc are and let them decide if its something they really want to go for in the end spending all that time training for a t2 ship or carrier or the like the player would want to be sure its something worth spending all the time training forhaving other pilots tell them yeah man that carrierassault cruiserinterdictorinterceptortitan is awesome sometimes just might not be good enough whats awesome and cool for another player might not be for anotherletting a player go onto the test server once in a while say once every 6 months perhaps would give the player the chance to get into that nice flashy ohsolongtotrainfor ship class and see for themselves which race suits themjust a thought
sisi has been running for years and no people shouldnt be given all level 5swhydo you know how to fly a capital shipwhat makes the average jo 3 month old the right person to test capitalsits like getting a 10 year old to test a harrier jump jet its stupid pointless and dangerouswhat they need to do is have mail shot groups that go out to specific pilots for when they want to test specific thingsexampleblack ops testingall black op pilots players with the relivant skill get a message asking if theyd like to help with testing in exchange for free stuffsame goes for any other item that needs testingthat way you get pilots that at least know how to fitfly a capital ship on the most part
this forum needs a thumbs down optionid like to use sisi for testing having any chance of reproducing something ruined by a bunch of adhd kids with all lvl5 skills would be detrimental to sisi as a test server
agreed not to mention i like to test with skill approximating what i actually have not some pointless fantasyits all moot in any case its a test server not a fluffy bunny happy heaven server ccp is always going to set it up so that it suits their needs not the wants some delusional player
hi everyone i was wondering how others feel about the in space interface for me it feels a bit flat and boring and not at all worthy of the otherwise awesome atmosphere the game has i would love to see something a bit more immersive and dimensional i saw this  da a few days ago and i thought how great it would be if we saw something similar in eve im not saying that we should get rid of the current controls but instead build up on them  have something as a second option that would bring the game one step closer to the real deal nothing grand and spectacular like an individual interior for each ship or race just a standard model that would add that special feel to the game that i currently think it lacks lets try to make eve a bit more personal and move it away from the cold and lifeless rts view that it is currently stuck in and bring it to a whole new level sorry if this topic has already been discussed feel free to delete this post if it hasjmedit in regards of the controls i say keep the current pointandclick system for fine tuning and add something like a 3d compass wheel that can do 90deg leftrightupdown turns with a single click for the more complex adjustments in your course
i think some of the frustrations at and in the csm is because there are many good issues raised without sufficient focus on costs so while there is shortterm and longterm value in the csm passing a couple of hundred good ideas i think it would also be useful to have some way to rank value people are used to the 100point ship budget for the alliance tournament what if your ccp contact came back with a point value for the cost of each proposals and asked the csm what 100points would they want one problem now is that the more efficient and motivated the csm or player base the more they propose but what ccp can do each 6months is finite and currently below average with incarnadust integrationlag so it looks like ccp is less responsive when in fact a csm is just more creative i am worried when i read in past minutes phrases from ccp about a feature not worth doing very successful software companies may always know what the costs are but sometimes get a bit out of touch with what the customer especially less experienced customer really wants is there a mechanism to allow the csm to provide insight to ccp in making costbenefit decisions
this is one thing that stakeholder status is about and we intend to provide prioritization feedback as part of our role the problem is that csm has no guarantee of developer time so we dont know how many points are available to allocate further whereas other competitors for developer time are interacting in realtime and realspace csm has significant ping time and bandwidth disadvantages we are effectively playing the game of fix eve over a 110baud modem relayed through a proxy server hosted on the cassini space probei think you will find the upcoming summit minutes will shed some more light on this issue
currentlya click on a columns header sorts the table by the column and highlights the columnanother click on the header reverses sorting orderthere is no way to remove highlighting and reset sorting order to the default i propose this trivial changethird click on the same header removes highlighting and resets sorting order to the defaultwhat do you think
this
as the title says titans can only lock capital ships
well thought out proposal i especially like the detailed procon analysis and arguments as to how this proposal will improve the gamewait wrong topicnot supported no reasoning given for the change no explanations no nothing this isnt a proposal its barely even a statement
they can that sounds like a pretty nasty bug you should report it here after all how ridiculous would it be if a titan couldnt attack the ships tackling them in order to make good their escape
the one thing that really bothers me about eve is the capsupercap proliferation the closer i am to buying and sitting in a supercap the more i think that they are just outright bad for the game i realize that i am having trouble seeing through the lens of small gang pvp  but i think its a much more viable lens considering that large gang pvp literally breaks the serverlianged and as much as i dislike supercaps i dont support this p
i have some concerns about how supercapital warfare is affecting eve but that is completely unrelated to this proposal i mean seriously what is a titan ever targeting other than a capital or the odd hictor you could give hictors doomsday immunity and have exactly the same effect on serious gameplay itd just deprive us of comedy doomsdays
not supportedpi has a plenty high iskhour return even in highsec the problem is that pi is incredibly clickintensive and requires no higher thought processes after your facility is configuredthat is what needs to change make pi less clickintensive and somehow require tactical decisions to be made during the reset process
ccp is still conducting their investigation if pl cheated using that sphere program to hack the clientnot supported
you would think someone who actually works for a gaming company would have a bit more understanding of ndassure there are allot of issues to fix with eve but i think we should be thankful we have any say at all ive been playing eve for several years now and following it from the beginning ccp has made mistakes but no more than any other gaming company i for one would much rather give my money to a company that actually cares about their game as opposed to a company say like blizzard who just fires their devs when they disagree with their ideas a company produces fast food games for the masses without ever stopping to think about what their players want to be honest she should be booted simply for her opinions of other players play styles none of the other csm delegates seem to be insulting other players play styles and calling for their removal from the game or worse calling them outright psychopaths finally and most important this person is supposed to be representing us in a professional and courteous manner not throwing objects at other players and yelling at developers this kinds of childish behavior has no place in the csm and clearly demonstrates her lack of qualificationsbreaching the nda is really just the straw that broke the camels back i say good riddance 
i cannot understand how people think breaching a nda isnt a good reason to kick someone off if they cant trust her to keep things secret how can they tell her more about the future of the game will she be excluded from the conference room while everyone else gets to listen in
most people like myself are just curious why a democraticly elected member of the csm was removed so completely out of the blue since the electors at least parts thereoff wanted her to be in that position an ndaviolation on the other hand is a rather vague concept that basically covers everything between stealing and selling data from a ccpdevputer over making screenshots of the newest remodelled ships down to accidently stepping on a postit that lay on the floor and ended up sticking on her shoe with the note must get new coffeemug11eleven  ccp hilmarend of the line is people want to get some more specific info on the breach rather then a because we say so be it out of curiousity actually valid interest or finding another reason to gloat about the hated enemy
i agree that its not very satisfying but its everything they technically have to tell us everything beyond that is goodwill from their side and ccp doesnt exactly have a good rep on that account
im not going to dispute the validality of ccps decision because quite honestly the current situation hints at an actual and severe breach and as such i accept the decision however it doesnt mean i and everyone else needs to be satisfied with the as is especially since reality tought us all one thing never trust any authority further then you can throw them 
hmmmmaybe it wasnt colonel mustard in the study with the revolver replace colonel mustard with eva jobse study with studio and revolver with a hilariously large  stuffed sack with proprietary secrets stenciled on it but ccp is actually trolling us with help from ankhesencopypasta while ccp busily reduce the overabundance of clicking necessary in planetary interaction  without having to feel obligated to answer any questions meanwhilewell at least i can hope
a breach of a nda can get you 3 months to 5 years jail time in germany if the breach is severe enough this does not include the damages caused by the breach for the nda issuera indiscretion is one thing industrial espionage something of an entirely different magnitude all covered by a nda as long as we dont know how big the breach was we cant really argue if the removal was appropriate or not
maybe theyll have the icelandic mafia work her overmaybe they already have but it went too farmaybe any day now someone will open a can of fermented shark and find  biomass they werent expecting to findmaybe this will serve as a warning to others
how does it hint a a serious breach if we know jack  about what happened or did i miss something
the fact we know jack  is because nobody has told us nobody has told us because the breach is serious
by counting one and one togetherdo you really think out of all the people in the game that exactly ankh would stay as quite as she does if she didnt do something that is obviously wrong regardless if she realized the breach at first or not not even her blog yields any news at all and thats quite telling unless she got abducted tied up gagged and sits in ccp hilmars cellarbeyond that her occupational survival basically depends on if she did break the nda or not and while i think a lot of nasty things about ccp in general i do not count legalsuicide to their featlist
the threat of legal action would cause anyone to be careful on what they say lets say i broke a nda by accidently posting a screenshot of some new thingy in a game on my blog stuff like that happens all the time but can hardly be called serious or damaging and lets asume i get sacked for it ppl often get sacked for minor stuff just because its company policy or cuz management are arses so you got sacked for a minor incident would you then go shouting what happened to you knowing that the company could still start a law suit against you or would you be smart and just let it go since you know you will never beat the company in courti would do the latter and i think 99 of all ppl wouldeva herself stated she did not agree with the fact that there even was a breaching of nda that is not the kind of statement you would make if you stole the complete list of features in the next expansion and sold it to a competitorso i would say that when you put one and one together it actually points to a minor breach rather than anything serious
sounds reasonableit could of course be linked to some of the old fw issues ankh learnt about some of the exploits not classed by ccp as exploits and screamed from the roof tops about them ccp did nothingso she made the nonexploits widely known and encouraged everyone to abuse them to hell and back in the hope ccp would do somethingso this could all be down to petty vengeance for making them do some work speculation speculation
could be but like you said its all speculation and i doubt well ever hear more about it p
well first theres a bit of a difference between someone in a beta posting a screen shot of a game before it releases and real and serious breaches of nda what game development company is going to hire a game designer that broke an nda for another game company what company as a rule will someone thats well known for breaking an nda right now ccp is all but terminated her career in the game industry  and if they did this maliciously or for teh lulz or for player politics or because she blogged things that everyone else blogged or whatever the hell tinfoil hat reason youre coming up with theyre going on the hook for some pretty tremendous legal fees and damagesno what we can say is that eva jobse a very noisy individual and ccp are both sitting tight and shutting the  up this is a strong hint that they both have legal advice and reason to do so she may have posted i dont agree but i think that hardly matters considering her resounding silence sinceliang
fwiw i agree with liangs analysis but not the strength of his convictionsput a gun to my head and say whos right ccp or eva i choose ccpbut im not totally sold since she has denied it and we know little other than accusation vs denial only time will tell hopefully if there is a defense people wont be so jaded based on prejudices speculation and internethypemongering that they will be able to consider the facts with an open mind
things wouldnt be so speculatory if eva had not fallen off the face of the universeis anyone willing to place a bet that ankh got hit by a bus or something after the nda breachjust kidding i doubt that happened but whats actually happened to her since her removal is of much interest and mystery
most likely answer like lark her main and her alts were all banned this is why we havent seen some of the obvious alts who were posting constantly during anks campaign also ank realizes that right now that eva jobse may soon be a google search that yields up the massively article or similar ones about the alleged nda violation as one of the very first answers and shes determined to save her career prospects by suing ccp if thats the case shed have to be crazyer to blab on the net rather than keeping it quiet and forcing ccp to gather information via discovery
the meeting minutes for the first csm 5 summit at the ccp headquarters in reykjavik are now available click here to take a look
thanks for the sticky navigator
oo
good and timely communication but yall ccp could have condensed it a bit something likewould have conveyed exactly the same message and you wouldnt have needed to put in anything like as much effort to produce it ho hum
good job mynxee 
so  eh  the gist of everything is that1 ccp is not going to care for eve until after dust 514 so around end of 20112 because of a few years of what hard work incarna and dust are going to take all their attention leaving just room for a little distractions to integrate incarna and dust with3 ccp thinks the state of the cluster is just peachy4 the very instrument they advertised to be awesome feedback and work as instrument for gamedesign and customer represenation has been prenerfed by ccp because all the planning and scheduling has already been done by ccp in other words the csm can now feedback until it sees blue in the face but ccp is already under way and aint stoppingwhat am i missing
thanks to mynxee and the csm5 teamtamber
this would be comedy gold if it werent for the fact that its quite seriousreally goes to show just how out of touch the senior staff are with the players and how unwilling they are to enter into any sort of real compromise or debatecsm was all about putting power into the hands of the players and making ccp more accountable to them this appears to have failedim quite glad the format of the summit was changed and this terms chair has a good set of balls and is willing to tackle the challenges i think this just about sums up the complete disconnect that the management have
csm asked about instation fighting or aggressive behaviors ccp would not promise either in the near term it has to be kept in mind that the basic idea regarding incarna is to socialize not to have an arena an analogy with airports has been used in the past and that vision was further reinforced in hjaltis book eve the burning lifeif that is any indication for how ccp do their research then sit on it for years and then get to work with it i get scared sure nice book but it is quite old by now i do hope they actually did some serious and current market studies on mmos that have failed because of airport analogy development 
its all a bit depressing how can we fault ccp for reinvesting so much of their income into the game yet how can we praise them when the expenditure is producing so little benefit to its customerswell on the bright side at least we know where we stand now all i can say is incarna had better be ing awesome ccp because if weve put up with your terrible game quality since december 09 and all we get to make up for it is talk in some stupid ebar then there will be hell to paystart fixing  now start telling us what youve fixed start telling us what youre going to fix next star wars the old republic launches soon and those guys are gonna eat your lunch unless you shape the  up
when you see it
i am here on page 1
yeah we never said ccp didnt allocate enough resources to eve we tried to explain that we feel resources are not allocated to the right areas fixing stuff making sure existing content is good etc however unfortunately it didnt seem like ccp understood that at allthis actually needs some refiningccp explorer did come to us with code metrics  and it is clear that from a software engineering point of view the eve code base is better than ever however as we all know this is not reflected in the game experience vuk lau showed them a video of how to deal with module lag which actually seemed to surprise some of the devs at ccp and we talked to the developers who actually work on the cluster code they do accept that there is more lag than before  both in big fleets and small gangs  and the core cluster team is working on finding out why and then fixing itit does seem somewhat telling that ccp comes up with code metrics when we come with complaints about the user experience the two are not related and to me it hints at either a disconnect between the devs and the game they make or an effort to fool the csm into thinking things are ok however the team that is actually responsible for fixing the lag is aware that it exists and that it is worse than before whether or not they can fix it any time soon is a totally different question however
i guess that by now you and all the other csms have realised that fixing this is your primary mission all the other stuff  fixing this buffing that tweaking the other  are secondary subaspects of your main job
these minutes are a joke a joke that is not funny
i agree theres no doubt that plenty of resources are being thrown at eve to improve it upwards just not enough or none at all to improve it sideways hence the other quote in my poast
we were aware of that before the summit and in many issues that were discussed low sec 00 factional warfare the winter expansion etc we brought up the need to focus on existing issues and working with what is already in eve it wasnt just during the excellence discussion that we talked about this it was a red thread throughout the 3 days of meetingsunfortunately ccp still seems to focus heavily on attracting new customers or getting former players to resub with new content rather than improved existing content  and their increasing subscriber numbers support that belief it is my belief that properly marketted old content could achieve the exact same thing but with a multi million dollar budget at stake ccp doesnt seem to be convinced of that the only way to convince them would be a drop in subscriber numbers but most of us are still too invested in this game to unsubscribe enmasse
you know all good intentions from csm and staff aside that just means  when they people making the decisions at ccp on commercial objectives acquisition targets over retention and resource allocations have zero clue on the state of the product or even of its reception by customers in these days of social networking theres an interesting thread on shc yeah i know shocking in its own right  bitter vets constructively analysing meeting minutes eve dust incarna and ccp with surprisingly more politesse and aptitude then here but even there the same fundamental conclusions are being drawn it has no importance whatsoever whether devs want to do the right thing when the people making the decisions actively or passively wreck the processes involvedlook no disrespect to what is visibly a lot of hard work of the csm as a real team in spite of the  we saw here t times nor to the hardworking staff who try to build this universe but it is as if at some point there just is a lot of misinformation or even emo on the state of the product and those annoying customers who dare to want to enjoy a game respectively but i guess that is what you get for staying clear from proper communication and immersion and yes maybe as players we ourselves a even guilty of some of the roots of that after all for several years people chased after devs playing the game as if it were a jihad sure sometimes for good reasons in the days of corruption but at some point that just turned into a spanish inquisitionmaybe its an idea to start a little reconciliation on several levels cause with what eve is you cant manage development of the product or the business without living and breathing what you buildit is amazing that it seems necessary for players to educate the people behind the brand on the nature and state of their product even to educate them on the risk this places on the value of both brand and ip  regardless of hard work of actual developers these minutes really show where the structural problems are
cant they see what an incredible commercial risk they are taking with this im not referring to the mythical risk of mass unsubscribing  people love eve they want to believe so those who are invested in it stick around and do come back but getting caught in an ever accelerating rat race of increasing resource capacity while the ratio of resource allocations required for acquisitions is not in proportion to that increase in resource capacity thats just nuts besides there are structural business development limitations to that which traditionally force enterprise forces to turn their products to legacy mode and seek other products typically within the same ip but those who engage in such rat races they nor their products survive in the end because it creates a momentum which is always counterproductive to the original core principles and strengths of the original foundation they established for the ip
the question that you need to ask nathan is why are you measuring your development budget against other game companies do they have the same business eve business model game archictecture and vision that would make such comparisons valid yes or noat the end of the day its a pointless number statistic that serves little purposeergo he needs to come up with a better justificationi think by now he should have realized that the playercommunity climate is unhappy and that is being reflected by the pushing that csm5 is giving it also doesnt take a genius to gauge the general mood of the forum postings lets see how things develop from here  continual denial or some coursecorrections
aye youre right maybe it might be worth pointing out to ccp that the used to play eve but left because finally lost patience with gamebreaking bug 153 demographic is worth chasing especially since fixing every such gamebreaking bug adds value to each new subscription
im confused first ccp says that they are committed to excellence and then they say no to every request for fixes or polishi knew things were bad but the minutes show even greater problems well i hear that perpetuum is shaping up real nice
good stuffreading through it is amasing how determined ccp staff are to ignore the advice the csm gives their defensiveness comes across as downright unprofessional and discourteous as well getting the idea that they no longer respect their playersat least this time around the csm are forcing ccp to admit that theyre letting the game rot in favour of their pet projects which allows us as consumers to decide how much effort we want to dedicate to the future of a game which the management is too tight to alot resources to fixeditapologies to developers not your decision as to what you are allowed to do
i just dont understand because at one point in time you had fixed lag to a degree that made everyone jump up and down and praise you ccp we were all saying finally this game is going somewhere now and then you introduced a new patch with new features and we went back to worse than ever amounts of lag maybe the people youre putting on this issue arent competent or maybe you really just dont care but thats all we really want you dont have to give us tons of new game content every 6 months we make the game content ourselves thats the whole point of eve just give us a lag free experience
the devs need to realize that there is no foragainst no rightwrong and no enemies here there is only the possibility of working together with what is possibly their most effective market research team for current subscribersthe csm or not working together with if there is no recognition that the aims and goals of both ccp and the ccp customers are nearly identical then there can be no progress
considering the minutes the primae makes perfect sense as a gift reflecting the stance of ccp management here have something for free from us it looks totally cool and is unique and especially made for this new feature and you better be happy about it because it took us much work to do and despite that were not going to charge you for it extra yet it is pretty much useless
well said
i kinda think the devs do realize thatits management that seems to need to corify this message but well said mazz
very well put
well put justwhat if that target group and their market research team is seen by ccp  probably at high management level  as not so important after all  as it seems it is the only explanation to meall i can say these minutes have really shaken my trust in ccp already dented but just a bit beforeafter all who and how can assure that fate of foty incarna will be better than rest of eve once we are clearly told to stfu all whats left is forum graphomania i have a topic for speculation then what new shiny will doom incarna to be left in halffinished state forever
it already is clear from these minutes that there are severe and structural bottlenecks in communication inside ccp what surprised me even shocked me is that while players often think that there is a big gap between players and devs the gap between execs and devs is much much bigger a second observation is that these minutes make shockingly clear that on the executive level and probably also on a businessproduct owner decision point there is something really really wrong they either do not get the correct information on state of affairs events and products or they discard it maybe indeed based on old trauma too much work taken over the fun or growing into their version of bitter vet facing screaming hordes or the people who control the information flow have either such issues or suffer from cubicle  little kingdom syndromes a third observation is that ultimately where they could with less work but more vision establish ccp as something truly awesome and the sci fi mmo as their default ip and market without competing with anyone else anywhere they insist on basing commercial decisions on incorrect definitions engaging in ventures while step by step they take away parts of the core company and product values that made this epic ride possible and as a fourth observation as much as i hate to make the analogy there is something very unsettling about their approach on customer acquisition over customer retention weve seen this before in damage control efforts in swg as long as the product is not legacy build upon customers wanting to make it work and recycle subscriber groups as you proceed to legacy status
heh if this is the attitude that ccp is taking towards their product for the next 18 months minimum then i think it may just be time to unsubat least sc 2 will be out soon to occupy some of my time
what we have here is a failure to communicate some men you just cant reach so you get what we had here last week which is the way he wants it well he gets it i dont like it any more than you men
looks like i now have some light afterdinner reading
so they are adding a brandnew feature that you guys arent fond of and is going to impact the game in a new way as opposed to the goal stated which is refining pi polishing and prepping for future expansions without going into details on what it isshould we worryoh and good job guys thanks especially for mentioning new players barrier to getting into 00 did ccp respond with anything to that
this is pretty sad when we are told that devs play the game well then probably it means that they dont play in nullsec and that explains all as trebor stated and as anyone know with the current gameplay mechanics lag will never be defeated that means the sov warfare will always have problems and personally i think that this is one of the main reason why comquerable 00 is empty you have to fight for your territory but the fight is the most frustrating thing to do in eve and many people would give away their sov for fun after all this is a gamein the end lag in sov warfare will never be solved and non masochist pilots in the long run will avoid fleet battles like hell like i do and assigning a permanent scrum team to monitor balance and work out a new life for nullsec would be the solutionthe fact is that nullsec is the most important part of eve its the only source of many materials the main drain of ships and capitals its the highest and biggest of aims and its the place where the stories the politics the power dynamics the player organization the biggest of every time and virtual world ever existedeves nullsec is the biggest monument of mmo gaming but with this policy it will never reach its full potential and decline
good to see what lots of us have been saying  the csm is a complete waste of time and effort and the summit meeting minutes proves it categorically it is there only for the small uberl33t player base who seem to think they control the game  whaaa we here you all cry 1 of the player base has a problem with lag  fix it now whaaa you cry again our life in lowsec is pointless  fix it now seriously it must of been like kindergarten for the ccp attendees listening to you all whine away tearstreaked powerpoint presentations and all seriously there are issues here that were raised in csm1 in fact most of the points covered in this document are just rehashes of issues that have been there since inception each year you guys seem to find more issues to have a sook over but it still seems to escape your attention  you are all irrelevant to the game and to the majority of the player baseand its funny to see that instead of 3 days in iceland you now want more as ccp rightly point out even a month of yakking amongst yourselves would still no accomplish anything at least someone has their feet firmly planted on the ground just reiterates the fact that this is nothing more than a pointless waste of time and effort  a sop to the cool kids to make them feel good about themselves the funniest thing though about this whole exercise is that the csm now has yet another pointless document to wave around to prove their relevancygive yourselves a golf clap for a job well done
ccp we dont care what players think as long as the money keeps rolling in everything is peachy we prefer to work on incarna and dustthats what i get from reading them minuteswhen in reality they should be fixing bugs that been around for years broken sov mechanics and releasing expansions if you can call them that that are full of bugs and released in beta state also your customer service is pure  cccp get your act together
so the csm isnt very good at getting under managements skin and making them work at fixing all the old holes in eve that sucks we can agree on that but if we do as you say and disband the csm what exactly do you propose as a solution let ccp management live in the land of deceptive stats and ooh shiny until someone makes a space mmo competently and eve collapses let them get their inspiration for what eve should become from forum trolls or are you just going to poke at them with pins in a voodoo doll until they get a clue seriously the csm is not perfect but what you propose is stupid
i had a theory that a legal background would be a useful attribute for a csm member especially with issues relating to negotiations ndas and the like but approximately 98 of voters disagreed with me 
fait accomplis usually are handled quickly
minutes are now available
tldr  we are going to keep shoving our half finished and unneeded features down your throat for at least a year and a half longer before we even consider fixing all our broken poo poo and nonfunctional core gameplayhope that helpsedit my hat is off to the csm team for their hard hard work against these odds though for this i salute you o7
nice work team
lag will always be an issue however eve but eve is now from a technical standpoint in a better state than it has ever been if it werent so sad id laugh
it was mentioned by ccp that the data does not seem to support that polished quality sells better than new featuresccp stated that once incarna and planetary interactiondust 514 are fully implemented focus will probably shift far more towards improve
first time reading the csm minutes lost all faith in the entire process ccp get the csm to do more than the csm get ccp to do didnt realise it worked the wrong way roundthe next 18 months of ccps schedule are already accounted for before the csm even gets to iceland and all of this time is ccp doing what they want to do whats the point of the csm except to give inside information to ccpby existing features they mean dust 514 and incarna once implemented
yeah there were some positives in there i mean some stuff that was good and encouraging but what the  oveur this is supposed to be the game that you love eve is supposed to be the game that you guys created because its what you wanted to play what the  are you thinking
as usual the minutes show that the csm did not present one issue to improve the game and rather presented a series of whines about the state of content i feel bad for ccp having to listen to these people complain complain and complain without presenting anything constructive glad to see the minutes show that ccp is giving the due attention to the csm that it deserves zero
thanks for posting 3

csm remained unconvinced of ccps commitment to excellence even after nathans arguments were heard ccp disagreed strongly with the claim that it isnt committed to excellence and feels that the resources being used to constantly improve eve online are a clear sign of this commitmentthe csm suggested a dedicated polish team to be established with players being informed as to what they intend to work on during each expansion ccpUFFFDs answer to that is that there will be no polish patrol team for the next 23 expansions even though players feel there should bebut they put as much ressources into eve atm ok
thatUFFFDs basicly what i got out of it yeah
as i read through these minutes i see alot of hard work and good ideas lets give this csm the time it needs to start pushing change forward rome wasnt built in a day delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
if these minutes did not make it abundantly clear that there is no pushing to be had you are seriously delusional
and here is what is wrong with the csmwhen it happens to fit nicely in to whatever youre currently doing as opposed to realising that these are the biggest issues that the players of eve have managed to get the csm to bring up and put dedicated resources on the jobthis is also why the csm will continue to fail to gain the full supporttrust of the playerbase they were hobbled from the outset
this is a disaster i wouldnt expect actiblizz to act that foolish we need a mother of all thrednaughts in gdccp said that they wont fiximprove anything relating to lowsec faction warfare and 00 for next year and a half at least nor will there be time to fix many minor bugs and issues nor for any improvements to uionly thing to expect in next 18 months is minor tweaks to pi and maybe something called combat expansion that if i understood correctly isnt a major ui change but just improvements to combat notifications and stuffeverything that csm pointed out is a critical issue has been completely ignored by ccp or brushed off with not in next 18 monthswe need a mother of all trednaughts in gd and entire csm resigning unanimously ok dust is separate game even though it has taken critical amount of resources form eve and ccp invested a lot and will be ed if they dont get it out and recover at least some of money invested in it they wont make money on it console shooter market is oversaturated by aaa titles of big publishers that have marketing budgets higher then ccps yearly totals but still maybe ccp will sell enough boxes to recover some of money spent on itbut incarna is for us the eve players and no one really cared about it ever it was a nice gimmick promised for distant future does anyone understand how insane does nothing will be fixed or improved for at least next 18 months sondcsm was supposed to be voice of players to ccp ccp completely ignored it what are we left with 
dust a game pc owners wont even be able to play  and walking in stations something players stopped giving a  about years ago  are both taking all the dev time away from the real gamethus leaving ccp with no dev time to put into real issues affecting here and nowunfortunately ccp have their heads up their asses on this one and i dont see this changing theyve effectively commited to abandoning eve for the next 1 12 to 2 years because theyve got so much tied up with dustincarna  that much was made clear in the minutesthey seem to think we can be won over with shinys  and to a degree it is unfortunately true dust is just a shiny were not going to have access to so they seem to have forgotten that were not going to be too happy that all the devs are ing around with that insteaddo ccp really think we want wis over fixing any one of the major issues they made vauge promises over in the csm try fixing what the players raise as issues instead of giving us half assed mini games which is all incarna will be for a long time
just for the sake of irony i have lifted the following from the company pageemphasis mine
at least the development time spent on incarna didnt interfere with the normal development resources allocated to internet spaceships
2 things come to mind reading that sounds like a jita scammer or a used car salesman on the interweb selling a clunker
yeah im really pleased that ccp flatout lied to us about thatincarna as a lowresource bonus from wod development sweet nice thinking good synergy thereincarna as a giant devguzzling resource hog that leaves the game mired in rotting pig for 18 months not so nice you ing morons what the  were you thinking you took a giant  all over your core game then lied to your customers about how much it cost whos shortbus genius strategy was that1  over the veteran playerbase who run multiple accounts for a long time2 in favour of new players who run one account for a few months3 4 profit
this is really ing depressingspeaking on behalf of ccp nathan disagreed strongly with the claim that ccp isnt committed to excellence he pointed out that ccp probably spends a bigger part of its income on development than most other large established game companies he stated that this is a clear sign of this commitmentno it really isnt its a sign that you do more development not put more polish on that developmentit was mentioned by ccp that the data does not seem to support that polished quality sells better than new featuresindeed unfortunately word of mouth sells even better  and theyre running grave risks with thata specific low sec expansion is not on the 18 month planfail it doesnt even have to be focused on low sec theres a lot that can be done without making a whole goddamn expansionthe csm suggested a dedicated polish team to be established with players being informed as to what they intend to work on during each expansion ccp UFFFDs answer to that is that there will be no polish patrol team for the next 23 expansions even though players feel there should befail this is what you need most honestlyccp stated that fw is not a priority and no fwrelated changes will be considered until after incarna and dustfail so many things that can be fixed so little incentive to do it just another ccp failurei am so tempted to offer to work on eve for free in my spare time but i dont know that i want to work on a mmo that seems determined to wallow in pig  until it dies a diseased husk why is ccp so determined to faillianged formatting
seconded whats the ing point of the csm if ccp are just going to ignore everything thrown at them deny anythings wrong and bulldoze ahead with a gamebreaking or in this case not even gamerelated schedule anyway
the content of the meetings minutes is disappointing ccp gave csm4 the same 18 month time frame which means they added stuff in that ignored csms stakeholder input or it was just a smoke screen in the first place incarna taking dev resources is a new line a definite departure from their earlier statements that no eve development resources were being diverted to it theres a possible upside in that the incarna release will be that much better for it but given postapocrypha history and ccps tone im not hopeful thats the caseon the minutes format action points are an awesome addition to these things on a lot of levels csm transparency ccp accountability adding content to the document itselfon the process csms stakeholder status is clearly in name only and least until dust and incarna are released the next test of it will be if ccp actually includes them their at that time 3 year backlog and their feedback on those releases properly once those major products have cleared the pipe never the less csm does provide some valuble services to the community not in the least getting more dev blogs out about things important to us and being able to provide quality feedback of opportunity like pointing the devs to the fleet interface for lag reduction csm4 and the 100k skillpoint reimbursement csm5 among many other instances and finally i find it to continue to be funny that ccp knows it has a forum problem in that it feels like it was made in the 1990s but refuses to fix it this is of course despite their quantityofexcellencedevbudget and the fact that there are several free forums that are unbelievably better than the current one
hrm the csm was made up of members who were with one exception quality representatives dedicated to their constituents and improving the game hopefully recent events will allow the csm to refocus on getting  done without impact from one members personality disorder because honestly we really really need something like that now ccp has steadily been harming the game over the last short while from breaking fleet combat with dominion to churning out a slew of halfbaked releases that are never touched again they seem to well simply not get itrational folks dont expect miracles from the csm and we understand that youll be shut down and handwaved away as long as ccp is determined to behave in such a manner we accept that and wont fault you for it but we do expect that youll take the opportunity that ccp has given you and keep hammering into the breach until the csm really has enough heft to make sure that ccp understands that a commitment to excellence doesnt mean commitment to releasing lots of broken crap eve is currently running on the chinese industry model and someone has to be there to point out that maybe cutting corners isnt worth it in the long run the csm has their work cut out for em and it may take this entire term plus several others but something has to be done best of luck to the csm because theyll need it
hooray i am reading them right now here are some things of interest to methis is disappointing because this is very little benefit over people putting together proposals and posting them into the ideas and features forum other than forcing a response from ccp of course i dont expect ccp to hand csm the ability to change anything at a whim  its ccps product  but at the same time its very disappointingthis however would be really nice if the items in the backlog actually get development time how often are items in the backlog worked on if the backlog was made available would it be possible to see which items are being actively developed that would be really greatwhile i can see nathans point here i disagree it isnt excellence when features are released buggy and fell unfinished and then left to linger i would rather have fewer features added each expansion and have the time spent on polish and maintenance eve is a great game but when you hear about features that have been broken and unfinished for years its dishearteningthis is great news to me as i do low sec exploration quite a bit even if there isnt a definite schedule for this kind of thing knowing that theyre already aware of the issue and intend on fixing it is a good thingalso excellent to be honest pi doesnt thrill me at all but i do dabble and im hoping that it is improved upon the dedicated resources are good as well though i do wonder about priorities  why isnt there a dedicated fw resource or backlog resource for example i know pi will be linked to dust butyes yes yes the eve dev blogs are one of my favorite things because it gives us a lot of great information about what is going on behind the scenes and theyre almost always interestingwoohoo go get emand this helps lowsec become unique interesting and desirable how knowing that theres no plans at all for low sec for over a year and a half is extremely disappointing to me there is so much potential here so many great ideas low sec is a large part of eve territorywise and theres no interestwell lets get crankin any information on how you guys would like to go about doing this and how the community will be involved
did you miss the part where they said were not fixing anything for the next 18 months minimum and lowsec not for the nexrt 23 expansions 
this really irks me theres a lot of problems with fw fixing even some of the minor issues would be a huge boon fw is a fantastic feature for all the reasons mentioned and i know that i had a heavy interest in fw amarr victor minmatards   until i experienced how broken it was this is the kind of thing that makes the player base question ccps commitment to excellencehell yes im really looking forward to this one the tech dev blogs are the best of them all  i always learn somethingand i agree with them on this i dont see why it would be worth their time to work on something that a very small minority of the player base would be usingyay cheer victory looking forward to thisthis is great but i wasnt sure if this meant that roles were going to be revamped any time soon or what it may look like can you provide more details a new role system is something i have wanted for a long long long time and it would benefit every corporation in eve equallyeve is more than space ships though it is the market it is production it is social networking it is crime and punishment space ships are a big part of eve yes but not the only part it seems that ccps big vision is a universe simulation game someone has a bigger vision here and i think its cool and has a lot of potential  if it is released and polished and not neglectedbut i like tanking multiple torpedo batteries in my stealth bomberalso greatoverall i hope that ccp and nathan in particular dont feel like were attacking them and trying to put them down as players we put a lot of time and effort into eve and we care about it we just want it to be as best as it can bethanks for the minutes
no i didnt i also didnt miss the part where ccp asked the csm to start putting something together now implying that the proposal will get some attention once they have their current priorities finished ccp wouldnt have asked the csm to do something if they werent even mildly interested in the resultsjust because they dont have time now doesnt mean that we should just throw up our arms and give up  but perhaps im just not quite so focused on defeat and cynicism
what an interesting response seeing as he had a very valid pointwould you happen to be protecting something like say a free trip to iceland where you talk about a video game maybe get access to some upcoming changes pass along acquired information to your alliance mates seems to me that he is isnt the one who is terrible you would be the recipient of that designation in this discussion or are you saying that you dont have access to information being a csm member that wouldnt benefit your alliance mates after all why would you have to sign an nda if you werent exposed to sensitive information it isnt like the csm members have a great track record for keeping their yaps shut and not abusing their position in some way shape or formin fact wasnt there a csm who just recently got kicked off for violating the ndait will be nice once ccp gets rid of the csm garbage and brings something more interesting to the player base in its place
its funny that you are surprised that a csm member would respond in this fashion if you care to browse the forums youll see that this sort of response is pretty typicalits a shame really but understandable  when you are in a position of trying to defend the indefensible you resort to puerile insults and name calling and as history in these forums shows we are yet to see any members of the csm refrain from it as a last though quite often first resortthe sooner this farce is ended the better for the player base
either that or he knows that any defense he gives will fall on deaf ears so he doesnt bother trying i wouldnt you tell me what argument would make you consider stopping your whining
qedyou think that shouting conspiracy and placing question marks next to my loyalty and motives based on that is a valid point
who knew it was a yesno question
after reading the minutes its clear the csm should resign in the most public way possible ccp is quite honest in stating they do not care about anything but getting more shiny new content out the door which will be abandoned later in favour of more shine new content
it is evident that sokratesz acts in an unprofessional manner and thereby undermines the csm this is widely recognized as is demonstrated from his public scolding by the chair of the csm so too i suspect someone talked with him again he has been conspicuously absent from certain forums after his willful ignoring of ccps request for circumspection was pointed out so i can well understand your suspicion that he is on the csm simply to collect insider information yet perhaps we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater other members of the csm are trying their best only an adequate amount of time will tell whether ccp will ultimately take them seriously or not this csm has just begun its work let us give them a chancewe may be better served by demanding bad apples like sokratesz resign and letting others with a more professional attitude continue to do their best by us all delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
broken recordwe get the message you have major personal issues with soks now can you stop spamming your hatemail across the whole of this forum its well past boring and repetitive now
sad to say that i got the same impression
you really are the gift that keeps on giving
yes reliable honest law abiding people like your darling ankh oh wait
or python injecting gankers  oh wait btw  nice synergy with the corp name too helicity
hmm  lets see if an exercise in basic comprehension will make a difference to a certain csm member and his altif something is indefensible  there is no defence that can be offered so of course by definition any defence offered will by rights fall on deaf ears as at the end of the day its all just nothing but smoke and mirrors just offering a qed makes it painfully obvious that even the smoke and mirrors are failing to show that this particular house of cards fell down ages ago and truly we dont need to shout conspiracy or place question marks next to your loyalty and motives  you and the others on the csm do a good enough job doing that as it is we just nudge you in the direction you were all naturally travelling alongnot that in the end it matters  as the summit meeting minutes show  its all an irrelevancy anyway
go ahead and submit weve got two weeks to get your official status sorted with ccp plenty of time amirite
how about submitting something that the player base actually wants say like dismissing the csm entirelyafter all it only garners a max 126 of interest from the player baseit doesnt actually improve anything in the gamea complete waste of resourcesstating a problem without a solution isnt very beneficial so here are some suggestions1 replace csm with evetv the number of viewers for the last tournament exceeded the voter turnout for the last csm that in itself is goo enough justification to get rid of the csm2 replace the csm by hiring a person to go through the forums and bring up valid suggestions for improvement far more effective than the csm the members of which who are only in the csm for the free trip to iceland and to get sensitive info to benefit their alliances and most importantly less costlyand if this doesnt strike the csms fancy which most likely wont how about adding in an additional voting option for things such as evetv or abolish the csm on the ballot for the next electionoh and a protrip stop trying to act like you are relevant in changing things all this formality garbage is for nothing no software production house takes its player base seriously for suggestions so you can drop the charade
you are not the player base
qftcan i suggest that the csm add progress update on ccp deliverables as one of the standing agenda items for fortnightly meetings why not make keeping ccp on their toes wrt csm issues an obvious part of the official business of the csm
stellar idea see what i did thar consider it done points to agenda
raw logs are now available on the eve wiki or as a text downloadif you want a tldr then the voting results are on the csm databasethe wiki summary and pdf will be out later this week im catching up on the missing minutes with trebors help
reading the raw logs makes me wonder how anything gets done in a bureaucracy the chairperson becomes an egomaniac if they werent before and everyone else concentrates on their own agenda with little to no regard for others opinions or suggestionsjust how raw are the raw logs as im fairly certain there was more ramblings edited out than left in why not have two chat windows one informal the other formal that way the csm appears to be far more efficient and professional to the publicjust an idea
the raw logs are not edited for content to the point of not even being run through a spell checker for formatting i remove the date from the timestamps as suggested by another playerthe only time i remove content is when there is any nda information but in the very rare times that happens i put in a comment such as removed due to nda no secret edits just everything from start of meeting till it is closedwe could easily have private channel discussions but that wouldnt be very good for the transparency of the process there is even a specific rule that while a meeting is in progress everything is posted in that channel
i thought this post was going to be about how long it took you to destroy a dramielleaving disapointed
marlona sky is a bit like hey youonly more obnoxiousjust as stupid though

since youre not going to fix anything until incarnadust123 i wont be playing it until then either this issue gets my support

nice csm minutes the guys making the decisions in ccp dont listen to the player base and in the end it will hurt the company
i dont think i ever gotmto the point of actually supporting this but after reading the minutes from the summit i figured its time to unsub gonna make as much noise as i possibly can before my sub runs out however
usually dont support topics here and all but i have to support this proposal after reading the last csm notes

more quality please
this please
meh i have to do thisi love eve please dont destroy what i love fix the broken stuff give us an improved gamei dont care for features right now an expansion devoted to bugs and issues would be what most here would wanti still love ccp my devotion is strong but not infinitely big at some point i might break as wellincarna and dust may be nice things but if it destroys eve in the progress whats the point of the dream
fully supportingknowing corporate behavior all too well however i fear that the only fix we get will either get no meeting minutes next time or everything being under ndai just wish i had read the minutes before extending yesterday pleas take this as a simple unemotional statement and nothing else
fully supportedid much rather have less content with more polish the idea that the opposite is more appealing to consumers is just boneheaded
1ing dis
after reading the minutes its clear too me we all should support this
cannot support this enough
if ccp actually stuck to the excellence mark on dust and incarna then i would be okay with waiting till they went by to get back to existing contentbut i dont believe they will if the last two expansions are anything to go by if the minutes are a sign of things to comedust and incarna will be halffinished and they will both flop dramatically  this means less money for eve it means dust which sounds like a potentially really awesome thing for eve will not have the activity numbers to make it worth bringing up to scratch either and incarna wont get the support it needs to really become something worth havingccp need to reduce the number of expansions and improve the qualitythey need to go back to previous expansions and bring them up to the mark of excellenceand they need to realise that eve has been built on slowly increasing subscriber numbers of exceptionally loyal fans  the quantity over quality mentality they give cannot continue to support eves slow but inevitable growth  it will make this game a boom and bust like so many before it

they are rubbish just get rid of them give a flat 5 to stats give a flat 11 i dont really care
good ideai agree with youccp hurry to do this
if ccp had any idea how many problems this would clear up it would have already been done
that said ccp have shown no interest in addressing the playbases concerns and wish lists for factional warfareas long as the 00 power blocks cannot specifically join a militia then yes do it
10
agreed please create fw alliances with restrictions and protections to keep existing power blocs outalso make system occupancy mean something whizzing around the plex buttons for no apparent gain other than the arbitrary change of title at the top of the page loses its appeal after the first hundred plexif one side gains occupancy then give them something for example disallow new pos for the losers or give the winners the ability to use jump bridges give the winners of system occupancy something to keep their pilots motivated give them something usefulthank you ccp
this is great idea it will make fw more fun
10
i the noob of sneaks support this idea for it is very idealthat is all
aye allow alliances in fw as long as the member corps meet the faction standing criteria now in placealso like the idea of tying fw alliances to occupancy make orbiting the coin worth something other than victory points when an fw alliance achieves occupancy not sovereignty they can use cyno jammers or j bridges or exclusive station rights or a big permanent faction standing boost for all corps members there has to be some reward
guys please keep occupancy as a separate topic  do not let this die on offtopic discussions thnx snake
im not in a corp in faction warfare but i do support this this will make fw more organised i believe and lots more people should participate in fw almost 70 are just dead in some channels too busy doing something else lol
bamno sov idea is great
one problem i see with lowsec is that its so allornothing compared to highsec 05 system is basically safe 04 is totally unsafe this leads carebears to only ever deal in highsec as the next danger level of 04 is totally unsafe full of 10 piratesis there a need for a more gradual dropoff how about in 04 concord turns up 50 of the time when you pirate but youre allowed to escape if you can 03 20 02 5 01 concord aint there  or something like thatthat might encourage carebears to accept the occasional lowsec mission if its in 04 or maybe pick up some goods from 03 rather than lowsec just not existing to them plus pirates would actually have to deal with real cops turning up sometimes not just gate guns2c
i support this proposal

this issue was brought up in the csm minutes here
ccp is working on walking in stations and dust after that eves subscribership will have gotten so low that they wont have the isk icelanic for improving blasters so no theyre never ever going to fix hybrids
the item of these three that i would address most directly is that space seems crowded i think the best way to address that is to add many more solarsystems eg 20 k new solarsystems rather than to increase the average solarsystemtosolarsystem route length which presumably would not change the universal average solarsystem populationhow about this as a middle ground substantially increase the length of highsec routes between the major hubs ensuring that there are much shorter eg 5UFFFD shorter lowsec routes between the same hubs
imho that wont help as long as there is a highsec route there will be autopilot freighters some perhaps even augmented with warptozero autopilot external programsmdd
as someone who is relatively new i find this idea really goodbut surely this has been suggested 100000 times over already
ive been championing this exact idea every now and again over the years i think i might even have a post somewhere in the assembly forum about itnever gotten much traction unfortunatelythe above being my main goal for making the changei dont see the need for this howeverit would simply get annoying
sounds like a good idea but if your just wishing for a way to get more pirate kills probably not gonna happen people will use jump freighters instead and not have to risk their precious cargo
i dont recall specifically where or when but dr econ says he wants central bank racial currency and few other absurd things
should probably be moved to assembly halli support this though but only if there are multiple losec paths between each region otherwise you just end up with 50 rancersshould be a high level of risk to travel between sectors but not guaranteed suicideneed to be careful about balancing though to avoid a mass exoidus of pilots back to their home regions
yes most are available only in their space but not all why not take it the whole way only bpos available for that race available in that empires space not to mention this would effect skills the mosti mean right now i looked up amarr cruiser in forge and its for sale in state war academy now this might be acceptable since amarr and caldari are allies but why is gallente cruiser available at the same locations 
sounds like a nightmare if you live in nullsec what currency would you use would a corp wallet need 4 wallets for each currency sounds like a mess
because gallente cruisers are the best back on the subject though as far as most skills go its already rough enough starting out in eve just trying to figure everything out much less making some poor noob fly 40 jumps just to pick up energy management from some amarr station who will probably end up going through lowsec because he doesnt know any betternow as far as racial ships yes i can agree that they should be separated just like the racial ship bpos currently are
more isk for my trade alts more killmails from lowsec for my pvp alt hhhhmmm sounds good to me
to get around this you could have 3 currencies amarrcaldari gallenteminimatar and then something sponsored by concordded the empires pay for what happens in their hilow sec space and concordded pays for what happens in 00 and maybe the x10 rated complexes in hisec itd be pretty easy to do some sort of rp explanation via some big schism that builds up over about two months before a patch with the reduced cooperation and monetary support from the empires concord would have to consolidate its patrols giving rise to increased low sec areas between the empiresall that being said though i would like to see some more reasons for people to spread out although im worried that tweaking drop rates like you suggested might give people too much of an incentive to stay in hisec which goes contrary to ccp trying to get more people into lownull
were becoming more civilized not less system security ought to be going up and not down to reflect this possibly some of the pipes could be determined by faction warfare ive always though system security ought to be unstable but just to go backwards while the game is going forward only makes sense from a profits point of view for traders makes no sense from any other viewpoint
huh this makes absolutely no sense four empires supposedly at peace with each other would make damned sure routes were clear and safe you dont need any change to make a pitch for different currencies trouble is if it did happen youd have every wannabe forex trader screwing things up in classic eve fashion anyway aint gonna happen too messy not needed at alland theres the nub you want to buff what is already the most most lucrative career in the game aint gonna happenjita is the trade capital caldari is the most popular race your proposals would not change that one whit this is the least rp conscious game ive yet to see and traders are the least interested in rp besides nothing you proposed would do anything towards creating racial flavourslowsec is a wasteland it needs something radical not tinkering with tarmac
i love the idea for lowsec border zones between empiresit would simultaneously stimulate low sec activity and create a more interesting global market
agreed and i believe i know why its too predictable what you exclaim hear me outthose bent on involuntary pvp aka pirates know that concord will not get involved in lowsec they know the damage they will get from gate  station guns they know how much of a security status hit they will take and how log they will have to rat to undo the damage should they so choosethose whod rather obliterate computercontrolled pixels aka carebears know that in lowsec they are up against both the pirates and the npcs they know that a ship fitted for best performance against npcs would be handicapped versus a pirate and a ship fitted for best performance against pirates would be underwhelming versus npcsand guess what very similar rules apply in highsec too the pirates know how long concord takes to respond and they work out where they can gank successfully hello hulkageddon carebears cry that this is unfair and that pirates should be denied insurance for such attacksand finally ccp bemoans the distribution of characters with gobs in highsec somewhat lesser numbers in 00 and lowsec being a ghost townclue stick time make the transition from highsec to lowsec less clearly defined i propose that concords response probability and time be functions of1 system security concord responds faster in higher security systems than in lower security systems no change the probability that concord responds at all is also partially a function of system security2 difference between aggressor and victims security status concords likelihood of responding is higher when the 100 pirate attacks the 50 carebear than it is when the 00 pirate attacks the 25 mission runner and when the 10 carebear chooses to aggress the characterwithalowersecstatus heh result lower highsec systems are a bit more dangerous higher lowsec systems are a bit less dangerous high sec status carebears can wander into higher lowsec with some confidence that maybe concord will come to their rescue or maybe not pirates can polish their sec status and then prowl the lower highsec systems looking for the next big target knowing that they get more useful time engaging and might get away scottfreeoverall make concords security status effects more of a continuum instead of the dichotomy they are nowmdd
eve has 4243k concurrent as any one time at least when ever i log in bloated numbers from a tournement weekend does not equate to a new all time high active subs its jus a benchmark on server resourcesand space would be less crowded if ccp would off its ass and balance out mission hubs instead of moving the player one jump out spread out the level 4 agents even more market hubs could spring up there are many systems with out even a station sometimes you get a chain of systems before hitting another station and some stations only have multiple level 12 or even have no agents at all and this isnt ded caldari have loads of combat agents from many different npc corps which is why its so popular while gallente have maybe 2 decent corps to run
the creation of lowsec borders between empires is a good idea multiple currencies not so good just far too complicated it wouldnt just act as a buff to bold traders compared to aping freighter pilots but would go a long way to fixing lowsecs problems1
i agree it is totally predictable what you propose would make it a bit more of a lottery for both sides which is good but i seriously doubt it would have a radical impact on lowsec population so heres an alternative  do away with low sec totally move some to high sec and some to null sec and have done with it
agreed lowsec between empires is a great idea different currencies not so great
1 supports this idea we might aswell get something usefull out of lowsec
actually just make highsec smaller lowsec serves a valuable purpose and is a different environment to null or highsec eve does not need more safe spacein terms of shipping things around its very easy to avoid gatecamps and station camps if you know how to and prepare adequately read blockade runners instaundock bookmarks and maybe a scout because there are no bubbles in short if you have balls and brains you can safely navigate through lowsec space and therefore profit if highsec hubs were fully separated by lowsec space and the number of lowhigh security border systems increased you would find that the number of chokepoint systems would diminish because of the porous border think of the brazilian police trying to stop drug runners in the amazon rainforest 
the lowsec borders sound like an awesome ideacurrencies not so much too complicated as stated above multiple times
i would support this on one condition cyno works in highsec for jump freighters onlythat way those that invest and are more then two accounts can haul large quantities of goods without having to take a freighter trough lowsecthat or give freighters low slots for warp stabs a huge downside of the lowsec borders between empires would be that eventually people will migrate to a single faction and do everything there missionmine and those are most of the players resulting in super busy caldari space and near empty amarr galente and minmatar space segregation isnt the best ideai dont see how this would benefit anyone but lowsec pirates but i do think the idea in itself is cool if this were to happen a few other changes would need to be done to balance it a bit in the freighter department
if someone takes the time and money to invest in a jump freighter they deserve to profit from its use as to your original point i am not a pirate so i wouldnt be out to get more pirate kills i am however training for transport ships ultimately the point im trying to make is that eve is big enough now to support four mostly independent population focal points in empire space instead of having everyone crowded around a string of centralized systems and a few scattered mission hubs the incentive to travel through lowsec to connect trade routes will stimulate population out there too which would only exponentially increase with the planned public missions that they spoke aboutvaro well i just plain disagree with your viewpoint as far as the multiple racial currencies piece that was not the focal point of my suggestion and was more of a throwaway off the cuff suggestionas far as your comment about buffing the most lucrative career in eve if you are talking about trade you are painting with too broad of a brush youve got to separate station trader from interregional trader or interracial trader and certainly the latter two are not even close to as lucrative as the former or to other career fields such as mission running ratting etci agree that station trading is the most bang for the buck but my suggestion wouldnt really change station trading would itaub
hmmm no what youre saying is i want to ignore this cool new lowsec barrier in complete safety while everyone poorer slogs through in hulltanked badgersspace would become homogenised as it is at present because the lure of empty say amarr space and skyhigh prices for corresponding faction items due to a lack of supply would pull in a lot of people industry and the market would follow this influx accordingly
it could be also a new role for the faction warfare  protect the borders and secure trade highways there lots of thing that could be made with that
it makes no sense for the empires not to secure their interconnecting routes they would loose profits and it would also be unwise diplomaticly
i must say i like the idea of separated regionsempires i do not however support the idea of different currencies in the empires
fully support this thread it could be the boost needed for the lowsecpirats were to sit in sea and wait for other boats travelling by their area to make money by market use this happened when the sea doesnt have secure area and travelling was quiet dangerous by now you have the opportunity to make the same with planes and have more security for cargo safe road is the empire connection between trade hub if these roads will be cut this will bring back piracy in line with other carriers and give lowsec better activity for market pvp exploration etcplz ccp just do it 
op if you recall and argue using history you might need to consider such things as the market order nerf and scc boost also the huge number of new traded items that makes jita the living beast it is check eve metrics for details the volumes and 
ahemmdd
soz reading the thread you and torn were the posts that made sense  corrected it
let me start by stating i hate low sec having said that i find this idea very interestinglet me comment on some statementslet me remind you of the empyrian age which brings me to i agree on that least rp consious gamer part nonetheless games changes based on the official back story still make more sense than all of a sudden out of the blue wtf planets kinda changescant be more complicated than pi or wis and it would add another money sink exchange feerate and even provide the chance to add an additional skill another money sink for lowering the ratefeei also agree that this thread would be better in assembly hall the op might consider reporting his own thread and ask for having it moved to assembly hall
it is a false asumption that the four empires would only benefit from secure trade in times of peace actually the coldwar is indeed one of the thriving factors that does generate the profits for them
i also like mdds suggestion  but they need not be exclusiveyou could improve lowsec generally as stated by mdd and further add lowsec paths between the various empiresas for incentives to risk goign through lowsec  simply create market rules andor scarcity of goods between the races that arent getting along for example  gallente ships cannot be sold on the market in caldari space or vice verse i even think the currencies would be interesting if not overly complex with taxes on currency exchanges etcafter pewpew eves market is its best resource no other mmo has as complex or rich a market this would be a nice addition that would provide additional opportunities for hauling as a miniprofession it might also develop some interesting citizenpolice forces for those lowsec pathways 
it would make rp sense to have boycotts on gallente anything in caldari space but that would also kill markets which might not be bad but its reducing marketingmanufacturing areas for profitid rather see you cant build anything gallente in caldari space stations but you can at poses and you can sell them in caldari spacethis would mean1 you have to travel to gallente space to pick up the bpo or buy the overpriced bpo from jita2 you have to build in gallente space and haul or deploy a pos in caldari space and build at the currently 11 waste multiplier ship assembly arrays3 buy ships from gallente space which sell cheaper because of cheaper build costs haul them to jitaall the while taking the risk of transporting either ships or bpos across lowsecsif you want to build nonlocal racial stuff you have to do it from a pos i could definitely support that
im not convinced that driving people towards poses is a good thing for starters poses are corporate assets not personal assets the roles interface is already a mess imagine how much worse eve life will be when you push more people to have to deal with it actually i think you sencnes owe a fine for even suggesting such an idea pay chribba hell see that it is properly disbursed to a worthy charity but i get what youre trying to do introduce more racial effects into the markets and agree that appears to be a worthy goalbut i believe that the npc seeding of racial items should be addressed and from a programmatic point of view it seems like a trivial change for ccp it has the added effect of stimulating more playerrun economies skillbook  blueprint tradingalternative to pos bonusing have station assembly lines provide some bonuspenalty assessed because of the npcs standing to the race so for example carthum conglomerates assembly lines would provide some build bonus time resource efficiency for amarr blueprints neutral for caldari blueprints and penalize for gallente and minmatar blueprints has the same effect of making building stuff in its racial home better without the unwanted effect of pushing people to posesmddedit correct spelling of sencnes name sorry bout that also added alternative idea to pos bonusing
i doubt well ever see such a report even if we requested it but id be interested to know how many noncaldari things are built in station slots in caldari space and i agree pos pushing is not a good idea it would place demand on pos fuel and cost more to run my poses  so i would refine my statement tohave it cost 11 material multiplier for all t1 and t2 nonlocal racial items being built in stations make sure if you build say a thorax in caldari space at a station its 11x and at a pos it costs 11 too at the moment its only 1 and adjust local racial t2 ships to have a 1 multiplier at poses this means itll be cheaper to build t2 ships in that empires space at station and at pos and everything nonempire costs 10 more to buildcreate some real need for haulers to go from empire to empire picking up local manufactured t1 and t2 items for sales in other regions taking the homogenization out of eve againedit  after youre second edit my post is redundant but i like the way we think either a bonus for racial or a penalty for nonracial items in each empires space is something worthy of a csm topic
as a middle ground between cant build other race ships in stations  use pos and build where you like you could restrict building to the racial stations in the foreign empirestaken the gallente ship from the example you can build it anywhere in gallente empire or anywhere in gallente  minmatar empire or in gallente  minmatar stations in any of the other empiresnot sure though if the distribution of those stations would allow for this stations as in stations controlled by a npc corporation aligned with gallente empire
i wonder how many iterations it would require to get to this little lot to a noned state
umm because im a nerd i agree four distinct currencies would be a pain to keep track of would the nerds like any of us like it maybe probably would the mainstream computer gamer like it hassle  no if this type of system was implemented i would advocate for no designated currency in nullsec lawless space would most likely recognize the factional currency with the most purchasing power at the time however it neednt be so large alliances could say we only take tritanium and in effect you would trade trit at their stations in exchange for goodsservicesas for getting rid of the hisec highways sure id support that i agree that it would probably achieve the ops goal of lowering the crowds in some areas
i think the op has a good idea it would add excitement and challengesit could create an incentive for more group play in trading if there were lucractive arbitrage profits where a corp controling a couple low sec systems could escort a jump freigter to cynos on both sides perhaps the trader would be in corp or perhaps escort corps could build enough trust and repuation to charge tolls for safe passagea suggestion though i think that a few more low sec systems or links should be put in so systems like rancid or amake wouldnt be quite as much linchpins to travel a few low sec systems parallel to them would allow a little more cat and mouse and make counter ganks on pirate gangs or between pirate gangs a bit more feasible without as many jakals concentraded in one system to warp in on others figts not a bad thing just that it can get out of hand and a little tweeaking would help if things got too concentrated
a couple thoughtsi like the single consistent currency of isk for use by concord however i can see a value in having a sort of empire  corporation specific currency for specialized items perhaps the easiest way to implement this would be to make lp a marketable item sort of like tags this could be coupled by expanding the lp shop and adding more ways to acquire lp than just mission grindingim not really sold on why anyone feels empire freighters need to be forced through lowsec in my opinion the whole concord system is a bit broken atm you go from a guaranteed concord death to guaranteed concord leaving you alone at a clearly defined cutoff that divides piracy acts into very limited risk to the pirate to guaranteed suicide you feel empire carebears have it too easy imo the problem is that piracy is entirely too easy but then shuffled off under the rug where only a tiny  of the player base bothers withid do this instead make it really random in 5  7 systems how long it takes till concord shows up essentially it should be possible to gank someone and flee the scene before the cops show up taking a smaller security hit and no concordokkan possible but not guaranteed sometimes concord might show up within seconds and bust the freighter gank concord should also police the remains of any ship blown up frankly scooping loot with a hauler alt right in front of the cops is terrible pvp design
really what purpose is that which major section of the eve population benefits from low sec you need neither balls nor brains you need a frigate or a br singing u cant touch this is optionalanyone with a modicum of sense knows not to take a floating brick through hagilur when the weekend weenies are out
i remember reading somewhere someone suggesting that instead of concord being overzealous cops they need to be peace loving hippies full of passive aggressive attributes where concord didnt show to blow you to pieces but they showed up to rescue the ship under attackit when something like this there should always be a chance for you to kill someone anywhere any time however the higher the sec the more hippies show up to remote repair the ship under attackattacking concord gets the local navy to attack you but if youre setup right and can tank the navy you can kill the navy and the hippy concord and then the target but you have to be fast because the local navy spawns every minute or so and concord hippies spawn every 45 seconds or something if you choose to gank a freighter in a 10 system youre going to have to come at it with more a lot of fire power because the hippies have uber repairing abilities all three to remote hull remote armor remote shieldthe idea was a something about removing secstatus but i cant be bothered to find it old idea ive always thought might be fun on sisi but i dont think itll work in eve people will die all over the place without wardecs because you have 50 battleships camping jita killing everything that undocks even if its empty
done if it does get moved i hope that those of you who support the idea will continue to follow the discussion at assembly hall perhaps we can get one of the csm on board aub
of course you do  consider this caldari and amarr are allies minmatar and gallente are allies each faction has more than one region it makes zero sense to have low sec borders between regions belonging to the same faction and low sec borders between either amarr and caldari or minmatar and gallente if you really want to play the rp card think it througha major change warrants more analysis and thought than an off the cuff suggestion ditch it it doesnt belong hereyes i am painting a broad brush thats all thats needed right now buff mining before you even start to think about buffing trading or pirating
i had suggested something like this awhile back the difference being that there could be a rolling security tide where security status would fluctuate predictably through the week so on some days the empires would be surrounded by only lowsec other days various combinations would be connected and on others it would be as it is nowother possibilities would be utilizing fleet warfare to effect change in security status in some waythough i would certainly support a permanent lowsec around all empires as well
moved by request to the assembly hall from market discussions if you support it please be sure to reply again with a thumbs up
i like the mandatory lowsec to go to different regions as long as 1 there are multiple ways to do it so that its not just a guaranteed gate campgank and 2 there are sufficient economic incentives to bother  ie disparate seed rates for highly used items supply imbalances possible restrictions on market listings in each region etc as long as every route isnt gatecamped and simply an instagank it would provide economic incentive for haulerstraders to venture into lowsec to getdeliver cheaper goodsi also like the idea of putting some risk into ganking people in lowsec by having some kind of chance of a concord response that is variablea big part of the problem with lowsec is the perception that if you go you better be in a fast covop or equivalent or you better have friends because you will get in a fight this could change that and cause a group of 5 to think hard before jumping a solo frig trying to pass through  is it worth possibly losing all 5 ships for that one little frig
obviously i support this idea i certainly hope anyone else will take the time to read through the posts and continue the discussion although i like the idea of the racial currencies if possible id like to drop that topic as it is not directly related to the main thrust of this postcsm reps please take note lets have this brought up aub
this would never happen but i do like the ideaone problem with the idea though you might have people just moving over to one empire and then everybody does their missions there right now this would pretty much be caldari spaceso you could see everyone from the other empires move over to caldari space and the other three empires go bone dryto the pirates that whine about no targets in lowsec it might have something to do with instapopping with 15 bs vs 1 cruiser and scrambling once 3 bs show up to counter 15 bs lay off the targets and just siphon off their profits when you catch them if you make it unprofitable for them to be in lowsec they wont go there anymore simple
voting against the proposal for reasons allready stated within the thread
firstlowsec is an extremely viable casual pvp environment that faction warfare and pirates benefit from explorers go there pos are set up there due to their proximity to empire it is a good place for people to experience a life outside highsec without the drag of bubbles pun intended which poses a tougher challenge i could go on but it is safe to say a large portion of eve players live theresecondmy definitions of balls and brains are relative to the majority of eve players i didnt mean navigate from gate to gate i meant move around in even so if you believe you are perfectly safe going through lowsec in a br or frig you are mistaken its just safer id say covops frigs are 99 untouchable however
i do not support this at allit would buff the most lucrative profession in eve  trading theres no call for thatas far as low sec is concerned tinkering with the tarmac is pointless the whole concept needs a radical overhaul and this isnt itit makes zero sense from a role play angle when you consider carefully the social contextyou make some valid points however i disagree with your claim that a large portion of eve players live there no i havent taken a census have you but all the whines about low sec being emptyunprofitable dont support your claimnowhere is totally safe not even high sec but you have to be incredibly stupid or incredibly unlucky to get ganked passing through
just chiming in with a thumbs up for a gradient of concord responses multiroute lowsec borders thumbs down for multiple currencies
not supported and it make zero sense from an rp point of view you are telling me that some of what would be the most heavily fortified borders in the eve universe are somehow going to be less secure that pirates are going to have a field day in the same area where heavily armed navies would logically congregate to protect their territorymakes absolutely no sense
just putting in my thumbs up since it got moved love the idea of lowsec only routes  and im a traderhauler not a pirate think currencies is a tad silly and not something eve is ready for
look this argument that it makes no sense from an rp point of view is simply wrong heavily fortified borders even if true does not necessarily equate to heavily policed borders in addition who is to say they are heavily fortified you dont just build a fence in spacei can point to real world examples to the extent they are relevant to support my position take for example the united states border with mexico the two countries are friendly if not necessarily allied yet the usmexican border is a lawless zone of terror murder kidnapping drug smuggling human trafficking and gang and cartel warfarethere are other examples in the real world think of the frontier time in us history aka the wild west there are many other examples but for brevitys sake ill let someone else point them out it only makes sense that states will focus their limited resources devoted to policing to secure the hearts of population and commerce and that the fringe territories will be neglectedso this whole notion that concord which is a police force is going to focus its efforts on faraway solar systems that are not very heavily travelled is simply wrongaub
this would be a great change to the game as it matures it would help spread the population out and it would give life to the lowsec border zones fantastic thumbs up
sounds like funexcept the currency part
i agree there needs to be some form of separate of the empires its silly to think i can fly between amarr and rens and not have to go though lowsec combat zoneshowever it does make sense to be able to fly from amarr to jita for example since caldari and amarr are alliesfor that matter you could probably get away with very few highsec links from amarr to gallente space since they are not exactly enemies but not friends either same goes for caldari and minmatar spacethis would make it possible to travel from rens to amarr in highsec but you need to go though caldari space
noyou now simply place the lions share of tradergeneraated wealth in the hands of people who have jump freighters and you isolate a lot of players in a single empire now that there is no safe way of moving between empires there exists no compelling reason for those players to do so  there is besides the belt npcs available mission agents and occasional standings issues very little actual difference between different areas of hisec and in making it harder to get between them you take away the already very small number of reasons for people who dont like lowsec to ever move between them i realise that this will only inspire some people to comment on how the relevant people should learn to like lowsec but you and i both know thats unconstructive and its not going to happen anyway

i agree completely devs not playing their own game is a recurring problem across many mmos i have played
strongly supportedi always wondered if itd be possible to embed devs with large alliances have them actually play along and be shown where the problems are but be monitored regulated and known to be devs
i would finally stop losing my time arguing with them ffs supported caps makes me look cool
word
so your idea is to somehow force the devs to play the game in a mistery time frame between their family time and their work time  like on the time they spent to get from their family to the work 
hey you csms i have a serious ingame gripe why cant i unanchor somebody elses pos to date i have found 2 pos towers that had no forcefield bubble or any other defenses my attempts to unanchor was disallowed no such option kaputis it truly fair that i cannot unanchor a pos that some other corp left without fuel and undefended its a mobile structure after all id be 600 million wealthier or at least have 2 additional towers but noooooo it was launched for this corp and i cant just come along and steal it thatd be like  piracy shucks i kind of wonder what ccp was thinking
it is a source of continued albeit mild annoyance to me that i cant tidy the local system of the offline abandoned faction towers dead corps have left behind them without paying to wardec them and thus blowing these multimillion items up rather than stealing them for profitlets expand on the proposalhow do we handle the mechanics of hostile unanchoring lets create a anchoring disruption unit adu an anchorable module 2500m3 cost circa 100mill which disrupts the control codes in an anchored and offline structure causing it to begin its unanchoring cycleadus take 60 minutes to anchorunanchor 2 minutes to onlineonce online they project a field around them affecting every anchored and offline pos tower within 10km adu field takes 24 hours from the point it goes online to complete an override of the pos anchoring subroutinesthe affected tower will send a notification to the owning corporationthe owning pilotcorporation of the adu gains an aggression flag to the owning pilotscorporations of any affected structuresadus become vulnerable to attack once they are onlineadus can be deployed in any space where objects can be anchoredlistadu requires hacking v and anchoring v to anchor may as well get some more use out of anchoring v beyond t2 large bubbles and being the gateway to pos gunnerypros space garbage collector becomes viable offline space junk can be recycledcons too easytoo complicated to implementcost of adu means small nonfaction towers still nonproit operationthoughtsedited to take account of suggestions so far
nothis is a terrible ideawhy should someone who say cant play the game for a week lose their hardearned investments this way because their pos went offline the mechanic as annoying as it seems sometimes works this way for a reasonif you really want those pos mods or the spot youll have to wardec them and get out your guns just like the rest of usnot supported
how would this be different than if your pos went offline because you werent there for a week and you got wardecced in that time and it was exploded you still lost your hardearned investment it just got blown up instead of stolen or is your contention here that this would make a pos too vulnerable to theft by smaller operators who would not normally be able to muster a large fleet to explode it
sounds reasonablehacking unit adu thingy requires hacking v and has volume 2500 m3 costs around 100 mill with somewhere in the region of 100k ehpyou anchor it next to an offline tower trying to hack an online tower obviously doesnt work and activate it on the offline tower a mail is sent to the pos owner stating that their pos is being hacked the owner or any random passerby has 24 hours to blow up the hacking unit  adu jobby 100k ehp so a couple of minutes of bs fire but not onevolleyable or he can just refuel the pos and online it raising the force field which immediately halts the 24 hour hacking cycle this means that a pos owner will know that his offline pos is being hacked and will easily be able to prevent it if he chooses this ensures that only truly abandoned towers are vulnerable to being hacked and stolenif the 24 hour cycle completes then anyone is free to unanchor the tower if you wander across someone elses hacking unit just as it completes its 24hour cycle on a third partys pos well lucky you
i support this if someone can steal an 80billion ship that was stupidly left unmanned inside of the forcefield of a fully functional pos that someone just blew up then someone should be able to steal a 100600million nonfunctional structure that was stupidly left unfueled or turnedoffit makes perfect sense to me its like how if you dont password lock your cans someone can just come along and take it or they should be able to
supported with the following conditions 1 the structures status must be offline not anchoring unanchoring etc2 hacking requires an anchorable structure someone mentioned this earlier and its a good ideaif your entire corp let it run out of fuel then its your own damned faultkeep in mind a pos is a corporate asset not an individual one the argument that someone would lose their hard earned asset because they couldnt play for a week is hogwash if youre in a corp all by yourself either learn to plan ahead or get some friends to join your corp and share the responsibility
agreed a good ideasoon wh space is just gonna be full of offlined towers as i see many on my travelsthe only problem with a 24hr timer though is its a problem for whs as they tend to close quicker than 24hrs and its hardly worth sticking around for 24hrs just to get that tower
i support this ideawould be cool to be able to use the hacking module or the decoder as well on a pos that has shields up to be able to steal 1 goodie in the hanger or somethingeven be able to hack secure containers left aroundeither way  i like the idea
this could be done but a few balances would be needednamed gripe genuine reutilization of inactive pos entities xdanchored towers only obviously4h anchoring time64h 2d 16h online time in which it can be attackedpos cannot be onlined while the gripe is onliningonlineall modules have to be removed kaboomd or stolen before the tower itself starts to unanchormodules take their normal unanchor time and are automatically queued and unanchored one by onemy two cents hope ye like the name
an intersting proposal i would support this on the condition that the mechanics take into account the cumulative unanchoring times of the modules anchored at the pos and applies a multiplier for example it takes about 56 hours to unanchor all structures at my medium production tower it would be ass backwards if someone can do all that work in an hour or less and would lead to exploits such as using an alt to disrupt the anchored state and saving your self hours of work the mechanic should really be tooled in such a way that it is more geared to cleaning up place holder towers instead of being a griefing tool against somebody whos pos ran out of fuel for 2 hoursremember your looking to steal something that takes quite a bit of work and time to setup why shouldnt you have to put some in aswell
you know what game machnics and game balancing presenting players with totally counter intuitive situations are bad and should be avoided as far as possible also plan ahead if you dont you pay the price and learn to accept the consequences it s simple we already do it in real lifehere are a few gripes i have with immersion breaking game balancing and mechanics1 thread topic unhindered scooping of abandoned poss  all their modules hangars and towers running out of fuel and going offline should render the tower and all associated pos modules unanchored2 tractoring of other players containers and even ships introduce a range of tractor beams with varying strengt and even allow for tractoring of player pods and ships obviously the strength of the tractor beam should determine the mass it could move fit a bigger tractor on a smaller ship and trying to tractor an object with greater mass than your own ship would result in you being pulled towards the heaviner object if you ar the heavier object the lighter object will be pulled towards you simple and straightforward enough3 being able to board a ship even if its being targetted by another ship wtf ccp4 eject pod during warp5 undock in pod if theres no other ship in hangars
if a pos remains unfueled for 24 hours then it should be unanchorable
noi know its a nice idea and i can understand the issuebut that also means all fittings that are outside a forcefield anchored can be stolenlot of people just anchore the batteries and will online them when neededand if tower is blown away the owner still lost the pos but also the thief get nothingwell maybe the bill for ammo so at this point i would say no maybe change if it will be worked out more
this is true but i feel you could work around this by stipulating that either the gripeaduwhatever only effects pos towersand yes in response i should go back and bold the anchored and offline part of my original reply funny how sometimes its someone elses proposal that inspires you in a few dull moments when you should be working isnt it
no fuel for 3 months  unanchorable by anyonereally the only fair solution i think
i would want the following30 days unfueledyou have to declare waryou have to attack the pos to the point where structure is no more then 50 this would destabilize the structurethen you can unanchored it and have to repair it

holy crap im agreeing with shigsy
jesus yes
agreed completely except for the word wrapping p
facepalmtry reading the thread or knowing something about fitting shipsthere is absolutely no way that you can say that a lrar taking up just 70 of a megathrons pg is heavy pg needs when a lst takes up 224 of its cpuas stated balancing lrar pg requirements to the cpu requirements of lsts would involve increasing lrar pg use by about 400 imagine the rage if ccp proposed that but it would be balancedand the cycle is just 45 s and less when overloaded if that cycle was 30 s it might mean something but it isnt
o rly well let me tell you something apparently its news for oyu but damagemods and tracking mods accupy same slots as armor tank and dps  ewar gypsio iii has given page and pages of number that confirm that modules are unbalanced now can you please read them
you forgot the 7th line rrbs are useless without any of the other mods i listed thereand gyps i would not consider the armageddon a good rrbs precisely because it only has 3 mids you see them occasionally however
i guess that seals the deal you havent a clue
lrat does not have heavy pg needsan lrat has far less pg than most bs sized gunslaunchersthis means you can take any solo armor repped bs  remove a gun and fit a lratin the process you will probably gain a large amount of free gridtry the same process on a shield tanked bsan lrst has much more cpu than most bs sized gunslaunchersremove 1 high slot weapon and try to fit a lrst  you wont be able to as youll be short around 80  100 cpu which is a huge amount
giving shield tanked bs more cpu is no solution it is the module not the ship that needs balancingif for example a buddy and me decide to to fly around with a geddon and a raven then its relatively easy to fit lrar on a raven in contrast fitting lst on the geddon will cause major headachesadditionally pls compare chimera and archon or shield vs armor rep fits on nidhoggur and thanatosand then tell us again fitting req are fine
i will not respond to this irrelevant sidediscussion any further as it does not have anything to do with the topic of my proposal i am not here to discuss our rrbs fits and fleet composition its about a module with broken fitting prerequisite thats all if even herschel yamamoto agrees and you are the only one trolling i think everything is clear enough
fyi nid and thanny can shield tank much better than armour and meanwhile they will be better at rr while doing so
its only irrelevant because you refuse to accept any argument but your own thats why he says you havent got a cluesaying dps  ewar is just a prime example of how little you know about pvp thus making any proposal you make ed your not actually prepared to see any point of view but your own so im not sure why you ever made the thread luckily this will never actually make the csms list of things so theres no need to worry about your short sighted ideas breaking anything in the game
ow i am sorry to think that most battleships have guns for shooting at people never knew that armogeddon and typhoon where ewar platforms and good at jamming thought you have other ships like falcons and other recons for that
the scorpion is currently making you look dumbno wait thats your idea
good point all the guns in the world will keep my enemies from warping away or burning back to a gatethe typhoon dominix and megathron make excellent spidertanking ships because they can field extra slots for rr good resistbuffer work prop modspointswebs into their mids and still work out a lot of dpsthe armageddon raven tempest maelstrom make poor spidertanking ships because they can either in the case of the latter 3 fit tank or fit propcap boosterpointweb or in the case of the geddon lack slightly in the mids and let me tell you i dont care how many spider bss you have  if you cant fit resist mods youre going to have troublejust because we use the word ewar doesnt mean were talking about ecm  which should be left to bonused shipson the other hand tracking disrupters extra points extra webs sensor boosters and all the other meh mods that fit in my dominixs extra midslot add a huge amount to its versatilityopen up your eyes and read what is being said for a change
while tracking disruptors are definately nice to have mostly i would rely on ships other then battleships to keep enemy pointed webbed jammed painted and whatever else if you rely excursively on battleships for all ewar in your fleet you are doing it wrong the scorpion is one battleship that does not have lack of midslots excuse me if eight midslots arent enough for you then ccp cant help you either way that does not justify stupid cpu consumption of shield transference module still watiting for reasons why it should consume so much cpu
no just noshield tanks allow for agility passive recharge and maximum dpsgiving shield bs the ability to easily rr would just make armor bs pointless shield rr should stay where it isin the sub bs categorybravo you just killed your own argument in the first post they work differently making them the same in areas where armor should have the lead will just make sp trained in mechanic a waste not supported
i would never fly one of my bs and look for a fight without a dedicated tackler because on anything except another bs i wont be able to catch it before it warps off or it will burn out of pointweb range so if i decide not to fit those modules or god forbid use drones for my ewar purposes in addition to a tackler i still just need the 6 mid slots required by sok to be effective as an active shield tanker i have read all the posts and i am open to all ideas i havent seen a good reason as to why a lst ii costs more cpu to fit then 2 neutron blaster cannon iis or about 2 siege launcher iis or equivalent to about 3 ion blaster cannon iis or 2 425mm rail iis or 3 1400mm howitzer iis or close to 4 800mm ac iis on a side note i dont consider any of the meh ewar mods to be meh a sensor damped logi cant do its job unless it is sit in the middle of the fight neither can an ecm boat a tp helps everyone in the fleet do more damagetarget faster especially the missile spammers a few target dampeners can make any ship miss fwiw all those mods have drone equivalents
i am absolutely shocked and amused there i have sorkatez making 20 post showing how inferior shielnd tancked battleships are and how my proposal still will not make them viable and then i have you and the other guy fly in and complain that shield tanks are overpowered i just dont know what to say any more so i guess i jsut wount say anything no matter what argument i make i get attacked by one of you guys either from shieldtank haters or from the other side dont know what it is even you know what if both sides are complaining that shield buffer tanking is either underpowered or overpowerd probably it is balanced just fix the goddamn shield transfers and we are good
really thats a thing is it like racism or whatsince you fail to make a cohesive argument for your nonsense everyone disagreeing with you is doing it out of an irrational hatred of shields wow the ego knows no bounds
somethings always irked me with the way salvage behaves ingame since nearly all the salvage parts are also available in working versions on the market its like i could just as well smash items in perfect working order on purpose if i want to customize my ship with itso this means im juryrigging my ship with parts that need to have been used in building another ship which is afterwards blown up in cold space to then be usable in the making of ducttape macguyvers for my ride as a way to slightly tweak its capabilities for my specialty  except that these rigs made out of mostly damaged junk can cost several million isk and can sometimes change an attribute by as much as 15right enough venting and down to businessproposal make rigs actual rigs they are made out of junk they tweak the ship a little bit are less effective than stuff made out of legitimate and working parts and require sacrificeshowthe rig system as we know it currently is switched into a customization system same mechanics new fancy name they are intended as deep changes to the ship  too deep for standard modules the difference is that the bom is changed such that the parts are produceable via pi maybe bought on the market and approximate the value of the rigs as they are now its a longterm investment for when you know what your ship is going to dothe salvage parts become used into a new rig system that replicates whats above save that the mods have a reduced effect more can be used on a ship and the drawbacks are greater in proportions they are meant to edge the ship to make it squeeze every last bit of what you want it to do come hell and high doomsday device its shortterm onthefly volatile modifications for the ever changing situations of outer spacedespite my own programming experience im pretty sure im underestimating the work required to make this a reality anyhoo up for discussion do your worst

as if everyone needs another reason to run crap loads of altseve allows you to branch out into multiple fields it being progressively harder to specialize now you would be taking that away forcing people who want to be able to do more than one thing to roll more alts to do itinteresting idea but im going to have to pass on this one

to answer your question tavin if you mean jita corner or some other thread no i havent reposted this idea elsewhere and i hope that reading wouldnt be involved with logic gains and i would hate if it was eve sims i would hope that any exercise to boost an attribute would have the opportunity to be competitive against other players and hold the value of repeating even without attribute gains with the possibility of sporting wagers so each exercise would have to be more of a challenge or puzzle one could do against a few other players those who excel in them against their peers rapidly max out their attribute those who dont perform well still advance but they have to do more challenges to max out even for a poorly skilled player it should not take hours on end to max out a particular attribute but to max them all out would require a decent length of time requiring one to either focus on skills hes needing right now or to make a decision to grind them all up at the same time and hope that he doesnt loose them in a podding event this all works to take away the drawback of attributes being in flux in the first place by allowing you to acquire them more quickly the drawback is also diminished because you can train a skill hopefully while you are also working on your attributes as i hope the instances where training is paused and the new attribute is put in and training restarts would be automatedand not something you have to do manually like when you put in an implant it actually would initially have the potential to be altfriendly because while that alt is noobish and virtually useless it will give the person working on it at least a reason to spend some time on it in stations at least initially then that character would only hazard those attributes points once its actually being used outside the station and only if its podded just as he does with his implants if he has themi dont think i know anyone that gets podded everyday so i dont see a huge drawback in thatmy goal isnt to create a real unthinkableunlivable drawback if its that severe its not worth putting in but just add to the dimensions and depth of the game provide opportunities for increased social interaction and influence slightly certain undesirable playcharacteristics that involve metagaming like cloaking up in deepspace forever logging off everynight there or spending too much time at a pos although i think the pos could have a structure that wouldnt penalize you for logging off there as long as your character boarded that module it would roughly be like docking with a station that doesnt have cloning facilities the real intention of having a random drawback to logging off out of station is to create a cost and consequence for metagaming decisions such as logoffskis and logintrapsand even then not an unthinkable one just an annoyance that would assault those who do it most frequentlybut since learning skills only affect new players and only for a short period of time i can see where my idea would be horrid to many longtime players i just think it would be a more organic method of handling attributes
helloive read through the topics on the first 30 pages of assembly hall and havent found anthing that concerns the remap intervalls cant imagine no one touched this topic beforethe idea of the remap is pretty cool and i like the attribute based learning although charisma is a little overrated p i know that new characters get a couple of free remaps to start with and this is a good thing because it can make initial learning after the 16 mill sp a lot faster for all the other characters a remap is possible every 12 months which is a little too long imhomy suggestion is to shorten the remap intervalls not by a lot but something like half a year or 3 times a year would be very nicefaster learning could be a great benefit for everyone pirate carebear and all the ones inbetween
not supported for one reasoneve is not intended to be a game of instant gratification it rewards patience preplanning and the ability to adapt to the situation at hand
i agree with you but giving people the ability to gain a few extra sph a little more often wouldnt be instant gratification would it especially in the first year of eve it would be a little bit easier for people to compensate for unintended indecisiveness for example if someone started off with a industry focused set of attributes and he realized that he doesnt want to do that anymore for whatever reason it would make things a little easier for him to make up for that it is not a huge increase you get through this you still have to plan carefully but it makes things a little easier eve should also not be a place of displeasure imo
i like the once a year remap however i think getting a free remap when ccp decides to add new skill categories ie pi so that people can remap to bring themselves inline with the new content which they didnt know about when they did the remap
absolutely nothe faster you can alter the attributes the smallr is the difference in characters training speed at some point we may remove attributes altogether and replace them with fixed sph rate
i dont know that its necessary to have this even lets face it if i had been mapped for leadership skills id have been halfway to a pi map anyway or better but if im mapped for leadership and they introduce new gunnery skills wellim just as screwed as the guys mapped for gunnery were when pi hit
ghm while i personally do think that having it half a year would be more reasonable its not exactly an issue
not supportednew characters dont start with a couple of free remaps before remaps existed race and bloodline choices determined your starting attributes now all races and bloodlines start with the same attributes so a new player is given one remap to customize their character which normally would have been done by the racebloodline choiceafter that initial customization the new player has the same 12monthly remap that everyone else getsjust be glad there is a yearly remap
normally i would point this out as an example of falling for a slipperyslope logical falicy however that is pretty much the reason remaps are not shorter with many level 5 skills taking 2 to 6 weeks to train it doesnt take many to fill out a sixmonth skill plan making the remap time significantly shorter would be very close to replacing attributes with a fixed sph learning rate as it is significant planning and sacrifice needs to be made to maximize training working as intended
very often if the eve client loses contact with tranquility the client will start making silent assumptions and keep going as though absolutely nothing were wrong very often this is not desirable behavior because the lack of contact is not due to a temporary hiccup in the data stream but a more serious interruption that would force the player to quitkill the eve client and log in all over again in any event in any event the death penalty in eve online is very high so the player should be made explicitly aware sooner rather than later if the client cant talk to the serveri propose some kind of visual indicator that appears on screen whenever the eve client has gone on without contact from the server for an inordinately long period of time such as 10 seconds an example of the sort of message that should appear isno data packets have been received from server name in the past number seconds what you see on screen is based upon various assumptions made by the client program in the absence of data from server name your commands will have no effect upon the game until contact is reestablishedyou can wait for the client to reestablish contact with the server once contact is reestablished this message will automatically disappear alternatively you may quit the game by clicking the button belowthe default span of time without server contact that causes this message to appear is 10 seconds you may change this in the escape menu
how about it just says connection lost
hah this 
because connection lost is reserved for when the server has asserted that a connection will not be reestablishedasherons call used to have alittle icon that indicated connection status maybe ccp could implement something similar
i miss that game but agreed there needs to be some form of visual cue as to server connectivity
supportedi hate jumping into a system and waiting and waiting and waiting before i finally get a connection lost message and then log back in find myself in the clone vat or even just back in the beltplexmission with no drones
you mean like a little circle lets say next to the evedateclock which tells it by colourgreen  all clearyellow  bad connectionred  connection lost

honestly i hate the idea of ageddon i think the sponsors should be podded and banned i like a lot of the core mechanics of eve as for how ships mining and some of the industrial systems work but the social dynamics of this game blowsanyone with 20 or less that enters high sec should be gate gunned and concorded on sight they are outlaws and do not deserve the survive in high sec they wanted to be pirates well then go be pirates in low sec
010 please try harderobvious fake ragetears doesnt make for good entertainmenttrolling
eh
it is not fake rage i despise pirates and grievers the mass of idiots and bottom feeding ass hats make the few interesting points in the game not worth playing he who has the most time to killwaste and screw with other people wins is not a good game environment the devs that decided that type of game play was a good idea need to be reevaluated
if you think you have the power to reevaluate devs then at least you should have enough guts to post with your main
hello kitty online is that way htfu
lol no dont think so i will bet one thing though if hko was subscription based it would make more money in a month than ccp makes in a year from eve world of warcraft i know does what do these games have in common a defined and ruled pve system in the case of wow there is pvp but not harsh pvp results for loosing does it make pvp and pve a little less meaning full maybe but it depends on what you are trying to get out of itbecause eve is so focues on pvp it will never be a large game yes there may be 300k subscriptions but i bet there are less than 100k actual players the way eve is built it could not survive with 100k  300k actual active players all on at the same timehopefully if the game ever does some how grow to that size and they have to shard the world due to technical issues involved with network traffic the new worlds will have a more aggressively defined rules set for high low and null sec leave the cesspool that is the current live shard as it is the game as a whole is due for a reset anyway
maybe you should just quit
1 the real reason some ppl wont play eve is theyre just like u who need to be told how to have fun instead of actually using your own brain the rules r there cause its not like u can get shot inside a station hint hint2 clearly u just want another wow clone to suit your wow mentality guess what theres something even better than a wow clonethe real thinggo back to wow
i am a miner this idea is stupid and here is whyduring hulkageddon i mine in a retriever i fit it to have a tank because most gankers in hulkageddon dont expect a tanked retriever i have been fail ganked 6 times since this has startedit is all about properly fitting your ship a properly tanked ship can survive some of the best gank attemptsrat
the whole idea of eve is that it is a massive sandbox and not a safe grinding environment because eve is based on becoming more of a scifi simulator and less of a game in the traditional sense ccp has established a set of rules and tools and its up to the players how the world is divided and shaped the people who blow up stuff mostly do it out of competition and having a good timenow hulkageddon is just a fun event in which i planned to participate internet issues ruined this because its a competition which was at first aimed against macromining and eventually evolved into a poking the bear contest mostly due to the rage of losing a virtually worthless itemwhat i ask to you is to come back once youve borrowed a cup of perspective from your neighbour and mull over if this is the game for you
as the title says to stop attacks on players from players that are in a npc corporationswe started brainstorming after a player stole ore out of a can while our alliance member was mining a so called can flipper his corporation members could attack the can flipper but other alliance members couldnt do much to help we wondered why an alliance cant attack the can flipper same thing as the corporation members can at the end an alliance should be able to help their members no matter what corporation he belong to in the alliancebut we asked ourselves more questions in this brainstorming part we believe we came to a good ideanew players that join the game will join at one of the school corporations as happen now in that corporation he cant do anything against other players he cant be attacked as well by players in player created corporations say it will be bored to stay there longer as necessary and hopefully they will join one of the player created corporations maybe its an option to have a steady increasing tax mechanism on them who stay long in the school corporationalso players in non player corporation shouldnt be allowed to attack players in player created corporations and the other waythose ideas should result in that can flippers suicide attacks can be countered by the corporations and alliances those players cant hiding in npc corporations anymore and will lose that protectionif they have negative standing they cant return into an npc for a month after the attackwe are not against those players we like to have them not but its part of this game what we want is that the balance will be more equal so justice can be doneregards
not supported as this will make travelling safe with a hauler alt completely riskless no risk of being suicide gankededit and macro miners like anna pointed out and isk sellers and neutral spy alts for nullsec what i cant attack that carrier that is sitting on my station cos hes in a npc corp and no sorry but that is a really bad ideaalliance aggro is not the worst idea though
not to mention macro miner alts would be even safer as well as any other alt that was created to stay in high sec all the timenot supported
not only is this a solution looking for a problem but it also has some pretty ugly side effects the single biggest effect of this proposal would be to make freighter alts immune to suicide ganking for example terrible idea not supported
errm what cycling characters to avoid security repercussions is a nono so that argument cannot officially be used winkdouble or triple any and all negative standingssecurity adjustments made to characters in the employ of npc corporationsalts the ones that are most certainly not cycled to avoid repercussions  can now only be used once or twice before they are forced out of highsec or the soylent green or is that quafe in eve factoriesthere is absolutely no need to go any further than described make it such a bloody chore to use alts as principal aggressors and a lot of the incidents are no more
reading over the csm minutes which ive never done it occurs to me that low sec should have its own sovereignty levelsedit i see there is another low sec thread up nevertheless this popped out of my head as i read the csm minutes and i think it still stands on its own as it is hopefully a more refined idea that is mentioned as a bullet point in the other threadtldr propose illicit underground criminal network and assets covert stargates stations booster labs etc existing parallel to standard low sec stationsgates offmap not accessable by standard starmaps also propose a parallel sov system not recognized by concord but one allowing usage of said underground networkassets mechanism to claimcontest sov not yet determined discussi would expect the corps that have criminal sov could access these places and perhaps even allow access to other corpsalliances for a fee using the standings system to allow them access via a tollbooth system if theres a fee involvedi would expect there to be some way to hold sov where being a large alliance has no real advantage merely the ability of a corp to subvert criminal organizations in some way this way an outlaw corp can in effect control their turf without needing to be a large alliance perhaps making it so that only an unallied corp can hold sov or perhaps controlling the amount of people that use a stargate or acceleration gate into a deadspace pocket where the outlaw station can be found you would then have to find the gate to gain access for example or have a tag or password to get through the acceleration gate much like existing mission deadspace pockets only these would use player access mechanisms in this way normal read high sec status and noncriminal players people cannot find the station and can only access the gate with the passwordtagthis mechanism could extend to a network of covert stargates which nominally could be spread around to facilitate travel through lowsec similar to the regional gates found throughout nullsec perhaps 510 of these gates could be set up initially assessed for usage and function and updated as needed these gates may perhaps aid in interregional travel trade or logistics cutting a 2030 jump trip into 510 jumps these would not be found on in game starmaps but with the bms and access ticketspassword could be used freely or with a fee as neededin the aforementioned stations you could rent out booster labs research slots etc creating income sources for the criminal player corporation presumably the criminal corp player run would also incur standings loss with concord reinforcing the motivation to stay in and operate out of lowsec
i like the idea of some sort of sov for low sec i was interested in the idea in the csm minutes that greyscale mentionedi think that lowsec should be a criminal area and that this idea has a lot of strong pointsneeds some refining but other then that i like this idearat
this deserves a bump
if the cancelproblem is solved i fully support the idea
if you read the faction warfare part of the meeting minutes you will notice with this quote here that fw is not a priority it should be since new players are immediately sent to fw almost after the tutorial this alone should be enough to get high enough priority so they could work on making fw a better placesure theres lots of things to work on but fw should get a higher priority since its a bridge between highsec and null sec people for now the attention is with incarna and dust 514 since incarna is only a socializing tool and some mini game inside i believe that a fresh workout on faction warfare should have a greater impact on the pvp community
i think i remember this storyits the whole socialistic crap about how people that have overachieved should give their stuff to the underachiever simply because its the right thing to do right thats pretty much it but since crying to ccp to change the game from free will to forced singular ideals of only small warfare instead of both large and small time for plan bcreate a massive super alliance to smash the other three use isk to create internal disorder cause you know isk talks hence why the power blocks exist to begin with they create more iskies for peopleso we have ultimately just end up with the three vs one pretty much equating into just two huge power blocks yeah thats really fixing things isnt it and even if successful people will band back together and reform new power blocks againbecause that is where the isk is at power and isk there are plenty of options for smaller warfare fw wh npc space even empire space id equate to small warfare for people to do im all for adding more to create a more dynamic game not remove aspects thoso why remove the option to partcipate in large scale worldly might if people want to do so eh socialistic agenda to make everything fair n equal is only thing i can imagine someone cant have the moon heshe wants cause somsone else has more to hold it with so they got to cry about it and convince others his way is the right way to think kinda really weak or some butthurt indivual is reflecting too much on the past and is trying to right a wrong
i agree with the opthe simple fact is the current system is only good for people who established themselves years ago all of the newer alliances and players get a raw deal ive said it before standings should be removed it would make fighting on grid with friendlies pretty damn difficult i agree its in peoples nature to work together i get that and its fine however the nap mentality of today bypasses alot of the issues these gigantic coalitions should be facing if you took the entire northern or southern coalition and bundled them up into one alliance each i guarentee they would crumble within days by having lots of smaller alliances you eliminate all the major issues that should come with having a massive empire in any alliance there is a small number of people in charge the larger that alliance the more difficult it is to control and get a consensus more than that logistics is made infinitely more difficult and complex with more members you get more corporations and the more corporations the more ceos and the more ceos the more opinionsas it is now in alliances none of these are issues because you have the stronger established alliances at the top guiding the weaker newer alliances at the bottom and if they dont take what is given to them then theyre reset and someone else who will abide by the rules is brought inits all about the selling point of the game this is a great game and i wont quit regardless of what happens however what ccp advertise is not what you get they speak of large epic battles and space conquest when in reality pretty much no space is shifting hands anymore everyone likes the idea of a war and i think most 00 dwellers enjoy a good fight as it is now you have alliances making hundreds of billions to trillions a year so much isk that they could lose dozens if not hundreds of capital fleets a year and keep on smiling  thats a broken game because it means it is nigh on impossible for others to break them or get established if people want to group up i think they should do so under one alliance banner because that is what alliances were originally made for alliances of today are now just the corporations of yesterday if you were not around in 0405 then you probably wont understand but are there really any who were around back then who think the game is more enjoyable now than it was then
all the talk about about social and psychological behavior isk wealth etc made me remember that there are actually lots of people making a living from online games and they are interested to keep a prosperous stable and peaceful 00 status quo in evesince rl income  any game i can no longer support your proposal m8 sorry
support 4 hydraoh waitbut seriously dude you cant complain that someone holds space if an alliance goes so big claims and holds their space and doesnt fall apart after this many years props to themidk why u whine bout space ull never claim it so its like complainin bout colors not changing on the influence map
you really believe what you just typedyoure saying people that have been around longer should not be entitled to things they have earned to younger people strange imagine shoe on other foot thenbolded the really funny part for people because ya sure it isnt fair at all that the stronger established people have more power than the weaker sorry working as intended why should that be different exactlyif someone is stronger they will become established and grow if someone is weaker they will fall apart its happened alliances have crawled back from near nonexistence and they have earned what they got now and some have lost a great deal and have become a memory
you obviously dont understand my post and resort to trollingread it again im saying atm its near impossible for newer alliances to get power and weaker alliances to become stronger its been the same now for years the same people in the same areas mostly not down to their own work but rather the work of in some cases dozens of other alliances most of which pets who never seem to break the pet mould and just fizzle away and die before being replaced the people are the same just in some cases the names have changed what im saying is really that coalitions should be forced to be under one banner and one name because the current system bypasses alot of the hassle that would arise if they were all under one banner or in one alliance i honestly couldnt care less who owns what now my interest in space has long gone but its boring im not imposing my ideas on anyone im saying what i think and im using my memory to remember what it was like it was far more enjoyableim not saying im right im saying what i beleive would improve the game some other suggestions also warrant a look at and are perhaps alot less controversial such as making people pay large sums of isk for standingsholding space anywho troll away
i understand your point just fine and perhaps you should understand what internet trolling means exactly before using it in a sentence pot call kettle black ive stated my point you stated yours i pointed out the illogical reason in yours imo and then you hurl an insult at me instead of actually debating my points bravoso who exactly is going to charge these alliances for holding empty lawless uncontroled space as it stands now and imo should is the alliance charges corps to hold space or get forcefully kicked outempire its not empire space but if they did that id be all for it if they are allowed to fight and take control of empire space in return for them taking over player space and if people are having to pay for space more so than they do now doesnt that infact make it harder for newer startup corpsalliances to get a foot hold in null why yes it doesim all for implementingadjusting things but it should be fair to everyone shouldnt spank older players that have achieved their goals over newer people that are trying to gain the same status simply because they have more that sounds so ridiculously unfair than how it stands now why dont we impose a higher tax on players that say have x billions in isk cause they can manipulate the market make more items buy more goodies than a younger player is it really fair to penalize older players that have achieved more this whole idea stinks of the same skunk brew
im still kind of confused as to why this thread is in the assembly hall
o7this is a small issue i have but it annoys the hell out of me and it would make life for everyone in fleets way easier i have searched the forums for a bit but did not find any proposal for this so i am making a new thread if there is already one about this please pass me a link and lock this topiccurrent situationsomeone in your fleet is getting shot you are the logistics pilot he broadcasts for reps you have to rightclick his broadcast and select lock target or something like that accidentally you hit show info the info box pops up you need to close it have to find the broadcast in the log because someone broadcasted a new target you hit lock target get a lock and in the same moment the target pops because you could not rep it in timegreatbasic fixallow targets from broadcasts to be locked like targets in overview ctrl  click on the broadcast  target gets locked afaik its not possible at the moment small improvement but it would really help many playersthis would obviously work for all targeted broadcasts reps  targetadvanced version could bewhile were at itctrl  click on align toorder align to the objectctrl  click on cyno broadcast jump to cyno if you are in a capable shipyou get the ideaany opinions again if it has already been proposed sorryiltarus

how about this for a way for the player base and the csm to keep up to date on the plans of ccp update the eve websitei havent gone on to the drawlingbroad or in development page in a good bit but after reading the time notes from the csm i thought well lets see what ccp is up to what do i seeseptember 4th 2008 omg you have to be kidding me no one from ccp is updating this as items on the list are being implemented or just down right dropped no wonder the fan base has no idea what is going on and the csm is having such a hard time showing the players that they are making a differencei am not saying that ccp should be holding our hand and showing all the cards they hold but almost 2 years and not one thing has changed on the two pages under drawlingbroad there is a thing sayingplanetary governorthe probable first step for planetary interaction where you can manage planets from a station or other suitable structurewell no much of a governor but i think this is now post drawlingbroad and into post production if this is what you had planed or in development for the next patchplease talk to your player base ccp keep us up to date on your plans and what is going to take a bit update your pages and the csm wouldnt have sure a hard time and it may make it easier on them because the players will know what is going on
no i like my 1261 units of water dropping from npc freighters i have to gank in lvl5s its not worth diddly  but is a funny thing to get in loot i just use that as an example many pi items can be acquired from npc haulers and structures but really its a good thing i dont think they come in significant enough quantities to seriously impact market value i for one dont even sell it i just toss it in my funny  can i have in my home station thus stupid amounts of water oxygen and rocket fuel get tossed in with the exotic dancers spies and flower power powder
yes water drop maybe not significant but planetry vehicles will never be worth building since entire supply can be produced by running severals of those missions  for all eve unless pv are required for t2 production somewhere along the line that i missed it and its demand is greater 
only drop lowtier stuff planetary vehicles are actually highend good and should not be dropping in tousands dropping biomass in thousands sure blood raiders anyone
too easy to answeror at least i have my suspicions
now that is lulz but yeah im waiting for my sub to run out and i was kinda hoping to get my first forum ban before that not having much luck so far though guess ill just have to troll harder but yeah ive kinda lost interest in eve and the minutes from the last csm summit was kinda like the final nail in the coffin maybe now that ive openly admitted to trolling i can get that forum ban
a mistake that should be fixed
1 this is an excellent idea i was thinking this myself i just didnt think to post it hereanother thing to add would be javascript so that it doesnt have to reload the entire page in order to update the broadcasts
supportedan xmpp gateway would be serious win
i was reading and interested until i realized you were talking about ims and not something cooler but thats what i get for doing bong rips before hand anyways cool idea
supported market expansion
role playing huh i have heard of this sounds sort of fun makeing stuff up thats not actually ingame not to be negative or anything i like to imagine myself as a merc on my main doing missions and rating in lowsec or try pvp and get my ass kick even though i had 13 million sp but then i realize im constantly looking at this fraking ship and a pic of my face with a ton of ppl i cant trust and no ship to last more than 30 secs or a day if i decide to hunt pirates i like to play alone solo pvp is deadon top of this this role playing articles and of course the awsome eve chronicles are just a big tease to me the player cant do 89 of the things in those awsome writeings then there is the shinny videos they always put out where the game is nothing like those videosim just saying i gess all this writeing ccp has done could have been put into the game i read a n article of a station haveing an explosion i dont think they gave the location of the station but if they did im pretty sure nothing actully happened ingamei know intersteller reports what happens in game to playerscorperations which is sweet i read it sometimes so that said scope and eve chronicles are a fraking tease to me when i read them all it does is make me wish i can do it ingame stop teaseing us ccp
to report on the daily enmass crashing happening
are you referring to malkalen v  moon 1  ishukone corporation factory its currently burning quite nicely and i am unaware of any other possible station that may have had similar misfortune
thats typical ccp though  start something never finish it i mean what the heck are the station managers doing buying oxygen so they can feed the fires its been years
we want to know how it was all done so that we can get rid of the rest of the csm by the same methodsomeone out there who is not currently in the csm as they know but for obvious reasons wont tell  must know what the secret ismaybe it was her membership with a certain political party in her home country that advocates a method of software distribution that is anathema to ccp and other development houses this was i suspect the main reason for it  which begs the question  if we send the other csm members application forms for that group will they all be booted or maybe we just sign them up anyway 
im going to stop you right there to point out that ive already seen at least one huffy post here or on massively from someone who claimed to be in the uk branch of the piratpartiet who apparently stated that eva jobse was pretty much on her own and that they didnt support whatever shed done to breach the nda  that they support copyright they just want to make the copyright system fairer for consumersim jumping on you because i doubt ccp would appreciate any sort of rumor that they canned her for rl political reasons  that sort of thing is anathema to almost everyone
funny i thought that by expelling her ccp would have enough proof to say shes guilty
im surprised ccp published any reason for eva jobses removal from the csm ccp are more than likely not obliged to i would have expected to have seen eva has decided to leave her position on the csm due to commitment issues
i feel a degree of sympathy for eva i can see the effort and passion she felt for the game but that is as far as it goes this little event isnt a russian tragedy worthy of lamenting the cross over whatever the facts they are beyond us and buried in red tape we cant cut so even i can see that there is only one important and practical question left in the spirit of eveher stuff can i haz
good point i have to say that if it was unfounded wouldnt we see her making alot of noise about it seems strange that she is so quiet about the hole thing her blog on take care said she would post something tomorrow wasnt that a day or two ago and still nothing
18 pages of guff who cares shes out of there
aye blizzaed get a 2000 page thread and into the main news eve gets a csm delgate relieved of her dutysviral marketing blizzerd 1 eve 0
by now nearly a week the kick got published on the july 7th
its the csm who gives a 
thats actually a great document to have because i can look at it every time i ask myself if something is coming up in eve that i actually care for like spaceships and things that happen in space obviously not good riddance
the minutes were a nice read although i found this a little dissapointingi guess i can live with small fixes
its their game and they can do whatever they please end game for them is that whatever brings the  through the door is a win for them tbqh if they wish to make it pretty ponies in space and it brings in the punters in droves  who are we to stop themdont know what deceptive stats you are talking about  they wouldnt be the ones that reflect revenue coming into ccp would it i mean how deceptive can money in the bank be  or do you want them to do it all for free to satisfy the in crowd you know that if you try really hard the cool kids might let you into 00 to play with them a couple more suck up posts may do it
tee hee heeccp stated that it decided not to react hastily once the issue was discovered because it deemed that the potential damage was limited enough to warrant waiting for a full and wellthoughtout solutionthe solution was nothingthat was their full and wellthoughtout solutiongoes to show
all emphasis mineseriously he offered a purely hypothetical conjecture and a nonsequitur at that in reply meeting notes can never capture the nuance of such a charged discussioni understand pride in ones work and that dissonance may occur when confronted with strong criticism but it is an important part of a leaders job to listen well heres to hoping that some reflection follows even if it wasnt obvious in the moment
well of course they can do what they want its their game but that doesnt mean that you need to encourage them to do stupid things yeah they can make it into a unicorn simulator but they shouldnt and they wont its going to be a spaceship game featuring nonconsensual pvp forever  whatever changes itll still be eve i want this game to be the best eve it can be and for that matter i think and hope that ccp does too so while they could sabotage it lets just ignore that as the silly rhetorical ploy that we both know it to be regarding deceptive stats im not ccps accountant i dont know their cash flows but i do know that bragging about how much money you spend on game development is a hollow and meaningless number when you dont get anything for the money its an old maxim that anyone who cant measure output will measure input instead and it seems to be as true of ccp management as it is of a government employees union at contract time and lets not even get into how deceptive the new shiny sells better than bug fixes stat is  neglecting reputation effects seems like a brilliant strategy for a product whose longterm health is essential to your companys continued existence doesnt it and please ive already done more than enough sucking up i have it on good authority that dierdra vaals alliance will take me any time i want to join and i already have an alt in ankhesentapemkahs corp
bitter ccp exec alt is bitterifly
then id suggest your job should you be interested in getting things done is to figure out what information source management is relying on since its apparently not the csm andor their own devs
honestly i reported the op for trolling this is so depressing i barely have words for it id love to see ccp and eve succeed  ive certainly put enough effort into making the game a better place but ccp execsdevs im not sure which honestly and the minutes arent descriptive enough for me to know which seem hell bound determined to drive eve into the groundits very simple we pay for internet spaceships  and ccp should feel free to devote resources to making other games and bringing other cool visions to pass but dammit there are an enormous number of small things which could be done to massively improve the game im so tempted to offer to work for free if theyll just let me fix the  theyre leaving to rotlow sec  broken content failfleet lag  broken content failcosmos  broken content failfaction warfare  broken content failthe ui  broken content failccp  broken company faildammit so much investedliang
this is something id be interested in finding out who does the strategizing at ccp that decided that it would be a good idea to essentially loot the eve brand by extracting money from it without reinvesting in the game putting all the resources into two other games that dont have nearly the proven solid reliable and most of all existing customer base that eve has the amount of total accounts created nowadays increases somewhat exponentially while the amount of active subscribers increases at a linear pace and with ccp owning half the advertising real estate on the internet currently this cant be a good sign for the long term future of eve and this is only from public information gleamed from various sources and nothing to do with my csm alt status they dont tell the alts  anyways god knows what the private information would tell us
what that says to me is according to their data new customers income due to flashy expansions can make them more money than retention of current customers through promised commitment to excellencetm even if i try to play devils advocate its hard to take anything else away from thatresources committed  results you know youre on shaky ground when someone is quick to tell you how hard theyve worked but not so quick to share their tangible resultsi dont include this because the reality of a business needing to please shareholders and turn a profit eludes mehowever this in conjunction with the other two paint a picture i dont think truly serves either ccp nor the players long term interests management habits as companies grow larger can become frightful the more successful and older a company gets the more you get people coming in offering the world gambling big and failing they focus on maximum profit and if the ship sinks they move on if the powers that be at ccp abandon their past ways of showing a commitment to excellence and trade that in for a commitment to excellencetm well youll find quickly that empty promises and continued guarantees for its going to get better we promise is all youll receive regardless of best intentions by devswhile new product and new customers may show quicker immediate returns doing this at the cost of a strong will to retain customers scraping quality for quantity and a working ability to make good on promises to customers is comparable to trying to build a structure ever faster ever taller and ignoring the crumbling foundationi really do care about eve but youd have to be blind to see the cognitive dissonance between their game development assurancespromisesintentions and their blatant and self admitted full steam ahead new product business direction
it would probably tell you something like the average mmo gamer including eve plays any 1 game for between 19 and 22 months before they burn out and leave regardless of how polished the game isevery 100 spent on new features will attract 10 new or returning players of which 2 will hang around past 4 weeks for a full 1922 month cycleevery 100 spent on advertising will attract 20 new players of which 5 will hang around past 4 weeks for a full 1922 month cycleevery 100 spent on polish will attract 2 new players neither of whom will stay statistically and will have a negligible effect on extending the 1922 month cycle which is set by burn out factors unrelated to game polish or features thatd be my guess 
well reading all that was a gigantic waste of timeccp incarna better be off the chain since everything gets put on the back burner for it
those statistics seem very flawed and presume a functioning game with a nontoxic player community to start with mmo history is littered with the corpses of mmos that lived by this mantra sto who swg etcliang

i obviously made up the specifics but i think thats the general belief prevailing in mmo management at this timetake a look at this year old interview with the directors of bohemoth bioware as an example 
the take away there doesnt support the comment though it supports the comment that polish is the most important thing in an mmoand ccp is sacrificing thatliang
yep and im looking at your account with my finger poised over the ban button stupid poaster is stupid oh and shiney stuff ftw no one cares about the 00 denizens they contribute a small percentage to the game costs a small percentage to the game environment out of sight and out of mind to 95 of the player base yet they make up the majority of the whining and forum wastage look at the ongoing disaster of the majority 00 run csm  irrelevance is their motto selfindulgence is their rationale and failure is their aim
the latent psychological issues in this guy are just straight comedy thank youso you are a high sec carebear that gets owned during hulkageddon but you applied for csm and were promptly denied for your lack of intelligence tact wit ingenuity or communicability explained much is
the problem is mmo managers are reliant on statistics that only represent the short term and are making assumptions that simply arent justifiable i mean seriously does anyone think that wow has had ten million subscribers for the last three years because they advertise better that doesnt even pass the laugh test its the most popular because a blizzard polishes their games until they sparkle and b blizzard has a reputation for polishing their games until they sparkle its the same as every other mmo but better and it has thirty times their subscriber counts because of its quality ccp on the other hand makes code that most garage programmers wouldnt pass through qa and has made it to 2 based on a unique user experience thats great of course and its why i play but it is just a completely different entrant into the market and yet they try to market themselves like any other mmo they try to run the game like any other mmo and they plan for customer retention like any other mmo then they wonder why they have a lower retention rate than most flash games if youre going to be unique  and thats what ccp was founded on  then you have to act it you dont advertise to the wow players of the world because they wont put up with your crap anyone who plays wow for the quality of design wont finish their eve trial period anyone who plays wow for a nice stressfree grindfest will quit eve the first time they lose a ship to hulkageddon you find the players who want what you make and you cherish them because theyre not a common resource if you  off the pvplovers once you have no fallback market wow can churn users but eve cant which is really ironic given their respective attitudes towards ing on their existing customers i dont deny that the conventional wisdom at ccp is an accurate representation of the shortrun state of affairs but reputation and word of mouth matter and theyre just ignoring that in favour of their firstapproximation data on user acquisition from new features i have nothing against new features but i do have something against ccps nearpathological aversion to fixing past broken content dominion sov and some balance changes arent nearly enough to fix the state of this game and until that changes eve will have a reputation for being buggy incomplete and not living up to anything like its potential ccp needs to spend less effort trying to attract more people who will never play eve for any length of time and more effort trying to get those of us who want to like it to keep playing well advertise for you if you give us something we can tell our friends about without shame
they probably are worse for eve everyone is annoyed about them adding new stuff but the player community needs to realize that eve specifically drives more people off than comparable games part of it is the poor ui and learning curve part of it is the community being toxic and part of it is the pvp focus i think if the community had a better attitude and stopped focusing so much on htfu and tears you might see a lot more player retention the other two cant change but a lot of eves bad rep is due to us too the best way to keep people in is to invest in them i mean this has to be one of the only games ive played where the community delights in running certain types of players out of the game rather than try and integrate them and help them deal with the pvp focus
nice try csm i fully understand how much thought and effort you have put into this attempt now all we have to doas players is get them to listen to what you have to say
id love to know where the management is getting their statistical data from and how they verified that it was applicable to a persistent mmo like eve i sure hope they dont use data from single release games because those are not comparablesingle games are throw away products fire and forget release on the market and make a new one if popular make sequel or expansion but a mmo like eve does not forget the old releases theyre still around and pile up and if theyre less than excellent they form a huge junkyard of not quite finished features where the lone new content is slapped onevery expansion and every new feature for a persistent mmo needs to fit in seamlessly into the whole game and form a new or expanded single game with many features every intended game style needs to be deep enough that a player can fully immerse oneself in it failure to do so will result in people hopping from feature to feature only to realize how quickly they get bored of them burn out quit and never come backthink of all the old classics people still play after 10 or more years these are games that have reached a level of excellence that makes people replay it even if the technology in them is old the game design isntkeeping players playing is essential for a healthy and reliable player base resulting in a high resistance to revenue loss at the appearance of rival products and a low risk environment for investments with the design strategy ccp is currently running they are increasing the risk of a total product failure the mmo market is no place to become complacent
thing is this game was literally created for the purpose of harvesting tears a bunch of dudes from iceland got annoyed that they couldnt grief in ultima online and decided to make their own game where griefing was encouraged if eve loses that all itd be left with is a decent market simulator and a thirdrate pve experience run through the worst ui in a major release this decade eve has to acquire and retain new players with that as a constraint its not something that can be set aside
to the csm members have you consider resigningthank for the hard work btw too bad 90 not heard by ccp for the 5th timeold players use plex plex comes from new players who want iskhence ccp needs new playerswith that said it still a joke at how they just say well we wont fix anything cause we are busy with other cool broken stuffi saw we all take our spaceships to eve gate and mass destruct to show our disappointmentat the moment i feel like ccp saying you dont pay for expansion so stfu and deal with the bugs they bring
is this video available to the public
i dont know if its public it was a morsus mihi video on how to deal with lag it doesnt really contain anything shocking or super secret which is why its surprising that ccp didnt seem to be aware of all of it
hmmm could this be the arena stuff that was rejected by the cluster beforeif so i need more popcorn waaay more popcorn
uploaded it here
thanks may i suggest evefilescom as well no nagscreensstupid popups and automatic torrent 
after reading the report and seeing ccp plans about no changes on the actual fw mechanics for at least one and a half year generally not changing any of the other brokenunbalancing issues incarna  no i dont need another glorified chat window i like spaceship games dust  why should i support a game in which i wont play but affects the game i do play on is really beyond me its obvious to me the ccp just want my money to do things i am not really intrested oni decided to stop my alt accounts my main will remain for the time been as i do have personal friends in the gamebut even that might not last longgreat work by the csm as they did show us how player friendly ccp is really like
im not saying for the gameplay to change focus or strip the pvp elements from the game its more that players can make it a lot worse and drive people from the game by their attitudes towards others you can still have pvp without a griefing mindset even open world pvp if you dont want them to add fluff instead of meaningful changes help retain people you are not going to do that by acting like a tool each time someone dies in a barge in hulkageddon or constantly htfuing
i just reactivated my account on the 5 day offer wont be subscribing beyond that though im not going to bother downloading the new clientlooking at the forums it seems that my reasons for originally unsubscribing my two accounts are vindicatedi started my first account in 2006 then added a second in 2007 i lapsed both of them at the end of 2008 when it seemed clear that ccp had abandoned many of the things i was enthusiastic aboutin the time between early 2006 and late 2008 i had spent around UFFFD450 on eve was it worth that much money well no  there were some big quality of service issues and the new features like faction warfare had been released halfbaked and then never followed up lag was terrible even in relatively small fights i kept paying because i had faith that ccp would sort it outessentially i was paying because i was investing in what eve was going to be there were problems but they would eventually be sorted outi lost faith i thought that ccp were just using eve as a cash generator to finance other projects they also rewrote history to suit their changing policies faction warfare was supposed to be an ongoing development  a bit pointless to begin with but later things would be epic that changed to faction warfare is just for newbies to get their feet wet before joining a 00 alliance working as intended no more development in the pipelinecrippling lag was always on the verge of being conquered for good we are at war with eurasia we have always been at war with eurasianow i see that there will be very little development on eve until 2011 but theyre always lateso with all the problems that caused me to lose faith in the first place still very much in evidence why would i pay another UFFFD350 on a very vague promise that all will eventually be wellif i hadnt unsubscribed in 2008 i would have spent around UFFFD700 by now i can buy a lot of games for UFFFD700how many of you have kept the faith and kept paying because whilst you might have been less than happy with eve as it is now you trusted that eve would be something epic soon how much have you investedthe infuriating part for me is that eve could be great eve could be so good that id be prepared to sign up for ten years but with ccp at the helm it wont be it wont be everyoure paying a lot of money for a subpar product it wont change until at least 2011 and realistically it wont change at all
i dont think we really disagree im just saying that between the brutality inherent in the games design and the level of community decay inherent in any large group of gamers i dont expect better i try not to be a jerk towards people who are new to the game and dont get eve but expecting the entire forum community to be decent reasonable folks is like expecting world peace to break out after woodstock
pvp in eve is generally good better than any other game out there the problem is that the giant battles the crowning moments of glory fall flat on their face currentlypve in eve is not so good better than it used to be but still lacking honestly i think part of what it is lacking is real boss fights there arent any true boss characters in pve a boss always does something different than the other npcs it isnt just another character with more tank and more dps it uses different weapons has special weapons and has a higher functioning ai so it responds to the character more than the chargenshoot of the rest of the npcssov both 00 and faction is less painful than the pos warfare of old but still is lackingpi just sucksccp is able to float by on these things but not for terribly long definitely not another year without showing some interest in fixing things
the sad thing is you missed the 6 month interval last year when lag was pretty much fixed and things were generally awesome look at the forums this time last year  we were much happier
indeed if ccp get eve sorted out ill be delighted to play again i just cant bring myself to financially contribute to ccp if theyre not properly committed to their product
23 years ago i used to rave about this game to anyone who would listen now i dont even mention itccp remember a happy customer tells 35 people about a good experience an unhappy customer tells 100s about their bad experience
players will be required when the new character creator will be released to recreate all avatars in the new system ccp will probably continue to provide the paid service of remaking avatars csm requested that ccp take measures to compensate charges imposed for old style portrait swaps that occur within a reasonable timeframe prior to the release of the new character creator as it didnt seem fair to charge people for something that would be negated by the new avatar requirementsthis is when i quit  i dont care about a new avatar how does it help me in the game it doesnt do anything of any benifit to anyone  will new subscriptions when this is introduced pay for their character creation or is a money making excersice to fleece more money out of an already disgruntled existing player base
uh ok look theres plenty to be discontented about but this really does seem a pretty trivial thing to get worked up about
i dont think you have anything to worry aboutto me it looks like this is a precursor to incarna you are asked to redesign your avatar because theyll be redesigning it for that system and possibly generating it from your eve avatar rather than having you make it completely from scratchthe charging thing is just saying they wont be charging people within a short timeframe when this change goes live in case they miss the update notes and pay to change it when they could just wait a day or twotheres no charge to remake it when the update goes live i think so you are probably misreading what this means
man i hate to be able tell you i told you so     remember when everyone was saying its a different group of devs ccp isnt using all their resources on incarnadust  those are different dev groupsi love internet spaceshipsdramafreeform game style but not this crapthis just feels likecsm we would like to look at features x y and z and see where you stand on fixing or iterating them as you told us you would do when you released them to usccp lolcsm whatccp lol stfu n00bs htfucsm to ccpthis is the best internet spaceships game going at the moment there is no guarantee that it will continue to be especially with your attitude i dont hate to break it to you but incarna and dust are not relevant to your core subscriber base personally without any player interaction planned more than what 2nd life would deliver why the f88k would anyone botherto quote malcanis again
you are confusing things a bit dust and incarna are very seperate entities dust is a product outside of eve online and being developed from a seperate developer group in china incarna is a future eve online feature and is being developed by the eve developers for that reasonas far as i remember and i might aswell be wrong ccp never claimed that the devteam working on the incarna feature were outside of the eve development team
as dv said its pretty obvious that players cant credibly threaten to quit en masseit might be credible though for people to boycott for a single month say something like december when people have holidaysexamsgeneral rl stuff i like the game im not gonna pretend that im gonna quit immediately over their broken content development strategy tho my interest is waning but ive got three accounts and if i thought cancelling them all for a month along with a suitable number of other people would get them to listen id do it id think of it as training excellence to level 5 its a rank 7 skill
i just want to go on record with a bet that ccp will continue to clean up pi in order for it to function properly and in a way that goes well with dust ccp will then say see we fix old content expansion
wtf is that i mean how is it justifiededit 0k something constructive quoting myself hereit doesnt take that long to figure out what is needed and fix it at least in some points surely we dont expect to get stuff of incarnas level but you can always start with basics boost mission lp payouts boost belt rats and anomalies boost ores this alone will cause a great happiness among lowsec dwellers
all you guys are so selfish the players always whine but ccp tries its hardest to keep everybody happy and they have a clear view of their prioritieeaahaha im just screwing with you theyve got their heads up their assits going to be a long couple of years
these minutes are a fine example of basic economicswhen you possess a monopoly on the supply of a product in this case internet spaceship mmos you are allowed to do as you please without risking significant changes in the level of demand youre faced withone can only hope another internet spaceship mmo of sufficient quality makes an appearance on the market soon if only to give ccp the kick in the ass they so sorely require
dust 514 what a joke a shooter that will be played for a few weeks then never played again ccp expects a fly by night consle game to be a permanent feature of eve online i dont think so
im amazed at how little player reaction is to this scandalous results ok maybe the economists and marketing people are telling them that 100 invested in new features and commercials gives them far more customers than fixing crippling bugs and issues but even if that was true if they abandon eve for 18 months which they wont they wont fix anything but they will shove in new features that no one wants and will also be abandoned and broken that eve is dying joke might stop being a jokeand what other mmos does that 100 invested there does that analysis from pretty much polished and bug free wow where any major bug is fixed in a couple of months at worst i dont think all that talk about how much money invested into new shines and commercials you need to retain customers over 1822 month period can come from all the other mmos that died in fire long before they were a year and a half oldi honestly believe that lifycycle of eve player is much longer than average generic mmo simply because you need first 69 months of skill learning to get into most basic stuff and if someone has been stubborn to keep in game that long he wont quite in next 610 months and second eve spreads a lot by word of mouthif ccp stays true to their word and abandons eve for next 18 months it will be horrible if they continue piling new features without fixing anything it will be much worse as 18 months from now we will have several new features that need dev attention and that have introduced dozens of new bugs and performance issues upon serverswhile we as eve players cant influence ccp a least bit about dust as its separate game for a completely different platform we must take a strong voice and demand incarna do be delayed indefinitely until at least some of current major issues with eve are fixedlowsec situation was iffy for years and new probing system was pretty much a nail in the coffin fw was bugged and broken from the start it has been 2 years now and ccp tells us we need to wait at least 2 more for anything to be fixed there 
did you even read the minutes
yes i haveand in them i read that ccp rejected every csm proposal and dismissed every csm concern that they said that they will do no work on lowsec or fw in next 18 moths that ui change is too difficult and also cant be done in that timeframe that even ccp forming a small team that will fix a minor bug or two every moths is impossible with ccps allocation of resources until incarna and dust are shipped
did you where exactly are you disagreeing with him
it must have been a tense affair once the csm heard that the next 18 months or so of dev time is already accounted for it could very well mean that csm 5 and 6 achieve nothing but making ccp aware of things they already know about and have already decided on whether to ignore it develop it or scrap it altogether and of course the time line on which it all happensif it wasnt tense i would feel done in from that comment alone no matter how much time energy and valid points the csm brings to the table it wont change ccps attitude and their agenda less than 10 of accounts voted in the csm 5 project if it stands true of not fixing the fixable in the next twothree updates that figure will be actually lower assuming the account numbers are relativeend of whinenow for the good bit the positivewhat should csm 5 be focusing on this termcsm 5 has to focus on bringing ccp to task on its commitment of excellence programme and ensuring the dev blogs and action points are completed why there are more action points that the csm has to carry out im not sure of but of course they should be done in as timely a matter as possibleto save time at the meetings dont discuss any game mechanic changes for the rest of the year its evident that ccp has their own schedule and the csm didnt get a look in rather bring them an overview of what the players believe the csm should be and how it can obtain its own sprint team for backlog issues and future items that can bring measurable items within the csm cyle or of course 6 months in to the csm afterwith the backlog as big as it is please dont let ccp forget to provide all that you asked for in terms of accountability and progress updatestldr  if you play eve you should be used to reading long passages of text or do you grind missions for the isklpstandingsloot
get your facts straight
1267 voted ok that is over 10 a little
word now is that 3rd party forums discussing this topic such as shc are blocked for employees on the ccp premises
did you really fall for that  haha nice
isnt scrapheap owned by a ccp dev
nope but you just fell for my trap quite well we know who you are now
hello employee time to reskin and learn a thing or two about entrapments p
look at it this way  ccp will resume work on lowsec lag ui bugs and faction warfare etc when theyve finished the other games theyre working on at the momentthats only 12 to 18 months away assuming they release on time you only need to give them a few more hundred of whatever currency you use to pay your subscription and theyll start working on your concernsthey wont take the money and run they wont just start work on the next game after dustworld of darkness theyll finally sit down and make eve work properly you wont have spent years waiting and paying for a promisedland that was perpetually overthehorizontrust them theyve never let us down before
oh please you think theyd let you touch their baby by all accounts they dont let actual devs work on the game in their free time
herschel by all accounts from the csm they dont even let the devs work on eve in their paid time not until they finish the dual abortions that are dust and incarna
if enough people unsubbed and stated why ccp would act problem is people wont ccp can either allocate their resources to their shiney new games or they can make eve what it should be they know  they know that theyll get subscriptions to eve either wayif the shiney games prove to be more popular and more lucrative will they start to invest in eve again if the shiney games are a flop my guess is that theyll redouble their efforts to try to make them successfuleve isnt priority one anymore it would take a very sharp lesson to ccp  and soon  if they are going to ever make eve their top priority again there wont be any such lesson
no what you have to understand is that ccp is at the top making a conscious decision to follow specific business doctrines the product is great but it is coming to a choice between doctrines they can afford to recycle the subscriber base quite easily even and they have factored it in
its business for sure but the only revenue stream for that business right now is from subscriptions to their serviceproduct  evesubscribers to the serviceproduct are unhappy with its flaws they were led to believe that their concerns were important and that the flaws in the product would be corrected now they learn that the flaws will stay because the subscribers money is being used to fund another productthe subscribers want the money theyre paying to be used to improverepair the product theyre paying forccp arent wrong  either legally or morally but theres a conflict of interest before the csm minutes that conflict of interest was suspected but now its been outandout stated
lol i doubt that d
i just cant believe this nothing for 18 months nice not even a roflkets or af rebalance on the horizon what i kind of wanted to see on ccps 18 month plan was some stuff like1 kill the lag monster using whatever means necessary2 lowsec expansion awesomeness3 improvements to fw revamp cosmos4 mining expansion to completely revamp and fix mining5 general additional polish such as redoing pos mechanics adding a fifth t3 subsystem etcim going to have to wait a minimum of 24 months for any of these not fun
ive already unsubbed to be honestall 3 accounts expire in november if there hasnt been some rather gigantic change in ccp priorities not just empty words but actual fixeschanges by then well i will enjoy rl again without the looks my gf gives me from time to time
but are you gonna delete your characters 
touchUFFFD
fix rockets in 2012 before we all die
thats nonsense do you realize that people love this game but not the direction ccp is trying to take it to for my part i dont intend on throwing away four years of stories and development attached to my character and i love the thought of being able to come back but as i wrote elsewhere im not going to pay ccp for waiting until they start to clean up the mess produced by the last couple of expansions never mind the stuff that has been broken for longer than i can remember
exactly that is the reason all the rage quitting over the past years have not left a mark on ccp people say hey i gonna quit and now ccp wont get my money anymore but what they then actually do is sell their accounts or give them away so that indeed they are being continually paid for and thus the intention of the quitter is never reached people allways talk boldly on the forums they will all quit and stuff but then silently they continue to hold onto their accounts and do in effect do nothing if your serious about quitting delete your chars thus it is assured this account will never be paid for again
all i have to say is what the hellsomething like 85 of those proposals were met with were looking at it sure they have followed by a well get around to it when we have extra timeresources which they never do and we know that and they know that and we know that they know that we know thati dont particularly want walking in stationsthat looks nice but it serves no real purpose i do want meaningful missile pos defenses i do want rockets that have a place other than the last high slot on a dramiel i do want faction warfare that id be willing to try because its worthwhile i do want a ccp thats less concerned about churning out new content than it is making eve a good gamethe primary reason eve is so popular is because it is inherently different than world of warcraft and other popular mmosyet now ccp is following blizzards business model of expansions  quality whereas they started out with lets make a quality game what can we do to improve eve except that that new model misses the point expansions filled with new features arent the only thing that makes eve a better and more popular game and simply throwing them out there without considering the implications that they have on the overall workings of eve is beginning to ruin the experience
thank you so much for not reading what i wrote and just spewing the same blah again i now know it can safely be ignored
your welcome
further proof that you work for ccp
ccp works for me no not really p
i actually dont know how this will end i have learned to love eve as it is so i want technology ui and most gameplay fixes to things that already exist but the vision for eve by ccp that is provided by the creative director that is ccp t0rfifrans right is really different from ours they claim to see further and to make the eve universe more rich and various with incarna and dustthey go on with their ambitious project about the ultimate science fiction simulator but this in the end is not what players want we want a game we want fights we want adventure we want game politics and economics and we want to have fun we dont need a nice philosophically complete game world we want to get a funny and deep gameplayfor example it is known that incarna will not allow fights in station while for ccp philosophical vision this is okay this is not okay for the players that want to play with it only carebears have something to do in station so it is understandable that ccp does not want to include a combat system beacause of eye candy maybe its hard to have combat animations at the level of a walking animation but in the end a player wants something deep to do with it that involves shooting stuff or people even the carebears have to tank ratsbegineveisdyingand when people say that there will never be a sudden mass unsubscription they are right but a worst thing could happen that is player slowly becoming tired if the game and leaving one by one this is somewhat aldready happening but the rate at which people leave is lesser than the rate at which new player subscribe this process could change the playerbase composition killing the most active players of the game mostly 00 lowsec and wh alliances and corporations with the result of ccp neglecting even more those areas of the game endeveisdyingandfix the damn lag why at ccp they dont understand that 1000 pilots fleet fights are not fun why they didnt even comment on gameplay solutions to lag thanks trebor youre my hero that are the only ones that would work ccp owes us a nonlaggenerating mechanic for sov it is possible to have coalitions split their forces onto a number of solarsystem at once this is the only thing that will obviously reduce lag without reducing the epicness of the fights i think it will even increase the depth of the gameplay
most active players are 00 lowsec and wh alliances i donUFFFDt buy that maybe most active on the forums besides there is a statisic i believe in one of the qen that show only a very small fraction of the playerbase are in 00 and lowseci agree about fixing bugs being more important then adding new content but i also think that incarna and dust are important milestones for the evebrand
i think the real problem is that they have a bottleneck in developer talent that actually understands the eve internals and can be trusted to make major changed to the code without ing things upthat is why new people can be put on relatively light weight new stuff like evegate pi etc new stuff is also where unit testing and scrum etc seems to work well gameplay balance how to avoid the need for massive fleet fights lag fixing architecture changes ui functionality overhaulare what is really needed but developers who worked on that originally may have moved on or are now dealing with kids at home and just do not have the time to get in the zone as they used tothat said there really is no excuse to not have small teams dedicated full time on features that were left half finished like fw
no surprise here ccp needs to continue working on their ambitious projectsfull steam ahead
1 by activity i mean something that creates game content for other players players in empire apart from pirates and griefers that i respect very much do not create game and content for others they play a sort of single player game and 2 youre right with the statistics but i just think that this means we need more reasons and possibilities for people to get into lowsec and 00everybody knows that lowsec is just a playground with no value and conquerable space gameplay is boring because of lag people stay in empire because for many people its the best place to staythese milestones have to prove to be worth their expectation full body avatars without a combat system is quite pointless to me and many people the only form of player interaction will be bumping gambling and minigames and dust has very strong competitors lets see how many players are they going to get
how do you know what forms of playerinteraction there will be in incarna only because they have only yet shown minigames and chatting doesnt mean that is it also why does it need a combat system so desperatly to have meaningfull playerinteractionbe competetiveresearchproductionmarket are all mechanics within eve that provide competition amongst players and are based on players interaction with each other in a non combat way i dont see why within incarna there could not be a similar mechanicnontheless i think that at any point there should be a dedicated bugfixing dev team within ccp while other teams focus on new features and also that when the scrum goalsfeatures are decided they should look back more at improving old features
if anyone truly thinks that eve is deaddying  they have large lumps of veldspar in their heads if you look at some of the real trainwrecks out there in mmo land for example  starwarsgalaxies  may she rest in peace they are all still going and never got anywhere near the state that eve is in atm there is enough in the game in terms of content and shiny things to continue to bring the punters in and to ccp  that is what matters expansions are there and being worked on because that is what they promised the market so who is going to be more important  a few whiny internet spaceship flying players or the folks who have their hard earned readies invested in ccp its so cute though that some of the folks here  and the csm  actually believe that they can make any differencewhat some people in here dont seem to understand is that their actual numbers in game mean diddly squat to ccp they may give you a nice room to play 00 some nice toys that you are already getting bored with and some fancy titles to flash your epeens with csm but at the end of the day if you decide to unsub and leave  there is a whole heap of people out there just waiting to replace you so go ahead and rageemo quit  who cares heck you can burn your stuff and sell your characters and vow never to come back  and by the time i just typed this you have been replaced by 5 other new players subbing and if you think you are special because you have been here since 2003 or 2004 or 2005 and have invested so much time in eve both in game and out of game  then you probably are special in your own unique way 
i picked up that it looks like incarna will be staged in hopefully not like the pi disaster beginning with new avatar tools in a winter expansion ie the next onehopefully they actually finish the feature thats apparently so important to them
we at the cartel are all about injecting pythons intoeverything
its very obvious that you dont believe your own nonsense here and youre just using dishonesty to troll sok when sok reported the actual verifiable facts about ank all of a sudden you demanded his resignation and conveniently forgot your promise to demand anks if the charges where shown to be verifiable facts and yet when mynxee posts her opinion not even facts just her own personal opinion about one set of facts sok reported all of a sudden thats gospel and one persons opinion is in fact a widely recognized facthave you perhaps considered not trolling just for a change of pace
i know  and you are refreshingly honest about it
i once tried to insert my python and my wife was all like i have a headache
the csm should not be disbanded its a unique feature in mmos that puts players in touch with developers for the betterment of the game we enjoy this is a good thing even if its just for appearances sake or perhaps i am selfish too ill admit that there is this cynical part of me that finds the whole mess around them vaguely entertaining spoon throwing angry directors offended code monkeys nda breech lawyers on call careers in jeopardy smack talking reps csm booted others threatening to quit who needs lindsay lohanits my daily soap opera to break the total monotony of grinding faction rep as a rookie mission runner id snap flip out and kill st randomly without them as a game related distraction right now shrugs so thanks
now this is the first decent reason we have heard so far as to why we should keep the csm well done sir well done have you thought about running for the csm yourself oh you arent in a major 00 alliance guess you arent eligible then  sorry to get your hopes up
enough already look at the slate of csm delegates currently how many are in major alliances you dont like the csm we all get it enough
oh ok  i should of said major alliances  altpet alliances best to make it more factual i supposeand its not so much i dont like the csm  i just think it irrelevent and by the sounds of things i am not the only one and even members of the csm seem to have the same opinion one thing that is a pity is that no one else seems to play by the rule of that all people say their piece and be done with it i mean even you yourself dont follow your own advice and keep blathering on about stuff in here and elsewhere  so why should i againthis though is eve where even the most minor hirring gets repeated adnauseum so please dont diss on that which you have helped create it just makes for sad pandas
just so not sure about it myself when cpp say no to the csm do they think their saying no to the whole playerbase or no to what was at the time just over 11 of the playerbasenow i have heard and rightly so that people who dont vote should not have a say in csm issuethen on the otherhand do the 89 not votingspoiled papers countedgive cpp moneymen validation for not takeing them serioustodays minutes were a bitter pill to swallow for any player and lord only knows what the people at those meeting must have thought when i get some sleep i shall wake up and just make out i never read them and they dont excist and i can only think some of the csm are thinking ank is the lucky onewell next time i vote i would like 100k free sp please to make it worth while wether i like the idea of csm or not does not matter i do like the idea of being bribed to vote
can we please shift bile away from the csm members and towards ccp managementi dont want to see the csm disbanded but i would like to see the entire csm resign if only because its probably the only way to get ccps attention i appreciate what the csm have tried to do but they pretty much failed not through their own incompetence but through ccps reluctance to listenfrom what i can tell the summit is just lip service
the nine elected members are from the following corpsalliances in order of votes  noir mercenary groupsmall independant aliastranpc ivy leaguelarge independant shadow kingdomsmall i think independant morsus mihilarge nc agony empiresmall independant rooks and kingssmall i think independant initiative mercenarieslarge i think sc against all authoritieslarge scfully three of the nine are from groups that are even somewhat serious in terms of 00 blob warfare of course mazz replacing ankh does swing the numbers a bit but even after that the big alliances are a minority or do you have specific people or groups in mind when you start throwing around altpet labels
dont you think that if a had been serious about pushing me forward as a candidate that id easily have made chair truth is that the majority of a doesnt care about the csm and most of the rest have voted for other candidates omber zombie to name a popular one
except youre wrong on that count as well thats the thing it isnt mere repetition thats the problem its the fact that your only real point is grrr csm and its backed up by factual errors the reps arent all 00 power players and even if they were it wouldnt matter they dont bring back secrets for their alliancespower blocs to distort the game etc etc etc yes ccp has rather obviously decided to  in the face of the playerbase via the csm i think everybody gets that at this point but instead of demanding that ccp actually fix whats broken now instead of in about 1218 months assuming we dont see something else that oooooh shiny your argument is that csm is horrible all indications are that theyre trying their best to help us so cut them some slack
finn did you ever run for the csm youve got the mouth for iti mean that as a genuine compliment
the csm shouldnt be disbandedif it wasnt for the csm we probably wouldnt know that ccp will be doing very little with eve for a long time while they busy themselves with other projectsthe csm may cause ccps policy to change even if they cant do that they may save some people hundreds of poundsdollarseuros subscribing to a game that they were hoping would be fixed but never would bethe csm have been on the players side they havent toed the party line they have challenged ccp and they have informed the playerbasemy guess is that ccp are probably regretting the creation of the csm but it was great pr for them for a while
in my experience its completely impossible to persuade a conspiracy theorist with anything as intangible as well yeah im a member of that group but they dont care the sort of mindset that leads to this nonsense considers any link no matter how tenuous to be proof of collusion i decided to try it with hard evidence instead i dont expect it to work any better but i was curious
thank you for that wonderful ray of truthfulness this is the exact thing we have been talking about all alongthe csm is completely irrelevant to both the player base and ccpoh and its funny how corpsalliances made up of alts are considered small  independant its like saying that the teabaggers arent made up of republicans honestly if the vitriol and im right foot stamping from those on the teetering pile of meeting reports werent so funny itd be almost sadoh and finnagain  why should the members of the csm be cut any slack they volunteered for the jobs no one held a gun to their heads or forced them to do it  and to be quite frank they are being treated here in the exact same fashion as they treat others both ingame and out of game to hear them or the lone one or two supporters like yourself go all whaaaa over a bit of criticism is the height of irony i see it like it is and call it that way and everyone knows  heck as we see above even members of the csm acknowledge this  that others feel the same way as i do  whilst the vast majority of the playerbase couldnt give a toss  as they accurately surmise that it doesnt affect them one iota or there are completely ignorant of its existence
well the tea party may be made up of upset republicans looking for a new direction in politics but the common teabagger is usually quite liberal as they are less concerned with emotional restraint keeping up appearances and all thathowever the current situation is sad
think about that for a moment the csm volunteered to do the job of helping give the playerbase a voice and defending our interests while dealing with ccp which is evidently terminally out of touch to the point of carelessness and is using our subscription dollars to pay for the development costs on new games while they let all the damaged bits of eve rot on the vine in payment for their effort folks are slinging conspiracy theory nonsense at them and doing their best to remove the limited ability that the csm does have to put pressure on ccp and youre justifying spitting on them because the csm candidates are trying to help you oh ffs its easy to spot the non sequitor where the logic train jumps the rails goes off the grade and falls into a canyonx of the members in one specific alliance do not care about the csm therefore the csm is irrelevant to entire playerbase and ccp i see were deep in conspiracy theater tuesday today yeah all the small alliances are really just alts of the large alliances we dont have enough time and energy spent with our own mains capital ship alts cyno alts pve alts logistic alts trade alts that we have gone and created entire other alliances that weve also staffed with alts me i run 37 accounts
in light of the content of the summit minutes and ccps statement that they will not be undertaking meaningful work on existing features for 1218 months is there really any point in looking for issues to raise i dont mean to knock you guys  youve done a good job in showing just how little ccp thinks of its customers wants and expectations however there are already a huge number of things in the csm backlog and many of those things are vastly more important and wellsupported than anything that is realistically likely to be raised between now and the next expansion trawling for inconsequential issues that will just be buried in the backlog anyway and then given ccps attitiude probably prioritised above more important things ifwhen they get over their fixation with the new shinies kind of smacks of makework tbh

i think it might be a good idea for the csm to have a fairly indepth discussion about whether the current way that the csm works between major iceland summits is practical going forward particularly in the light of the results of the june meetingadding up to 9 new issues to the backlog every couple of weeks doesnt seem to me to be sustainable the issues seem to vary wildly in scale from trivial fixes to major expansions and timeliness from urgent action required to wishlistit seems to me that the csm should seriously consider putting less effort into sending new issues ccps way and more into championing older but very critical issues to some extent i think the csm are already doing this  i was pleased to note in particular the amount of time they spent pushing for fw and lowsec to be fixed in this last round of meetings with ccp  but i think that the split between creating new issues and maintaining old ones is still not quite balancedccp have promised to give the csm more insight into the status of the backlog and i look forward to hearing about how you intend to make the most of it
maybe instead of raising new issues since ccp wont fix any for a while the csm goes through and prioritizesupdates old feature ideas so that when ccp does get around to fixing things they know which ones are most critical to the player base maybe create a rough draft list of say the top 10 items and allow players to critique the refined issues for further discussion in the next csm meeting
irregardless of the why this is not the firt time a csm member has been bootedccp needs to wake up and smell the coffee like so many other game companies over the years and realize that you can not give access to sensitive game issues andor material to players everjust get rid of the csm
to all members of csm5 i have to give you all a rather generous amount of congratulations for your work at the recent summit with ccpi read the minutes of the meeting and although i have followed previous csms somewhat loosely and with little expectations this one has given me the most hope for the csm in general and the overall effect on the progress of the eveonline mmo which currently sees so many people brought together in one of the most amazing games in the worldyour vigor with which the core issues plaguing so many players where addressed and forced at least some regognition out of ccp in a way that we simply do not get by the raging and trolling which these forums are usually subjected tomy wish going into the future is that you not loose that vigor and push for these things you championed for us that in the future we can see eve become once again the most well polished and unbeatable mmo on the marketand to ccp  this csm has set the standard to be followed i doubt a better result could be garnered from the meetings as they exist in their current form their arguments and issues where spot on the money and informative for the playerbase that continues to see this great game continuenow i just pray that somewhere in the next 4 expansions we get the issues and problems belted out so that eve can again be seen as the uncompromisingly polished and strong product instead of its slow decline into a generic shiny new stuff mmo  something that would probably destroy eve as we know itin closing and tldrcsm5  you are awesome and i give you tons of props for a summit well doneccp  dont just talk with the csm their influence is a positive one and can be your saving grace
thank you on behalf of all of us although the result may not be quite satisfying we believe we have tried our best in order to get our message across the only question thats left now is whether ccp will listen and if not if we can make them
i endorse this thread 
secondedwhile the summit minutes depressed the hell out of me it wasnt because of the csm the csm did a great job keep it up guys were behind you
thirded csm was great brought up a lot of important things ccp not so much but remember that they are likely under contract to finish dust by a certain date and they want to meet that date sucks for us thoughthis is a really outside idea that probably has no chance in hell of getting ccps approval but what we saw constantly was no resources available all the developers are tied up with incarnadust but what if there was a volunteer developer teamccp gets work for free  they win we get some of the bugs  features taken care of that we want  we win the developers get something to put on their resume and it would be a good foot in the door for paid employment at ccp  developers win
its a noble thought but its way too dicey for ccp to handle i dont think they even allow people to be employed remotely and you just dont want to trust your players with the internals of your server code you really just dontit just boggles me because i imagine there are a good portion of fixes which would have great benefits and yet be amazingly easy to implement im thinking primarily of af bonuses and rocket fixes here which would be 99 design decisions and 1 database entry modification
hmmmaybe part of the eve serverclient src as a managed opensourceish community projectthis has some cool potential and i have no doubt whatsoever competent and passionate community developers would jump at the opportunitytho there are loads of obvious hurdles to make this into a reality ofc
and those are some of the reasons why it would probably never happen  but it cant hurt to have the csm ask them about it and open up the dialogue we may end up being pleasantly surprised
yes great work from the csm so far dont get demotivated by ccps behaviour you have the support of ccps customers more than ever after we have seen the minutes
a person with passion and some level of skill is a very valuable asset for any businessthere is a relative high percentage of people who meet those criteria in the eve communitythis could be a resource for ccp if played righti dont know what the top dogs hilmar nathan etc actually are thinking but by the minutes it does seem to me thatthey are very confused atm
you guys need to start working on your proposal for lowsec improvements if i read the minutes right ccp is looking for something explicit from you guys that they can consider down the roadalso congrats on your hard work

supported paying insurance on ship losses incurred during criminal acts breaks the suspension of disbelief if you want to get paid for hisec ganking buy a policy with the angelsbloodguristaswhatever those would be some awesome commericalsthe concept that you can get the kill rights for getting ganked does nothing for the miners haulers or traders thats pointless because we wont use them were miners get it most of us dont have combat skills to compete with gankers because we devoted ourselves to our profession having the cops tell you you should go beat up that bully we totally wont prosecute you if you do does not mean that we will thats a losing proposition thats playing the gankers game they want easy prey to come to them for cash and prizes and lulz if they didnt want easy prey they would stay in low00 sec if we dont fight they victimize us and tell us we should fight if we fight they slaughter us shaneuntil we become just like them playing the game their way i want to mine i like mining why should i have play the game your way i tank as much as i can i dont afk mine i like to watch the dials spin and the cargo fill up it makes me happy it also makes me money but not a fraction of what it has cost me to get to where i am like any sensible buisnessman i am trying very hard to make the greatest return i can within slim profit margins that means shaving away my tank in return for more cargo space and mlu iis and staying in hisec to live long enough to see a return on my investment it also means grinding rocks for hours on end latherrinserepeat as well as dualboxing so that i can haul and mine at the same time its engaging and entertaining and hectic to be able to do so i have trained and saved and run rocks for months why would i allow a system to continue that pays you even one isk to rob me of my efforts there is a phrase that goes if you cant run with the big dogs stay on the porch well we hisec miners are on the porch so quit barkingby the way i applaud the true suicide gankers  the ones who are determined to kill a ship andor pilot no matter the law penalties or personal loss  the ones who would do it for free they are the ones who keep us on our toes aligned and tanked these welfare pirates are just annoying
if anything the untanked hulk should not get insurance either it usually takes basic precaution to get insurance eg locking your car etcaltogether insurance is silly and should be removed altogether
1 games  fun fun  lulz lulz  happy u just want to take away other ppls lulz while u have funshooting rocks all day 2 oh and low sec00 pirates dont gank easy prey either same fail excuse different idiot that says it3 thats the thing with using an altif u have a pirate main but your mining alt gets attacked your pirate main wont be connected to the gank u suffered aww cant hide behind your mining alt when things arent going your way deal with it cause despite your claims which sound just like the others ure probably a pirate as well so htfu because your efforts have no other risk for its rewards just like low sec00 blobbing thats why your profession has slim profit marginsbecause many like u have abused this otherwise riskless profession to this point u can thank yourselves for your own continuous whining that uve brought upon yourselves hell ill thank u as well at least thats what u claim to be on your mining alttheres little to no difference between the two ure just want your mining alt to be 100 safe in high sec so it can be something u can actually hide behind just like the alt ure posting with
supported stop paying suicide gankers
i support the general idea of making insurance less useful to those characters that repeatedly lose ships to concord instead of denying insurance altogether i would tie the payout to the security status at time of purchase better would be the time of payout but i dont know how hard that might be00  100  full payout100  001  payoutsec1ie the absolute value of a negative security status 1 decreases the payout by that multiple this allows the people who just try suicide ganking out once or twice or make an aggression mistake to refit wout too much pain but would certainly make insurance worthless for those who get concorded a lotthis algorithm would tie insurance and security status together in a simple easy to understand storyoriented way
im not a pirate i have no alts i have two accounts i think your protest to my statement rides on my having a pirate main sorry i cant help you there i just mine it may offend your sense of fun but thats what i do it doesnt make me wrong just different personally i dont see the fun in being a jerk to a bunch of strangers but thats me and this misses the point gank all you like just dont expect the government to support you for breaking the law i dont fear lowsecnullsec pirates  they have their playground i have minei also dont get the funlulz lulzhappy lulz relies on making people suffer for pleasure i dont get any pleasure from making people suffer and i dont know a way to mine 4 teh lulz i still have so much to learn youre welcome its nice to know my hard work provides you with the tools you need to live and play it makes it all worth it everytime concord wastes a ganker in a t1 i get another customer for my ships buy caldari again i accept ganking and can flippers rats market forces etc as a risk to my profession my stance is that you should not get an insurance payout for getting smoked by concordmy epeen is very small very small you cannot insult me as much as nature already has i cannot hold up in a fight and i have run from rats in 7 belts i am a complete coward but i am not an alt just a miner this is not about my safety its about insurance subsidised bullies which i oppose dont change the subject it clouds the issueand there is a great difference between the two types of gankers i hope you see what i mean someday and whats htfu is that some kind of martial art i keep seeing it in your posts is it an acronym like stfu what does it mean have to freshen up hygiene is important but stay on topic
i agree gettin killed by concord should not give you money as you are breaking the law suicide ganking in general seems kind of counterproductive for haulers in general i mean courier missions are crap because of the risk of losing your collateral because of suicide gankers
signedi seriously wouldnt mind an entire year spent on fixing what is already ingame and no new content expansions its a sandbox game people will keep doing what they do since its character driven and will do it with more joy as things improve instead of more new broken features get added
signedthey wont take any notice though
hear hearwant my money for years to come then dont suck ccp
i agree as much as i like eve im only still playing it because of the realtime skill training and the fact that i can often walk away from the keyboard to take care of reallife issues the incomplete features are starting to get to me i have to admit its kind of embarassing actually ive stopped talking to my familyfriends about eve because they always ask questions that seem to result in my answering they might fix that lateri understand theyre pursuing a new market one i have no interest in and one i believe may be a mistake so that is another reason that i simply dont understand why theyre so anxious to release more halfbaked content without fixing the mountain of stuff waiting for themi am apparently not the only one that has made the ccpadhd connection as i suffer from it myself i am fully qualified to say that collectively ccp displays the same symptoms i do
hear heartime to end the ratrace time to do some horizontal developmentmake it so ccp
i support this even more than i did 2 months ago when it was first posted after reading the csm minutes for shame ccp for shame
sorry ccp but after all your marketing fap im seeing a complete lack of commitment and excellence especially when compared to the competition as a new player youll need to do more than just tack on half working features to get me to commit after what im seeing on the forums and whats coming out of the csmi started playing eve because im waiting on the next wow expansion and things are up in the air as to which ill carry on playing all blizzard has to do is not break something new when they fix an existing problem with pvp incidentally one that players asked to be fixed while eve remains as it is all ccp has to do is show that they listen to customers like blizzard have already proven they can and keep a simple promise proving theyre not just full of 
make it happen ccp
i didnt ask for piif i wanted to walk around and look at my avatars buns i would play wow much of the content storylines escalations are like halfwritten stories as a developer myself i know its hard to fix bugs in legacy systems but this going off in different directions

i was looking forward to playing dust and getting my noneve playing friends into eve via dust until i read the csm minutes i will no longer be purchasing dust im not ready to quit eve yet but frankly ccp is showing more and more that they no longer are committed to a quality game over spamming halffinished content signing this thread for whatever good it does im far too jaded to think that ccp cares anymore however
i wholeheartedly support this

hey did i support this with all my alts yetlooking forward to ccp maybe starting to think about excellence at some point 18 months in the future
im only two weeks old and even i can see that ccp need to reevaluate their priorities
sadly the heads of ccp seem to have lost touch with what they created and what both us older timers and the newer players loved about eve for the love of god and for the health of eve i hope the heads pay some notice to the discontent that the csm minutes have stirred it is not too late for eve yet and it is not too late for us to start working together to make eve what it should be
what makes me sad is the fact ccp just dont care about what we the players think this seams to be a drastic shift from the company i started paying back in 07fix eve please ccp
friendlies showing up in local and overview as neutral bug happening again next patch should be wholly dedicated to a gui overhaul and fixing bugs pi is lovely to look at and the interface is nice but it takes too many clicks to do things ccp you need to get gui designers and beta testers who understand that people dont like doing boring monotonous stuff in a game that they pay for
clear and concisei can appreciate that in a thread but even more so in an idea

unfortunately as seen in the csm summit minutes at the highest levels ccp think quantity of development time means excellencei cant quite get my head around the double think that allows them to state that wont polish anything that they acknowledge desperately needs polish for more than 18 months yet turn around and state they are achieving excellence

i support this proposal
better late than never heres to hoping this thread gets noticed by people in positions to make a difference in the game that fits my lifestyle like a glove
i dont think any of the execs can even find this forum let alone read itand dont think anyone else in the structure is going to show this to them either
i doubt that stretching the development cycle will have the intended effect of allowing more time to fix bugs and flesh out existing features the issue is as you discussed must haves and could haves bug fixes and extension of existing features will more like than not fall into the could haves 90 of the timewhat would be better is to have two teams running on different schedules with different priorities have a patch team work strictly on extending and fixing existing features with a one month development cycle and then an expansion team on the current six month cycle working on building new features this would allow for the different teams to have distinct priorities and should lead to more regular bug fixes
i wish us all luck in having any of ccps management reading these 77 pages so fari support the op

1i like the 6 months fix things 12 months expansion with a full team on fixing things not the guy down in the basement with an abacus and a note pad just to say they have people assigned to quality control
18 months before any serious resources can be devoted to fixing broken and neglected contentits amazing ccp can even say the word excellence with a straight facelike the man in the movie says i dont think that word means what you think it means
1 specially considering the recent csm dramaz

empahtically supported those minutes were eyeopening to say the least
you know theres a lot i could say hereive been playing since 2003 on and off in that time other than major stability and graphical improvements there has been very little added to eve planetary interaction is awesome and everything and lays a framework for vast changes coming with dust 514 and whatever elsebut they keep promising things and never releasing them walking in stations is a great example another is the atmospheric flight trumpeted for a while thereoverall it starts to look like pig in a poke marketing getting people to buy sight unseen based on potential which never quite materializesi agree that they need to fix the broken subsystems before they fart around with other stuff interestingly most of these are in the endgame where people wont be affected by them for quite some timebut all in all they need to fix the subsystems that are broken and add lots more working polished subsystemsfwiw wormhole space added a huge amount to the game and i would unquestionably have stopped playing it by now otherwise all in all eve is great and i dont really know if any of this is as bad as all that tmbut a lot of these complaints are about real gamebreaking bugs that affect a lot of the oldtimers maybe ccp is actually trying to drive some of them off
excellence my arse ive seen used car salesmen with more excellence and insurance companies more commited to their customers than this 1
is it really that terriblefor my money its the best thing out there by far but it does kind of get silly when theyre releasing all kinds of crazy new stuff pi without fixing what would seem to be some fairly simple and straightforward bugsi wonder what the code is like maybe the server code is such a terrible rats nest that theyre having trouble with itit almost seems as if theyre trying to maintain the existing userbase with some incremental improvements while focusing a lot of the development effort on something else it would be really interesting to know how much actual development effort is going into eve werent they talking about releasing a vampire game a while back during the white wolf acquisition could it be that all the development effort has gone into that and that eve has just been left in a holding pattern
this isnt the ccp i knew when i started playing this game

its not the mechanics of the issue that irk me rocket fixes etc so much as the attitude expressed towards the playerbase by ccp repsanyway 1

good idea
ive just read a csm meeting minutes that explicitly said that ccp arent signing any significant resources to correcting the many issues for faction warfare untill dust and incarnawalking in stations are introduced thats 18 monthsthe players and the csm have brought fw issues time and time again sinces it birth and it all has been largely ignored this is unacceptable why would anyone want yet another buggy feature if you cant even fix what is on the game nowi understand dust opens you up to a new client base and thus is more money but ignoring fw totality is unacceptablefix it now
if there was an easy fix i would be all for it but the entire premise is flawed as well as the executionwe participants cant even agree on what is needed to make it all it can be and i am sure that ccp is in the same boat although they dont have to live the horror eighteen months is nothing cosmos is just as buggy and pointless today as it was 4 years ago  some farming potential was eliminated but that is all it ever receivedfw is in lowsec and as such merging a possible solution into what can be cooked up for the area as a whole will not only increase invested people but could make for a genuinely unique environment
yet csm has brought up specific issues with fw that have never been looked intofor example i had to sit out this years tournament because to be on it it meant i not only needed a holder alliance but to leave fw for 2 months just to be abble to fly in the tourney the issue of alliances and fw has been brought raised countless times and ignored just as many times
i get that fixing fw is no easy matter but come on ccp throw us a few bones at least
id prefer they work on low sec as a whole personally by necessity any fix to low sec also has a benefit to fw
fixing fw wont attract new players i think people miss the point of incarna its to get a lot of new players into the game and ones that wouldnt try eve otherwise ccp has to attract new business it seems
please explain because when i look at faction warfare i do not see what can they fix which will benefit it as well this may seem very odd or weird but i dont even see low sec and fw as the same thing fw involves pvpers fighting together in low sec which is consensual per say for low sec pvp its pirates and most of the time pirates attack people that dont even want to fight they try to run away again unless some information is missing i dont see any benefits if they work on low sec at allive seen the ideas from the csm and community in the minute meeting and none of the ideas should benefit faction warfare this is only a very small portion and its only considered brainstorm ideas so dont take this as finalized version of the future version of low sec but this is what they talked about at the meeting so besides mobile homes signal dampers or hidden secret stargates which takes you from low sec to low sec without going to high sec i dont know what would benefit usplease explain what would benefit fw wrong fixing fw will keep players playing it and will attract new players already playing eve to go in fw so they can pvpfor incarna the whole purpose is to make eveonline more socialisingnothing else theres seem to be a big boom in social tools and sites like twitter facebook and all those useless ugly site why  because people like to chat together and its a big business oportunity i mean they live in their moms basement and they arent respectful to each other so they go online and socialize insteadok nvm i got off the track here lol
incarna has taken how longwho cares about walking in stations ill go play an fps or something if i want to do that
good
ccp hurry to do this
3rd alt in a row xdccp hurry to do this
having to spend weeks training learning skills just so you can train at a decent rate means your new player sitting in the same t1 fitted rifer not being abble to fit new stuff for weeks that has to be annoying i know i didnt even bothered to do anything with my alts until those where done
choice ive been running missions with my t1 fitted rifter while training them there is no magic rule that you have to sit in station while training learning skills if the skills didnt exist you wouldnt train them  so dont if you support this proposal
an example of why a proposal that is dressed up as something for the new players save the children is actually a proposal to make it easier for vets to train up alts what is best for an alt and what is best for a true new player are not the same still not supporting removing learning skills

to make it simple just joining the militia should put you in an alliance i mean we have most of the rules of one already it is simple and elegant
i actually clicked on this thread thinking i wouldnt be supporting it but the no sov idea makes all the differencetwo things strike me as real good things that this opens up 1 as stated in op the ability for fw peeps to do alliance tourney2 the ability for fw groups who wish to transition to 00 to have a more effective way of building up a player base prior to any such move

fw is great fun but needs a face lift fw alliances would be a first good step put in safeguards no sovereignty establish minimum alliance faction standings allow fw alliance pilots into the tournamentsgo for it

i am pleased to see that this issue was brought up at the csm meeting tthe only responses i have seen from ccp on this issue are along the lines of we might think about looking at this later on so i do think this is a relevant topic for the csm to bring uphowever it is a shame that this whole aspect of the game the address bookcontact list which could for years use some improvement is now only being focused on for bugfixing and eve gatea label system is greatly needed for both players and corporations but a few other issues are being overlooked especially the issue of the transaction log for standings which was removed in tyrannis as well when you set standings to someone you really need to have a way of checking why standing was set and also when it should be removedchanged the removal of the the transaction log is a great hindrance to the managing of standings most ceosdirectors probably would agree with me that it is virtually impossible to remember why standings were set to most entities after just a few weeks and if someone else in your corporation set standings you have no way of checking why they did it other than the transaction loganother feature that i consider greatly missed is the ability to differentiate whether or not a character placed in your watch list should show up as a loginlogout flash in the lower right corner often enough you want the ability to check if someone is online or not without having the constant spamflashing in the lower right cornerthere are probably more ways the existing system could have been improved on and i think it is a shame that this whole area was not only overlooked but virtually removed by ccp during the introduction of eve gate so what i am hoping to see is a signal to ccp that we the players do use and need this functionality and not just the new facebook like features rather than just sending them the signal to fixreintroduce one specific feature the folderlabel system but of course the label system is needed
i approve of this
i agree completely revert this at once
this comes from an idea off market discussion foruma way to group planetary structures to perform the same actions on each structure in the group eg you have all your heavy metal extractors in a group you click on that group and tell it to perform the five hour extraction cycle then each extractor in that group scans the planet and selects the five hour extraction cycle this would be for all structures and all operations from setting the schematic on processors to routing materials however the main focus would be extractors being able to group them to perform the same actions all at once is highly desired by those that regularly tend to their planetson a typical player in highsec you could have upwards of 12 extractors per planet the quickest way to perform a new cycle is to double click the extractor then double click the cycle you want to perform this means you currently have to click your mouse near 50 times per planet just to perform extraction i recently counted how many clicks i have to do in order to refresh my planets 274 clicks later i was done this could be replaced with as little as 30 clicksto prevent this from being too macroable the implementation of a captcha is one suggestion since this is eve and fully animated you could create a very effective very difficult for ocr to work out captcha rotating staticletters or changing colors etcthe captcha is just to address the easy to macro implementations of having groups if ccp believed the captcha is not required then thats perfectly fine its just an idea to address that one aspect of the proposal
supporting the idea
make the command center actually useful link groups tothrough itmy suggestion instead of having the command center centered when entering planet view add a slight randomizer to it without being able to predict where center is all the time it should be near to impossible for macro programming to functioncould we also ask for these things as well1  no more survey for each hourly selection its unnecessary to know this each  every time just have a time frame selector and if we want to know how much that extractor extracts a totally separate button2  remove the rotating building images they are pretty but add no substantive value to eve though im sure dust is another thing but they do cloud up visuals for instance in a tight pack layout it is impossible to see links from a southward placed facility to a neighboring northerly one3  extractor status displays need improving for instance when it is doing nothing it should flash like a processor doing nothing it should not flash when it has been given a job but not submitted yet and could we stop the rotating timer for each extraction and just set it for the overall depletion also instead of going from min to max on the circle perhaps inverse countdown as wellbe niceest if these were options tbh but any direction here would be goodedit note i forgot these additional thoughts
cant believe im doing this but its really not a bad idea so here goesoh and for those that are going to come in here saying oh noes a captcha if combined with the grouping of extractors you will still save a crap load of time believe me
hmm it would mean that you could click once per half hour per planet if you have all the same type of extraction thereso a set up likeplanets 156 extractors 12 basic factoriesplanet 618 advanced factories making p25 clicks per 30 minutes and collecting in a hauler once per day for a vast amount of p2 per alt 3 alts per accountthis would radically change the market there would be no reason not to set cycles as short as possible for many peoplei think it would be good to separate the capcha idea from the i hate clicking idea they really are unrelated concepts the capcha i hope isnt needed because ccp can control macro farmers through some clever secret method im so optimistic the clicking thing is the only reason the market isnt swamped p4s and p3s are already plummeting p2s are only cheap because most of them used to be npc goods and there are vast stockpiles i really dont think clicking is a big problem except for people who are trying to run 8 pi alts on 5 hour schedules the longer schedules are there for a reason
great idea puts a end to bots
the problem with this idea or this philosophy is that it supports something that is intrinsically bad in the guise of something goodtwo reasons this is bad repetitive stress damage and handicap accessibilitynow before anyone goes stomping on any cranks here ive suffered significant neurological damage this damage has displayed itself in some lossalteration of motor function as well as other impairments word recallvision issues using alternate input devices love my belkin n51 i am able to overcome many hindrances that exist for me though normal computer users do not encounter theseif the purpose of the excessive clicking is to create a speed bump increasing time vs reward then let us and ccp come up something that is a valid implementation of that not just a pot luck solution at least then the disadvantage would be shared by us all and not just those of us who are handicapped or soon to be from all the clicking
think this is kind of the point the naysayers see rancer gatecamps everywhere the people for the proposal see a three thousand mile long borderin order for this to work there needs to be a lot more losec added some routes one hop deep some up to five and multiple paths at each point means far less gate camps and finally the chance of losec being seen as less like certain deathbut no to the currencies
i support all of it except the currency part as there is just not need for it loli would love to see both lowsec routes only between empires and all empires moved away from each other a lot so there will be the need for smaller hubs on the way as traveling all the way from one to another empire would becrazy for one person but for that to happen there would be the need for hugely long ways like 100 jumps or even more which i think is way too much i rather increase the warp ranges by a lot which would actually make warp speeds of ships much more important too which i think would be nice
they dont need a fence theyve got fleets stationed in these systems and as you only have a few entry points all theyd have to do is sit on their gates and blow you up when you come in through the gate much as youd do when you come in through the gate of a fence only here you cant climb over the fence so its actualy more effectivethis is eve though not the usmexico border the cartels have their own space here where they have their warzone and lawlessness see 0 pirate owned space on top of that the usmexico border is a long line that cant be quite completely foolproof watched the eve jumpgates however are much easier to monitor definatly if you own the things as i can imagine the factions do in their own spacethe distance between say amarr and jita is only 9 jumps if the amarrian and caldari navy cannot protect that many systems between their 2 trade hubs then i doubt theyd be capable as empires to defend themselves against the pirate factions should they ever decide to come and say hi so no this is not the wild west this is not some place that is just being colonised rather its a hitech civilisation that will do everything in its power to insure its wealth remains intact and giving away trade routes to pirates is not one of those thingsi would believe that concord is stationed according to sec status and sec status is higher in more populated systems hence you void your own point about faraway solar systems its the same as where a city has more agents than a town has no matter how much closer the town might be to the capital than the city
nice idea but severely flawed this is an age where everyone and their mother has a jumpcapable ship markets would be about as homogenized as they are now any practical trader has more than one account and it wouldnt cost much to keep a disposable cyno alt in a systemjita to dodixie  ark rhea anshar nomad1 warp to perimeter gate  jump saves some fuel2 jump to cyno alt in decon3 slowboat to dodixie 3 jumps4 profitdodixie to jita  ark rhea anshar nomad1 jump to cyno alt in ignoitton2 slowboat to jita 3 jumps3 profitamarr to dodixie  ark rhea anshar nomad1 jump to cyno alt in decon2 slowboat to dodixie 3 jumps3 profitdodixie to amarr  ark rhea anshar nomad1 jump to cyno alt in naguton2 slowboat to amarr 4 jumps3 profitnot even going to go into hekrens my ing redeemers could and do jump that run
youre comparing a vast border with countless points of entry between two mostly friendly nations to a very limitted number of points of entry between potentially hostile empiresand youre implying that those well known points of entry shouldnt be fortified to hell and backthe empires better pray you never take charge of their defense also one of concords priorities rply would be to secure routes of safe trade between empires just from a logistics standpoint concord isnt going to allow its network of control to be carved into four seperate divisions unable offer each other support
rl examples rarely help as were talking about a game set far far far into the future however us comparisons are not appropriate at all as youre talking about a landlocked country  and most trade historically has been by watercountries like england spain and the netherlands went to great pains to protect their trade routes stands to reason that empires that far into the future would do the sameit is nonsense to think that low sec areas would abound along trade routes so yeah this proposal makes no sense from an rp point of view
erm what the hell are you on only two countries paraguay  bolivia in south america in the western hemisphere are landlocked plus mali and burkina faso if you want to count them
posting to add support for this suggestion although i will hate it myself but it does make sense gamerpwise in my opinion
you propose a solution that doesnt really fix something that isnt really a problem and the issues with low sec are more grave than you could fix by driving more people through it and like was mentioned before trading doesnt need a buff especially those already flying jump freightersthats the result of efficient markets not necessarily smallness anyway if you think space is too crowded and that markets should be dehomogenized a bit theres been a few proposals around citing the following ideas among others make the universe bigger by adding more systemsregions maybe also increasing the distance between the main hubs tweak resources and drop rates in each region to make them more distinct then they are currently you mention that too point giventhats just complexity for complexities sake  bad game designall in all an interesting proposal thats not really feasible glad it came up tho as the discussion brings up all counter arguments
deniedthat is one more attempt to nerf highsec and to lure all the highsec players into lowsec to gank them because pirates have run out of easy targetsso no not supported
supported freelancer discovery server anyone
supportedanyone saying that it goes against lore isnt exactly educated in the subjectmake jump freighters able to jump between lowsec systems but give ap freighters a longer way around
fantastic idea supportedi would like to briefly state that most of the replies against this proposal miss the main point that is to actually make the empires their own separate communities in and of themselves making it dangerous and lengthy to travel between themif this were actually implemented please ccp i would be making my home in the space between the empires as im sure it would be full of content and lacking any significant population  profit also i like nonconsensual pvp even if im on the ganked side every now and thensomeone mentioned everyone and their mother has a jump freighter these days maybe among the alliance ceos but your average joe certainly doesnt
excellent idea and i fully agree with the original poster i dont think it really nerfs any activity but it does add some real potential for profitable trade between empires
yeah bad choice of words the fact remains that the us does not provide appropriate comparisons for trade routesand there are 44 land locked countries in the world  they all count even if 42 arent part of the americas
for sure this will happendo you really think carebear will move to low sec you saw this will lv5 missions they wont do ityou hate carebear because they dont want to take risks and you think they will do it with this change  no waywith your idea go live jita will become way more crowded as all people who dont want to go to los sec will move to caldari spaceand as some already said traders who are capable of using ls without much risk will gain ever more than beforeif the goal of this idea is to have more people on ls it wont work at allon the price difference between empire it will change a little but not so muchit will only change who get the money by trading from a lot of people to a less peopleif you really want more people on low sec and im for you need to make it more profitable living inside or adding something new on itthis tweak wont workmoreover theres a real risk about a part of players stopping the game with this and of course ccp wont allow itnot supported

i support lowsec borders but theres no reason to abandon isk as a universal currency
no i want them to play eve at work  or perhaps subsidize their eve playing time suppose they have a 40 hour work week they should play eve at least 5 hours a week so if they play 5 hours they get 25 off work early on fridays or whateversomethingalso get the suits in here tooliang
how do we know they already arnt
target painting dreads
i come across abandoned poss in wormholes all the freakin time out of fuel and offline contacting the owner yields no results because they truly did abandon it packing it all up for removal from the wormhole is too much of a logistical hassle so they leave iti think out of fuel and offline poss that have been left in this state for longer than one week should receive some sort of armorstructure penalty enough of a penalty so that small roaming gangs have the firepower to take it down
this actually sounds pretty good to me more or lesswhat i really didnt like about this proposal was the but why cant i haz your stuff for free with no effort aspectbut what sencnes suggests is reasonable
with respect one could ask the question about regular scams carboncharon in particular
i think thats way too different to compare to thisand scams take advantage of people being idiots not people who are unable to log in for a week or two
advanced hacking 4 and im soldnot keen on the wardec idea this is supposed to be a utility service to a large extent and the currently proposed process will only affect offlined towersthough it would be nice when if fuelling a pos you accidentally move the fuel the wrong way it didnt immediately offline the damn thing and the storage that all your fuel is now in requiring a frantic 14 jump round trip to buy some moredamhikijdok
not sure where unanchor anchored pos mods on an online tower came in just make it so you cannot anchor the gripeadu on the grid of an onlineonlining tower and youre goodeditoh and this thing should have 0 shield regen ton of ehp via extra high resistances more effective rr forcing attacking fleet to actually kill the defenders and not just blob moar maybe after all that a single 8 hour invuln timer when it hits hull which only has maybe 25k ehp just thinking out loud
ok please outline to us the scenarios in which your tower goes offline due to no fuel and no one in your corporation to refuel it for a week or two in which there is no chance for you and your corporation to plan for this eventualityplease also outline the ways in which your tower going offline for a fortnight unexpectedly and you being wardecced in that fortnight and it being blown up and all its mods removed stolen is so very different from someone coming along and unanchoring your towerin both instances youre unable to log in and in no position to do anything about the situation hell if youre a small corp theres often going to be nothing you can do even if you are online at least in this proposal you could go and fuel your tower and set it onlining breaking the adus unanchor cycleyour line of argument to me seems to centre around one man and his alts outfits who have a tower up and routinely let it run out of fuel to save isk cause they cant be arsed to do pos logistics that week ignored the rd alt corp for too long whateverwhy should they be allowed to reap the rewards of a pos without the risk of an equalsized operation coming along and taking advantage of their laziness in not properly maintaining their multimillion isk investment people whose poses go offline due to lack of fuel are idiots you get hourly spam from the tower for a whole day prior to it going offline you can stuff a month of fuel into the fuel bay and its a matter of minutes to move fuel from the corp hangar to the tower when a tower offlines due to lack of fuel its because someone dropped the ball hard people should be able to take advantage of these peoples fail by methods other than i pay to declare war on you and blow up your floating space junk your multimillion isk investment your responsibility to protect it from the depradations of the rest of eve
30 days unfuelled i think weve covered already the various reasons why if you let your tower go offline its your fault i fail to see why a number of days that the tower has been offline should be brought into thistheres no requirement for a corp to have been active for x days or for the pos to have been offline for x days before you can pay a couple of mill and blow up the tower why should it be any different if youre stealing it in the manner outlinedwhy a wardec and bring damage into the equation if this is in additionto the adu why not just make it so you have the option to unanchor a tower at 50 structure without having the new anchorablealso i thought of a new name for the adu structural interdiction protocol module strip as in im going to strip your tower
yes o
removing offline towers through some other mechanic than just shooting them is something ive wished for for years there are so many of them out there and they clutter up my scanner
not supported wardec and steal the labs like everyone elseon a second note if a structure has been abandoned for a large period of time say 6 months maybe something can be done about it
its pretty simple one man one pos corps he gets into an accident in real life ends up in hospital for a week comes back knowing his pos is offline only to find his entire pos is missing thats just adding insult to injury there needs to be a least a little time passing between when it goes offline and when it can be unanchored by anyonemain reason which will probably change your mindcorp member altsyou have a corp member that is a pos fuel tech with no other rights he cant unanchor etc he knows the tower is about to go offline instead of fueling the pos he is looking for some easy profit he logs into his alt travels out to the pos waits for the very second the pos goes offline then starts to unanchor all the mods and the pos sounds reasonable to you or are you just a greiferthis is why i proposed1 a reasonable time frame to pass before anyone can unanchor anything2 you have to declare war a wardec warns the entire corp something is coming besides you cant attack structures without concord coming to bbq you which is why3 attacking the pos to structure is a reasonable game mechanic you do not have the right to just unanchor but you can attack it to destabilize the achnor in fact i would propose anyway even if this proposal is rejected by ccp i want to declare war on one man corps and attack arrays around offline poses and unanchor them without having to destroy the posthe idea of you cant just warp around looking for offline poses in a orca scooping them as you come across them thats not good game design
suportand he is right you cant just willy nilly just run around in an orca and just pick them up a war dec must be declared and and a lenght of time must pass to take it
supported  some form of game mechanic to rid our moons for idle assets due to people losing interest in the game without having to get 50 bss together to solve the problemgreat idea fits well within the sandbox schema
theres lots of good ideas in this threadwhat i think useful almost all have been said   a special module to force the unanchoring the module need anchoring 5 and hacking 5 the module have at least the price and the volume of a small tower can only be used on offline tower and cant be used to unanchor modules outside bubble range of an online tower need some hours to works at least 6 hours 24h may be too much unanchoring time the same  greater than normal unanchoring need a war dec if the pos is on hs space and our module can only be targeted by the owning corp on hs the owner corp got a mail when we online our unanchoring module and another one for each module we unanchor
eve gate which i have only logged in once before ever remembered me this forum does not please make new
this is addressed to current members of the csm specifically about how ccp seems to be ignoring yourand by extension the playerbases concernsif you recall the csm was established so that the playerbase could get what mattered to them through to ccp this is obviously not happeningwhen the csm was first created it received quite a bit of press i believe the new york times even had an article on it the idea of a csm was revolutionary bold brilliant and highly approved by everyonethe new york times might not care about the current situation with ccp and the csm but you know who i bet will game informer pc gamer ign imagine an interview with some members of or even the entire csm appearing in one of those publications csm members will be able to tell their story of how the csm started and what a great idea it was and how it has fallen short how ccp is pretty much going to ignore the playerbase for two yearsjust an idea take what you want from it
i can see several things happening if they do this1 ccp counters by proclaiming they are committed to excellence and nothing happens2 ccp counters by proclaiming they are committed to excellence and actually sets aside a dev team to work on bugsissues3 ccp counters by booting the csm members that speak out for violating the nda and nothing happens4 ccp stays silent and nothing happensmy bets are on 3 and 4in any case supported
selfquoting ftw
your argument makes no senseas others have pointed out spider shield rr gangs would use mid slots for tankthis means that spider shield rr gangs would have far less ewar  scramdissywebdampecmtpsebos  ability than spider armor rr gangsconsidering that 2 mids are gone straight away to propulsion mod and injector most bs would have very few slots left to fit invulnslsesslots free for resistsbuffershield raven 4armor raven 5shield mega 2armor mega 7shield tempest 3armor tempest 6shield apoc 2armor apoc 7etc etccurrently shield rr skills are wasted unless you also train for carrierslogisticsas you pointed out its not acceptable to have wasted skills for armor rrits also not acceptable to have wasted skills for shield rrshield spider rr would not become better than armor spider rr it would just be differentdepending upon setup shield rr would have better dps  but would suffer lower or at best equal resists  smaller buffers on most ships due to lower base resists and fewer slots to tank withspider shield rr setups would have inferior ewar abilitycurrently the debate about which is better is of course just speculation as for some unknown reason ccp decided to make spider shield rr setups impossible due to insane fitting reqs on the mods that make them possibleas a supporter of this post i think the game would be a better game if there are more viable setups and tactics rather than fewer
pretty much this why fixing something that isnt broken
but we dont support it thats the thing ccp has stated outright that theyre not going to put any serious effort into fixing the thousands of things that are wrong with eve for at least 18 months given their track record id wager good money that theyll say exactly the same thing in 18 months when we ask for them to finally start caring for their flagship product yes i have a lot of respect for ccp and its staff in a lot of ways but sticking your fingers in your ears and loudly proclaiming that everything is perfect is ridiculous
i dont want everything on the table at the same time what i want is some basic commitments from ccp to fix obviously broken content that can trivially be fixed it doesnt take 18 months to fix this stuff  most of it can be done as trivially asupdate solarsystems set secstatus  01 where secstatus between 0051 and 044awesome a huge lowsec boost which normalizes rewards with risksliang
when ccp takes 20 seconds to fix rockets i will support this
i for one welcome our new cpp overlordscpp  ccp cd
nope theres a myriad of bugs and half finished features in the game as it is next expansion will just ignore those and add another half finished feature that will never fully maturei mean faction warfare dominions sov system fifth t3 susbsystem and poses id rather spend the next 18 months getting everything already in the game to work as it should new shinies be damnedalso we need a not supported tickbox
this must be the worse troll in quite a while
i guess now we know whos the a ccp sleeper agent
if ccp keeps their course i think there will be dark days coming not just for ccp
cxx  cpp
no way i would guess that your mom and dad are paying for this account or perhaps you are just really  in the head if this was a project that ccp had developed for free and said we need your help and guidance maybe id support this topic as it stands you dont need support and pats on that back when you are getting paid to do your job ccp needs to wake up the game is falling further and further into low quality coding and ideas simple fixes are ignored in place of shiny new useless primaes available and click fest worlds now open for boring coloniesdont make these kinda posts anymore
i dont think either lol or rofl would suffice to describe what im thinkingi think my brain implodedwe should support ccp you say  like for example continually giving them money like in paying our accounts
is that an informed well thought out guess or is that wild uneducated idiotic guess   i guess the latter because you are nowhere near the reality with your guessis it just me or these forums are filled with nonsensical trolls who cant acknowledge some simple logical facts and prefer to throw around insults just becauseyou know what you remind me off people   you ever seen monkeys in the zoo  sometimes they would just start throwing excrements into each other for no reason that very closely resembles the majority of people on these forums take for example this guy quoted on top why all of a sudden he decided to make it personal and throw a piece of excrements my way  he probably does not really understand that himself the problem here is that if you behave like monkeys then you will be treated as such what makes you think that ccp or even anyone for that matter will listen to you if all that you do if just throw excrements around without any decent reasoning if anything  go ahead and present some decent reasoning well argued statement clearly layout what you are unhappy with then think does ccp have the capability to implement your idea if you would have watched fan fest videos then youd see that ccp is quite transparent in many regards with respect to workflows and how system works within the company for one they say that game designers present a lot of fantastical ideas but there are no feasible programming tools to implement those ideas in some reasonable timeframe pos deadhorse for example what makes you think that ccp did not consider that im not saying that it actually happened but there is no tangible evidence one way or the other so as tons of other ideas and fixes eve online is a project every expansion is a project those of you who worked in project oriented environment would know that most important skill is ability to prioritize and select those tasks which are more important for business than other yes there are some areas which require attention then go ahead and explain why with clear and consistent argument for instance pos system overhaul is more important than long term strategic goals such as dust for example otherwise if you continue to behave like monkeys and throw excrements around you will hardly achieve anything and no i dont work for cpp just a very long standing player
thistoo bad we dont have a thumbs down option in this forum
i already gave ccp my money why should i show my support if theyre not doing what is in my interest
crowd pacification productionstheyve moved on from control have they on a serious note i personally have faith in ccp to do the right thing yes im misguided but just want them to focus on all the broken and buggy things  half finished features they have given us over the past few years rather than focus on more new things that will be broken buggy and generally unsupported going forward
truethe concept of the last 5 expansions or so was very good but the implementation was horrible most of the features were scrapped before launch and the remaining ones were filled with bugs and instead of fixing that and using the foundation they had they just decided to make the next expansion that is conceptually very good but in practise horrible one that is a foundation for new iterations but ignored again just like the previous expansion
ill show my support for ccp when they show their support for me
i think the only one trolling here is you why would we as i stated in other places need to support people who are already being supported by our subs what purpose does the op serve are you trying to form a coalition of ccp fans or are you filling the forums with a thread that says stop what you are doing to ccp i believe it is the latter in many forms and it serves no point there are always going to be trolls though your way of describing them is pretty idiotic you also seem to have no grip on the way the changes in the game come it is not a game designer who has thought of most ideas for eve it is the playerbase and all the fixes the playerbase has been screaming to get for years now have been in a large part ignored simple fixes are being passed over to work on avatars for a game that in 18 to 24 months will be more broken than it is now why bother playing it just for an avatar at that point ccp has tons of support but they have abused the customer base badly with no communication that matters no deadlines that are being met on a consistent basis half finished projects terrible coding numerous bugs a lack of excellence in all arenas and overall the snobbish attitude of a company that has lost its focus and center you sir are just too happy to be playing a space game to notice these things wake up
ill support ccp when the fix eve so many old bugswhere the hell is the thumbs down option
bawww
no im not going to give my supportall i saw in those minute was pure unadulterated arrogance and ignorance of the problems in eve onlinei get they want to do grand things i get they have great plans for future expansions hell im all for itbut ever since apocrypha ive had nothing but trouble as a stubborn mac gamerive seen ingame issues that are very troublesome and completely ignoredive seen countless issues raised and ignoredi see ccp  footing every time the csm brings up a valid point thats clearly a problem and ccp just passes it offi continue to play this game in hopes of them getting off there ass and focusing on quality and not quantity but even i have my limitsyou want my support and thanksfix the ing gameput some damn effort into showing you give a crap and your listening at leastwant proof go check the mac boards some time this goes far further than ingame mechanics being screwy theres much more to this elephant in the roomthats my 2 cents dont like it dont care
your post in and of itself would seem to indicate the latteri will support ccp when they support me namely by learning how to prioritize and fix what their paying customers actually care about instead of adding more halfbroken and useless featuresalso excrement just because
emphasis on paying customers
let me get this straight you want me to support the ccp that does have the time and resources to introduce a completely useless albeit pretty hauler but doesnt have the time and resources to fix rockets or assault frigates or scan probes on overview or any of dozens of other trivial fixes that have been awaited by the playerbase for yearssupport the ccp that put 20 people on to the evegate team to produce a social networking app used by about 12 players and that was requested by nobody but that only had one guy on the ui team until recently when weve been begging for a ui overhaul or at least fixes for some of the more glaringly awful issues since well since eve launchedyeah noill support the ccp that says hey wait maybe weve been doing things the wrong way around here maybe we should pay some attention to our customers priorities and not just squeeze out yet another halffinished untested unwanted poorly balanced new shiny to lie stinking up the game with more useless features that would be great if they actually worked
dear mr and mrs csm delegatesplease propose to ccp to develop new ship hulls as eve is a game about internet spaceships spaceships are the lifeblood of the game i and surely plenty others would like to see new ship hulls introduced in future expansions some possibilities include new tier 2 destroyer hulls new tier 3 battlecruiser hulls moar t3 moar faction jove pushing it but who knowsonce again this is a proposal for new hull designs and not just new ships that use existing hulls navy scorpion etc lets put aside the wild and crazy stuff like landing on planets and walking around stations for a bit and get back to the basics internet spaceshipskindlygam
new ships already come out all the time lets not put aside walk in stations ok
i would prefer it if they fixed the game before adding another year of skill training so i can fly a ship that can salvage as it runs a mission
there are plenty of ships new ships are not needed go away
going through these one at a timewould be nice to have a t2 destroyer than can be used in actual combat having said that it would be nice to have a t1 destroyer for that toowould brefer bss first im sure they will all come with timesee abovenogod noand once again no t3 will be new hulls but t2 and faction have always been upgrades to the base hullso in other words this is a proposal for what ccp is already doing
check out the sabre scrub
have a look at the blood raiderangelsansha ships
no please lets
theres a limit to how many ships the game can handle simply because of psychological limits on the attention span of the player base as such theres a limit on how many ships you ever want to have in the game for any reason were not there yet but were actually getting up to the level where were close as such ccp needs to be careful how fast they add new ships sure they can have a 2005style orgy of new hulls but if they do that then they never get to add new ships again id rather they trickle them out over several years sure im less happy now but over the long run its more enjoyable and better for the game
there are no faction industrials
thank you for misunderstanding what i said tier 2tier 3 is not the same as tech 2tech 3 i want to see new tier 23 tech 1 hulls as well as more tech 3 battleships would be amazing
there are plent of ships right nowwhat i would like to see is new drone models for logistical and ewar instead of recycling empire combat drone models how about coming up with something unique for each class
problemaccording to the csm 5 summit meeting minutes ccp searches for a solution to regulate the blob building which eventually causes the lag the lag itself is in my opinion not really a bug it is a technical challenge so as the hardware advances and software solutions may be implemented the max amount of players that can be handled may rise over time the solution therefor should be able to adjust that maximumproposalthere is another area in eve that is almost unaffected by lag and where small gang warfare is usual the wormhole space this is regulated automatically by the max mass amount that can pass a wormhole if you form a blob that is to big the wormhole simply collapses and divides your forcesa similar mechanic should be adapted to the 00 gates and cynos something like an adjustable variable throughput of connections from system to system not for individual gatescynos the throughput may or may not depend on the distance between the systems the throughput should be initially big but deplete as more ships jump this still allows big fleets but not that bigany suggestions to this initial thoughts
yet again theres no sov holding in wspace so you are suggesting that whoever gets in the system first wins the sov with no actual fight everterrible ideaedit lag should not be fixed by changing basic game mechanics lag should be fixed by optimizing client and server performance
but this is bs how should it be possible to fix that by performance would actually be interesting how much a single ship increases the load on the server and the clients i bet it is not linear so this will never happen means you have to whinne forever except you bring up some alternative solutions
what are you talking about this is the fix weve all been waiting for or are you saying learning skills isnt a horribly obtrusive hurdle for new players and alt makers alike im pretty sure 90 of everbody else that plays eve would say otherwise
there is or was a hook in the tutorial where you had to kill someone who offered a pirates life to you a fair few people asked how they clicked yes to the proposition they still wanted to click yes after wed explained for the nth time if it did let them do it then itd mean theyd be 10 and kos to all the empires so people are more than willing to join sanshas nation and co if given the opportunity with all the risks entailed with doing so
if members of these factions arent able to enter empire space without being jumped on by concord or local navy how do you explain all the pirate npcs that live at asteroids and are fought in countless high sec missions following your train of thought all pirate rats should be removed from high sec as well as all combat missionsa more reasonable approach would be to leave concord out of it since theyre essentially unbeatable and more about a control of certain player behavior than a good representative of game lore faction navies would be another matter personally i think those should have a much slower response time and be less dangerous so that they stop enemies lingering but dont prevent brief raids such that in lower security areas like say 0605 faction navy doesnt show up for a few minutes and then only if you attack someone or linger at a gate or a station or perhaps response time should be based on the signature of enemy faction ships vs the security rating of the system thereby effectively limiting players to the same size hulls as the npcs that occupy local asteroidslikewise the pirate aligned players should get a degree of assistance from their faction not the same or as much as empire factions something like as i suggested above in my first postput in that context yes i think i would give serious consideration to joining a pirate faction as would i imagine many others then again moving all npc combat asteroids exploration and combat missions out of highsec doesnt actually sound like a terrible idea now that i think about it certainly makes much more sense in respect to the game lore in that it would synchronize npcs with existing mechanics regarding player criminals  faction enemies
thinking the same thing here
its probably useless to say this or to propose this since ccp wont do squat for the next 18 months or so about lowsec or fw but anyway but anywaysproposal make fw missions not appear on overview heres is my explanationhigh sec mission no one see it in overview people have to scan itnull sec mission same as abovelow sec missions same as abovebut for fw all of a sudden it appears its a big invation to everyone to come in and kill people in i just dont believe in free stuff in eve pirates or othert pilots should work to get the missions in my opinion it shouldnt be free like that besides scanning for a ship is really fast anyway i dont even see the point of why only the fw missions should appear in lowsec  is it because of the lp reward of course not since the mission location itlsef is pretty risky alone and if you dont do it right you can lose your ship npc or pirates

the other day roaming around in lownullsec i was thinking wouldnt it be great if there were random fightsencounters between npc factions leaving behind some loot odd faction item maybe and salvage but also allow players who happen to see it maybe have to scan it down with dscan or sscan to get a higher standing boost with whichever side they choose to help and likewise standing loss with the other this could help people albeit dangerously in lownull sec to gain standings boosts to help them get back the ability to go into high sec this would help to get some people out of highsec and offer another way for people to gain some standing quicker what do you think
idk if you live in lowsec and dont know how to scann for sites to shoot npc pirates to gain standing and lowsec missions are available npc fighting npc would be cool thoughsimple sites to scann can be done at the starsun in solar system without probes
im getting sick and tired of a blob coming and anchoring up bubbles off our station to catch our friend who try and warp in to fight and then there is nothing we can do but spin the ship this is getting out of hand and it must stopthere needs to be sentry guns that we can upgrade the outpost to to beat off these lame campers camping is not pvp and this would discourage risk free pvp that plagues this gameeveryone knows that the people in the station are at an extreme disadvantage and this would even the odds
i have an idea the people in station could watch intel channels and undock before the reds come into system and form a home defence fleet
that is more like your personal opinion and not a legitimate proposal not supported for the obvious reasons
sounds like your tactics are just terrible and you want an iwin button to solve your problem for you
npc stations got guns poses got guns but outposts for some reason are defenselesswhy not give it ability to anchor some pos guns in the vicinity maybe 2 large guns worth of pg and 0 cpuso no ewardisruptors  not enough to make it a serious threat but enough to give some advantageor give much more guns and nerf the crap out of docking games
the outpost defense is the guys docked inside
ive previously proposed sov upgrades to make this sort of thing possible but frankly posts like this make me think twice about it defenders are at a dramatic advantage in a fight on an outpost  you can redockrepairreship your opponents cant  and they shouldnt need a homefield advantage of the sort you describe to win a fair fight if its protecting people like you im not sure i want it
i also think its normal to have gun on an outpostnot something powerfull that can have an impact on a siege but enough power for people to think about it when staying near itlike 23 guns like on npc station or stargatewich can be easily incapacited when a fleet attack but will stop or at least hurt a gang of 23 people
if you need some sort of help against that gang sorry to say may be you arent entitled to live at that station 
sounds good to me
bump
population control in piunder this proposal capsuleers involved in pi will have control over how much they pay their dirtside workers the amount of pay set for an installation will effect how many people are willing to work at that installation each planet will also have a minimum wage based upon its security statuspopulationeach planet in eve will have a population of workers and a standard of living based upon its security standing planets in high sec have high populations and a high standard of living the high standard of living means those workers need a higher wage in order to be satisfied lowsec is a frontier section of empire and has a medium sized population but much lower standard of living this requires a lower wage in order to satisfy them but also a lower work force to be distributed among the installations lastly wspace and nullsec have very low populations of workers and are frontier planets they need a very low wage to satisfy workerslowest possible wage high sec wages  lowsec wages  oo and wspacehowever this is just the lowest possible wage capsuleers can set higher wages to insure that workforce is always available for their installations or to seduce away workers from competitors on the same planeteffect of wagespeople on a planet will want to work for whoever is offering the highest wages capsuleers who offer the highest wages will find their installations fully staffed this will trickle down if too many capsuleers have installations on a planet it is very possible that lowerpaying pilots will not have enough workforce to fully staff their installations installations that are not fully staffed will operate at 50 efficiencyexamplehighest wage fully staffednext highest fully staffed3rd lowest 60 efficiency2nd lowest 55 efficiencylowest 50 efficiencythe formula for what efficiency the underpaying pilots would receive would be up to ccp and probably not a linear progression this is just as an example adjustments would be made at downtime and it would be a gradual shift of workforce from lower paying to higher paying installations assuming that there isnt excess workforce in which case all installations would be fully staffedthe combined effect of population and wages means that highsec worlds can support more simultaneous operations but requires a higher expenditure for workforce lowsec worlds can support slightly fewer simultaneous operations but have a much lower cost of operations from wages lastly 00 and wspace planets will support very cheap operations but cannot sustain operations for more than a handful of pilots with their populationthis will make pi operations spread out as currently it is possible for thousands of pilots to use a single world for their manufacturing not excavating with no decrease in efficiency this is highly unrealisticfurther iterations could also involve transporting people from one planet to the next which would increase population at target planets dust would also effect population numbers as sustained warfare would result in collateral damage and a decreased number of workers available
this would have been a sensible coherent wise way of designing pi as such its doomed to failure still it sounds like a good direction to go and like it would be an important part of a good pi system so ill support it anyways
unsupportedyour assumption that thousands of pilots can all pile up on the same world with no loss of efficiency is flawed from the outset  too many extractors piled up one deposit deplete the deposit this feature is currently i believe disabled but it can be enabled by ccp when they deem it necessarythis feature does nothing except make pi more expensive for highsec dwellers its already a bloody nuisance for those people why make it even less attractivenow from the rp point of view planetary incomes are a pittance compared to isk a couple of isk would likely pay for the yearly income of a small family your exportimport tariffs are much higher than that
i support this petitionplease do something i have 29 year old my vision is 2020 but the font is horrible to read on my 21 or on my led tv screenplease do something
not sure how many of these proposals ive already supported but one more certainly wont hurt  unlike my eyes
my first question in the rookie channel how to change the fonts how many times is that question answered in the rookie channel at least twice an hour with a variety of expletivessupport
essentially bioships will be farmed ships they get farmed in space and eat planetgoo that you bring them the farms can only exist in wormspace they start off as larva and can grow into whatever ships these ships arent allowed to dock because their nature of destroying docks due to clautrophobia or suchtheir weaponry are primarily composed of acids which bypass shields and melt the ship this generates heat on the ship and overloads your racks the counterpoint is that it takes a fair bit of time and attacks to effectively disable your ship the acid melts your engines so you cant move and your racks are too hot to run modules it is possible your thermodynamics skill to be high enough and to be beefy enough to be able to sustain attacks from the lower damage bioships the larger bioships are however very poor at hitting targets which can movethe more special ships have features like pos infestation which essentially puts the pos into reinforcement in that you cant makes any changes to that pos or bioparasite which gives the assailant full sight of the victim wherever he may gothe drones for the ships are default little biodrones
so youre proposing an entirely useless class of ships with a bunch of abilitiesrequirements that obviously havent been thought through very well and to top it off youre proposing it in the assembly hall before fi
like thisagree
why are you still posting
the bio dread is actually interesting in that it doesnt actually have primary weapons the bio battleships fire their usual 1000dps at the dread who then redirects and increases the damage into a beam which does massive damage
yep pretty standard functionality thats missing
ouch similar thing happened to a friend of mine in his golem once and a corpmate once warped out to our pos in 00 ejected boarded a new ship then dcd and logged back back in to find his domi had been destroyed in the belt he warped out ofof course the logs showed nothing
next time in that situation ctrlq log back in warp out before the frig has locked you again
al the tags in the scanning window like probe names scanned anomaly names planet names all the text is preventing the user from draging the probes around you need to do all sort of camera moves to be able to reach your little arows and grab themits so simple just put the probes ontop of the tags and textplease please i beg you
oh yes a boost lowsec thread don your flameproof suits grab the napalm canistersanyways my idea was kinda simple reduce refining in highsec stations to a max of say 90 but leave the 100 refine in lownullsec npc stations yay incentivesactually that was my first idea heres the next onemake researchcopyingmanufacturinginventionwhatever other blueprint thing i missed decently faster andor cheaper in lownullsec npc stationsyay another incentive for industrialists to go to low and nullsecthere you go those are my ideas for making lowsec more appealing now go ahead and flame away as you wish it wont matter because ill be gone for a few days and cant reply anyways and its late which is probably why this thread makes less sense than it would if i were soberalert also proposing that ccp introduces t2 exotic dancers but ill save that for another thread
if you have read the ccpcsm meeting minutes you would have noticed that ccp is unhappy with the easy 100 refining everywhere so probably you will get your wish in one form or another not that it will do anything as mining in low sec is not worth it too risky for the return and no one or at least very few will mine in high sec and move the ore in low sec for refininglow sec research stations are already used without the need for any incentive the problem is that people using them will put up a long research job possibly 1 month long and will go in low sec only to recover the bpo and eventual copies so faster research in low sec will not mean more people there simply it will mean that in 1 month a bpo would be researched for more pe or me and remember that with the right skills it is possible to start and deliver a research job from a long distanceeditin the minutes ccp will not do anything for low sec for at least 18 months
that is your ideaare you sure you havent read that in ccpcsm meeting
how much the csm real value 
moved from assembly hall to jita park speakers corner
this is totally the first thread of its kind
i love that this game is actually challenging and involves risk if you want an easy riskfree game like wow then gasp go play wowbut leave the game i love for its challenges alone
hey jester i seem to remember you in the hulkageddon 3 chat channel daring people to come and find you looks like they did htfu and learn not to bearbait
when i saw the thread title i was expecting to see toplessness oh well
ranting is not allowed thread locked
naaahsince when has eve been about making things safethere are plenty of safe mmos eve is not nor should it be one of them
read the op again he is not talking about cycling characters at all i realize its hard to open ones mind to a terrible idea like this
the difference between carebear alts and suicide ganking throwaway alts suicide ganking alts r throwaway which means sp training time spent and isk on skillbooks repeatedly every cycle and how many times does this have to be done for carebear alts once thats why hiding behind a carebear alt when things arent going their way should have risks and consequences cause not every carebear alt is from a carebear main aka pirate main of course u probably knew this last part already since u probably fit this description
ok maybe safe is the wrong word here but the main thing is that its too easy for suicide gankers can flippers etc to hide in the npc corporations as if we want we cant war dec them the basic idea is equal out possibilities as i said we not against it we will not like it but its part of the game we just want them out of the npc corporations so those corporations where the character belong to can be war decdthe points made earlier about the haulers and freighters yeah we overlooked that issue and we thanking to put it up to make the idea more suitable we gonna work on that as well
tons of 00 has no sov why because nobody can hold onto it mostly because they cant easily become allied with the block in the area if you show up you get spanked out of the arealowsec getting sov will be even worse you literally cant ally the area the resources are all claimed more or less the resources arent even worth fighting over most of the timewant to fix lowsec you have to fix why people dont go there i think the resources are sufficient we need to eliminate the piracy part not remove it but nerf it furthermore we need to fix the sec hit problem sec hit should apply only to piracyif i go to destroy someones tower i lose sec nobody should lose sec nor go flashy nor should the defendersif my 100man group fights another 100man fleet the first groups fc calls his primary who isnt flashy while the other fleet calls a person who isnt flashy everyone then goes flashy and loses lots of sec when none of that should be happening
lowsec is just that lowsec theres still the wardec mechanism for getting out of the sec status drops but dealing with those sec status decreases is part of unsanctioned fighting in empire spacethe problems with lowsecurity space at the moment imo1 insufficient financial motive to go there you can make more money mining veldspar and l4s are readily available in highsecurity space not to mention the need for increased security or evasion would wipe out any potential profit margin2 the tendency of everyone in lowsec to kos even if for no other reason than killmailsnow as a noob why would i want to leave highsec to deal with getting killed all the time to pull less money than i could in highsec low security needs work but i dont think adding sovereignty is the way to it its still part of the 4 empires
to address this first and foremost this is not an extension of nullsec sov low sec sov as i propose it differs in a few critical waysfirst sovereignty will not be tied to sbus or alliance assets it is critical that low sec sov be different in this respect otherwise there is no difference between lowsec sov and nullsec sov low sec must function differently than nullsec it must create an environment favorable to lowsec activities and in some way impede nullsec and high sec activitythe low sec activity that i envision would revolve around the criminal economy it would open up new income sources which are balanced by risks inherent in lowsec namely piracy according to the csm minutes on the topic lowsec should favor criminal outlaw activity and it should favor corporations versus alliances what i would like to see is unallied corporations operating a criminal stargate and station network that exists alongside legitimate gatesstations the point is that the illicit network will have no immediate impact on legit networks with the exception of the hopefully increased population this obviously envisions more ppl coming to low sec and taking advantage of these assetsto be more specific i envisioncriminal stargates youve seen the missions theyre there in the mission deadspace pockets the only thing we would have to do is connect the stargate to a destination stargate in another deadspace pocket in another system voila underground gate system you can even charge for access to others via standings or tollbooth systemscriminal stations booster lab production criminal npc agents and the regular fare repairshop lp store etc if criminal npcs exist in deadspace pockets in hisec why is it so hard to imagine them being in low sec again as with the criminal gates we can just use existing dungeons and just open up the stations with docking rights etccriminal complexes id like to see some expansion of exploration into the criminal realm perhaps we could see some concord or empire faction navy plexes ie shoot them for some sort of bounty make them rats all the same why should good rats be any different than bad rats we could pick up those faction or concord tags for lp rewards buy orders etc from the criminal npcs i already get sec status hit by taking out gallente as a caldari pilot why wouldnt i just go to gayllente lowsec and kill them off just for the tags idk much about fw so idk how closely this mirrors fw mechanicsthat said low sec sov must not be an extension of nullsec sov the way i see it there must be a mechanic that favors small scale gang combat and impedes large scale combat in such a way that alliances wont even consider attempting capturing low sec sov to this end i recommend again limiting lowsec sov to unallied corps and getting a sov mechanic in place where you cannot bring a blob perhaps a ticket system on acceleration gates into a deadspace pocket or series of pockets a sort of arena if you will with a limited number of ships on each side and each side must plant some sort of flag or something does this sound like fwthe bottom line is this lowsec inhabitants will have low sec status by virtue of their activities once you go pirate itll be hard to go back for a while making this a career and not just a hobby living dangerously will be a given for these people
something i want to clarify is how the current stargatesstations would exist parallel to the criminal onesa normal traveler with high sec status jumps thru a gate into the pirate system they do not see criminal sov they do not see anything other then the standard concordfaction sanctioned gatesstations they can warp to the station or gates of their choosing and dock or move on exactly as it is todaya criminal corporation member that has sov in this system jumps into system they have another ov folder or setting that allows them to see the criminal sov of that system as well as the illicit gatesstations in addition to the standard gatesstations they can warp to the regular or illicit gatesstations when warping to the illicit gatestation beacon they arrive at an acceleration gate which will require a password or tag then get accelerated into a deadspace pocket with the gatestationa capsuleer with good standings to the criminal corporation jumps into system they also have nav charts to the illicit gatesstations once they arrive at the acceleration gate they get charged a certain amount determined by the criminal corporation to either personal or corporation wallet if permission is set for that purpose and can access that gate for travel purposes they could also access the station with the possibility of a charge for that as wellnow as far as contesting sov i was still pondering that but this is the current idea i have as to how to implement thata capsuleer with bad or neutral standings to the criminal corporation jumps into a system to contest sov they probe down the arena and set about accessing it the acceleration gate limits both shipsize and number of pilots through that gate this would put the two forces on equal footing say this gate is set up for cruiser or smaller 3 tickets three pilots in cruiser size or smaller ships can enter on the hostile side and plant a flag which sets off a counter both sides must be at their gates awaiting a countdown timer which opens both the hostile gate and the occupant gate which has the same constraints as the hostile gate 3x cruiser or smaller and the two sides duke it out until the winning sides annihilates the other and plants a flag which counts down and resets sovthis would of course make it necessary to engage in combat regularly but my guess is that those who naturally gravitate to lowsec would probably enjoy this system of course those carebears who want to avoid pvp will not like it but i really dont think lowsec should be be as appealing per se to the carebears

do you actually have any changesfixes in mindive spent a lot of time in fw 1600 kills with amarr militia and im really not sure what changes are needednot saying that improvement isnt possible just that this proposal seems to be lacking in actual ideas
wtf are you talking about  im talking about making fw a higher priority than right now  not a list of fix seems like its gonna be left over for 18 months or sotheres a whole list of things to change csm is aware ccp is aware of it i wont repeat myself just look and search especially in the meeting minutes
i visited that station today yup its on fire im sure its not the station that had an eplosion i few months ago you say this station got like thisa few years ago in some story lol wow ccp u can still dock in it like a new station lol makes no sensethe only thing thats effected in eve is my wallet sec status player rage and things blowing up these scope news articles do nothng sansha arent attacking and kidnaping ppl ingame u have to makebelievei know ppl have player sansha corperations and act like they are sansha or something like that idk what thats like
andbasically needed bump to reinforce quotes
yep was same as you boasting how awesome eve is now if a friend asked me about it or anyone i would tell them not to bother i mean there vids are good for the expansions but i point out to friends that game would crash and you be lucky to get into game if involved in big fleet fights hell it pointless trying to fight with 100 in system these days
ive been playing eve since 20034 and i can honestly say that if i was still having to pay real money instead of being able to buy plexes with isk i would have cut my losses some time agothe only thing that keeps me here now is the fact that the game is  in effect  only costing my time time spent chatting to friends while making my 80mil a week targetthe things that originally attracted me to the game have been left to wither on the vine and the new stuff always comes in broken and gets forgotten after 6  8 months
from reading the minutes best i understand what the csm wereare asking for is to do just bugshardeningspit n polish development for a release cyclepersonally i would be happy with 1 expansion per year going to polishing older content even if it was 1 every other yearedit quote is from this post
i dont understand why it is ccp think they need to wait for expansions before they can fix stuff why not have a seperate team working on making small fixes a small patch every couple of weeks to fix probelms just show us your doing something about the existing problems 18 months before any real fixes how can they even think its alright to say that eve is a great game i have never played one game for so long it does seem like broken things never get looked at or fixed after 12 months without sound im just glad my sound is working again
a 29 page wall of text im not reading because i can sum it up in bullet pointsa the game is brokenb ccp cant do anything because of a crappy console fpsc it will remain so for along time to come and theres not alot you can do about itdo i get a cookie
theres a beauty to this mess players keep playing eve  eve remains profitable  management stays the course  players lose players quit en masse  eve gets into the negative  eve gets shut down  players losetheres a chance that enough but not too many players quit to make management take notice take the right actions and get eve back on track pretty slim if you ask me so will eve go the way of 9 out of 10 mmos
theres other things of significance in there plus a few scattered gems of good news but yeah youve got the core of it
the pdf link appears to be broken at the moment it worked for me yesterday anyone else seeing a message like file does not begin with pdf trying to open it
something has broken instead of the pdf it is returning a html page about the pdf because the url ends in pdf your browser is just passing it as is to the pdf viewer which is unable to display iti will try to find out what has happened
really embarrassing for ccp and depressing for the rest of ushopefully this debacle will force ccp to realise that a relatively small effort from them to fix even the really easy and frustrating problems would pay massive dividends in terms of community relationsedit pulling the minutes off the website probably wont help
a new version of the pdf should be uploaded i have alerted the proper authorities and this should be fixed asap apologies for any delay
it better be identical p by all means change the shiny stuff like logos but not any contents p
i might be in need of a tinfoil hat but just a note the original version is safely on my disk and i will be comparing the two for any ninja edits
what changed if this is a new version
could you define new version please there were some pretty glaring spelling errors that i could understand you wanting to sort outwill there be a changelog and have the csm been consulted about the changes
original version just in case they accidentally the original and didnt save a copy pbtw it lacked logos and such 
i did a cursory comparison between whats downloadable now and what is saved on my 2nd pc and saw no difference so it seems to be the same file puts the tinfoil hat away
wow the drama resulting form the latest csm minutes is better than the game itself it has all the needed features intrigues lack of trust lies damn lies layoffs incompetence extortion threats you name itccp has certainly lost the ball when it comes to customer trust
a quick diff shows 3 lines were changed and in each case it was to add to or correct the list of ccp who attended
isnt it better to admit now that the csm is a nice idea in theory but in actuality it really is a marketing exercise to demonstrate engagement with the customer base to defuse tensions and encourage subscription retentionultimately ccp develop and run the game and so decisions will always reflect their interests ambitions and vision players are no doubt heard from forum posts feedback and petitions and it is unlikely ccp is not aware of what frustrates them as demonstrated in alot of the feedback from the meetingsid rather see regular state of the game blogs from senior developers encompassing design vision and stated aims than continue to push the facade that is the csm a group that from voting figures doesnt even enjoy the full confidence and support of the player basethe latest minutes just seem to confirm the obvious and the real influence is exercised by players and their choice over whether to subscribe or not i for one continue to trust ccp to support their creation and unlike some companies soe cough cough they genuinely do seem to care about the game as more than a financial endevouranyway just a thought after reading
after reading through the minutes and some sections more than once im left with mixed feelings about ccp the actual effectiveness of the csm and the future of eve in generalim all for incarna personally and have been anticipating it for a long time but after reading the responses from the devs at the meeting incarna is not going to be anything like i and probably many others had envisioned and hoped for incarna is going to be nothing more than a piece of fluff that has literally no game impact and will be left floundering in a semifinished state shortly after it is released there will be no interaction with dust players in the stations no walking in your ships and probably no walking on moons nor your pi complexes etc there will be no fighting or other activity other than pure socializing and playing mini games the potential is there for incarna to be an outstanding addition to the eve universe but i seriously doubt it will ever come close to that potentialthe winter expansion that is supposed to be all about fixes and polish is also going to include new character models which will force every eve player to redo their avatars this isnt just a shiny new feature or merely an upgrade it is the precursor to incarna since with incarna you will need fullbodied avatars and not just a head and shoulders pic that in itself is a major undertaking and doesnt involve just graphics so where is the time and manpower coming from for the fixes  polish they say is going to be the focus of that winter expansion i fully expect that there will be some but ill bet my bottom dollar that those fixes and polish wont include any of the major issues ie fw lowsec space learning skills bounty hunting  smuggling lag imbalances of weapons and ammo useless ships etc18 months in the gaming world is a long long time there are a lot of games on the horizon many anticipated by the same type of player that plays eve ccp claims that data doesnt support the assumption that polished content retains more players and sells more subs than does new features and additions that is just ludicrous how many games have failed due to poor maintenance and halffinished features how many games have languished with a small player base due to broken promises of improvement and updated features while rolling out update after update of things the players care nothing about and fixing things that arent broken the new plex revision is a great examplethe data doesnt support it simply because there is no mmo developer with the gonads to attempt an entire expansion of nothing but fixes and polish if ccp truly wants to commit to excellence as their new motto for the year states then stall dust 514 and incarna for a period and commit the resources and manpower to fixing and polishing the basic eve my guess is that the media and the gamers would eat it up ccp would be hailed as truly innovative and committed to excellence and id bet that the subs for eve would go up as well as a higher interest in dust 514 when it is releasedmy gut feeling is that the devs and management are beginning to lose interest in eve after all of these years dust 514 and wod are becoming the focus and incarna is just a way of placating the many players whether a majority or a very vocal minority who have been clamoring for it since the beginning many if not most of the devs no longer even play the game they have lost touch with the players csm is nothing more than a figurehead of the players that really has no power to get anything done and all of the major issues with the game are more or less ignoredim currently only playing eve i happen to like most of the devs and the game is still imo one of the best on the market today but its future is beginning to worry me ive played many mmos and other genres in my gaming lifetime and have witnessed many go down this same path i hope im wrong
some things to consider if youre planning on runningmany csm candidates have an expert knowledge in a certain area eg low sec sov wars economics etc so dont get paranoid that you know too little try to see what you consider is wrong with the area of eve you play and base your campaign on the changes you would like to seekeep your message clear and keep it short consider that there will be who knows how many candidates running against you and that the voters will have to troll through their messages as well summarise your campaign message so that it isnt skipped over tldr is not your frienduse multiple tools to get your message across podcasts personal blogs video message ingame mails and chat channels interviews with mmo websites forums all of these can be used to make your name widely knowncheck your work it is a constant source of amusement to me that people will spend hours on their campaign message but will fk up the url to their blog check and double check your workthats some of the basics of campaigning for the csm if you want more detail on running a campaign then go back over the last couple of csms and see what make the successful delegates stand out from the ones who fell by the way sideon a side note i did consider running for the next csm but after the recent csm headlines and reading blogs such as mynxees life in low sec the idea had diminished somewhat if you are successful then be prepared for frustration best of luck to you
as a long time player myself ive also considered running in the past but geographical distance family responsibilities and more importantly available time are against me and i guess that this is one serious consideration that potential csm candidates should realise being on the csm is going to be a massive timesink
this right here was easily one of the most disturbing answers in the whole summaryif cost equaled excellence the new york rangers would have won 20 stanley cups nasa would have parked a major city on ing pluto by now and waterworld would have been the next citizen kanesure spending heavy scratch on development shows that you are willing to foot the steep numbers required to make a quality game in this genre however that does not mean that said resources are being used appropriately
you reckon 5 starters for every leaver thats a serious exponential growth unsubbing due to poor product support is not rageemo quittingi doubt i am alone in this my 5 day reactivation runs out shortly i wont delete my characters because ccp might decide to do the necessary work on eve if they sort eve out i will definitely resub and ccp will definitely have my money paying customers have a right to expect decent service theres nothing about special in all this many subscribers have put up with paying for what they consider to be a poorer service because ccp said that the problems would be addressed now ccp are saying that the problems must remain for at least a year  more likely two years
those 5 people do not join because i leaveits not like you have to wait for an open seat so you can joina lost customer is a lost customerlosing herhim and getting 5 new customers is not better than not losing herhim and getting 5 new customers
about sums it up really
these minutes are a depressing read while the csm seems to have done their job ccps attitude is deplorable
except its their money and not yours
mynxee is the presentation you gave making low sec matter available publicly
true thats the one thing that bothers me about the sig still it gets at the crux of the issue  this game is broken and theyre refusing to fix it for stupid reasons
they are not refusing to fix it they will do small fixes and stuff inbetween people read the minutes like ccp said we will do nothing except incarna for the next 18 month and that is not true what they said is they wont be doing resourceheavy big stufffixes until after 18 months
its so hard to read your posts without translating they as weliang
tbh i have no problem with shc people confusing me with a ccp dev as long as the gms dont approach me and say something like id pretend being a devin short believe what you want conspiracy theories ftw
maybe its not as if previous csms had raised extensive lists of issues already this blog post has a nice summary on the csm4 issuesand we all have our longstanding favourites small ones like perhaps overview ghosts you know those nonexisting ships that only disappear when you refresh the overview by pressing tab twice or the brilliant ui choices like having destructive actions right next to oftenused actions on rightclick menues really really hard to fix or bigger ones like the missing iterations on the new sov concept that has been introduced with ohsogreat expectations never mind that people constantly have to petition broken sov structures  and dont even get me started on factional warfare or perhaps a working forum that has been promised for yearsinstead we have great new features like planetary interaction which is about as immersive as a small cup of warm water from a company that has phrases like a virtual reality is about true human interaction and true human emotions in a living and evolving world on their web page oh my
there is allways gonna be new features and there is also allways gonna be bugs that doesnt mean that no bugs get fixed tho all you need to do is read back through the changelogs of the patches in every patch some things get fixed even tho you might all say that bug fixing is more important then new features truth is if ccp would only bug fix for a year and not release new features they would loose more subscribers over that and if you were to really adress all bugs you would need serveral years like that
i stand by my previous post they make poke and prod a bit but they arent doing anything that even approximates making an attempt to fix the game
do that 
not spitting on them at all  we have just been pointing out the whole irrelevancy thing  you know how they meet publish notes nothing happens rinse  repeat its like the old adage if you are doing something pointless and it results in nothing why do you keep doing it anyway there are lots of means for the player base to get their info across to ccp they just dont need the cool kids to do it for themand you seem do seem to delight in spending time trying to poke holes in the whole idea that they are somehow relevant and will grasp at any little straw waving in the wind brandishing it for all to see as the proof as to your view but hey irrelevance does as irrelevance will do
i point out the actual serious logical and factual flaws of your argument and instead youd like to pretend that its foot stamping and arm waving i guess when you cant address an honest argument you can start flamebaiting just like you admitted that you were spitting on the csm and said it was justified because they were volunteers whod signed up for the job and nobody put a gun against their head and then you turned right around and denied what youre just admitted but your comments are still on the record all your nonsense about major 00 alliances staffing smaller ones with their alts and thus the csm is a conspiracy of 00 alliances that the csm is indefensible and its members know that and that its perfectly valid to posit a conspiracy and question the loyalty and motives of all the csm members and thats just on the last two pages of this thread alone we get it you dont like the csm and youre willing to make up anything that supports your preconceived notions okay the csm has an uphill battle to fight in order to give a voice to the playerbase including you and youre doing your part to make it harder good job
thanks we all contribute in whatever way we can
which csm owns the finn alt
bah everybody knows that sok is my alt however i am vuks alt you know how those nc folks stick together
bitter ccp employ spotted
i hadnt seen this thread before i had no idea that anyone could actually be this sincerely sycophantic
just check out the posting history of the op its no surprise
google tells me that excellence is the state or quality of excelling particularly in the field of business and organizations excellence is considered to be an important value and a goal to be pursued it goes on to tell me that excelling is to surpass someone or something to be better or do better than someone or something to be much better than others so  excellence is to be much better than othersthe recent csm minutes have left many  including me  feeling incredibly depressed really has ccp given up on us have they given up on excellence no polish no bug fixes no exploit fixes  nothing for 18 months until these unwanted dustincarna features are releasedwell maybe they havent given up on excellence you just have to look at it from the right direction to see it lets start by examining some excellent things that eve hasthe player run economy i know that certain people usually people who have spent lots of time looking at the market or economy can potentially dispute the player run and economy parts yes ccp controls the isk faucetssinks and the material inputs but the players do the rest we even have a real economist studying the game economy really it is excellenceepic alliances wars and fleets i remember a long time ago when i was in corus of dawn which became youwhat there was an alliance mail detailing the bob vs nc war and all the implications of what each battle meant the person who wrote it obviously had a spy ring and come to find out that spy rings epic tempers personality flaws personality cults emo rage and an enormous amount of player blood sweat and tears are all but the start of this really it is excellencei could go on but for the sake of brevity ill stop here we can all point to our favorite fight mission loot drop blueprint ship espionage corp theft etc thats why were here because we love eve and now we  through the csm  are saying that eve isnt excellent we point at fleet lag the new sov system faction warfare cosmos low sec and much more things that to us reek of being unfinished and we look at the resources taken from this and given to dustincarna and think ccp has given up on excellencebut i think that ccp is still devoted to excellence  a dream that is all consuming and perfect the desire to go anywhere do anything from shooting people on planets to serving drinks in bars should ccp truly restrict the sandbox to purely internet spaceships well i dont think so  so long as they dont neglect internet spaceshipsi think that what we have is a failure to communicate properly most of the major outstanding problems mentioned in the csm minutes are pretty minor on the whole fleet lag is killer and resources are already being devoted to it faction warfare exploits are rampant and low sec sucks  and ccp doesnt deny these things they do want to fix them but they dont have the resources to do it excellentlywhat im going to argue here is that ccp does have the resources to fix these things with excellence many people in this game are experts on their fields of interest  and these are untapped resources that can be used to remove the overwhelming bulk of the grunt work from the teams we can come up with solutions that can be completed by a scrum team in weeks instead of monthswhat this really gives us  all of us including ccp  is the excellence we seek and nobody really gets left in the rain and dustincarna pipelines arent appreciably taken away fromccp delivering 80 now is better excellence than perfection after dust and incarnaliang
what you have is a catch22 situation in that most of us who have been playing eve forever i know i know and hoping for fixes are so far gone as to having much faith in ccp that we just play the game and find a mediocrum of fun in what iswe could write up big and impressive ideas to collaborate on to improve the design of eve in areas we know well in fact weve done it i can think of two topics off the top of my headone on needed corp toolui improvements and another on pos functionality and ui improvements oh and did i mention that theyve been there for years and not a bit of these topics have been implemented or even discussed with us by ccpccp your original player base 2003 2004 is either working at ccp quit or so apathetic we dont care what you do anymore as long as i can ctrlclick and f1f4 eves working
i agree that eve is excellent and apparently csm are a bunch of selfimportant complainers i mean its one thing for them to denounce ccp here on the forums another thing entirely to show up in person and tell the human beings over there that theyre failures because they havent solved lag or something
are you lana torrin
here is one giant hole in your logic last time i checked fleet battles were borked and have been borked for 7 months still not fixed and still not going to get fixed yep thats right the 1 advertising feature of eve are these epic wars which are currently unplayable sounds excellent to me
while i completely understand your point of view here you have to understand that ccp didnt say they werent going to fix fleet lag  instead they said that they are working on it my post is mostly aimed at the overwhelmingly frustrating parts of the csm minutes where ccp isnt quite getting the optimal amount of excellencetheres a lot that can be done to improve the game with pretty minimal effortliang
the only part that gave me a glimmer of hope was the part about them trying to support more keyboard shortcuts in the ui and make things less clicky
liang nuren is david cameron i wonder who is her equivalent of bumboy clegg
minor nitpickccp advertises it for a good while now as player driven economy as in the source of motive power driving it not the guy behind the steering wheel and that is quite accurate players are the fuel for the economy engine while ccp is the one that controls the directionback to the ops pointwhile theoretically and at first read sounding like a very reasonable idea i seriously doubt ccp will ever be willing to unload the grunt work over on their players without having a serious degree of control over them just look at the csm which is actually more removed from the development process than those hypothetical players helping ccp scrum teams would be and they still had to go through the nda thing and talk facetoface to really get anything even remotely done and we already had one booted for allegedly breaking the nda about something so minor we dont even really know what it wasnow imagine what would happen if some of the players doing the grunt work would quietly let some friends or friends of friends know about possible upcoming changes nobody else in the game knows aboutrealistically speaking i dont think it would end well if you try to do it that wayshort of handpicking players and actually giving them a job which again i have a feeling they dont really have the budget for in order to be able to keep them on a tight leash its nearly pointless to even fantasize about it sadlysure it could maybe work for some specific areas of the game but since a lot of things are linked together in ways which only become apparent later on well you probably get the ideatldr it was a very idealistic and nice idea but the practical implementation of it would be a total ballsbreakerthe alternative of throwing more money at it would be feasible however most likely not budgeted for
youre far too idealistic mate theres no way the player base could be trusted with specifics of the gamewhat ccp need to do is have members of staff that actually play the game and not just plsying the game in jove spaceempiresolocreate an alt on the db give it what ever age you want to give it faux a back storey for kms etc surely thats not too hard with direcet access to the server apply to some of the larger alliances and come fly fleet then tell us theres no laggo run cosmos missions and tell us theyre finego join a pirate corp and trawl lowsecgo and actually try doing any of the things that we keep screaming aboutgah im trapped in the circle again this isnt suppose to start till monday UFFFDUFFFD it im gonna go play civ 1
well i think that there are parts of the player base that could be trusted ultimately the selected players responsibility would be to come up with solutions which are simple to implement  it doesnt have to be super fancy just something thatll make it work until ccp can get around to making it perfect  which they wont do because 8090 of the benefit can come from a 5 solution at this pointits not that i dont agree entirely with your post but i got into a discussion with my wife and realized that maybe the source of ccps problem is that they want perfection while we want something that works and how can we get that  hopefully without further alienating the ccp development staffalso if only that were true i think things would be a lot better on many frontsliang
while the original intentions may have been altruistic over time it will breed nepotism accusations and further segregate the community into an inner circleouter circle camps nice idea but it doesnt work quite well with us humansi must admit there are a lot of talented players out there that would happily spend their hobby time supporting and making eve better in numerous ways this is an untapped resource what may be acceptable is a form of an oversight committee leading guiding and cataloguing this resource in the simplest term think of it as a heavilydraconianly moderated f  i forum with mentors and heavy devs feedbackyou need to get the culture going before the rest of the pack will follow
rather than talking about how the players might be able to provide better solutions why dont we come up with better solutions thats what the features  ideas forum is for after alli too would love it if the csm was taken seriously by ccp as an actual stakeholder in the order of at least a chicken in the typical scrum methodology pigs  chickens scenario its a fact of life that people will be tempted to abuse their privileges  t20 did it that we know of and two csm members have broken their nda agreement that we know of these are just identified risks that ccp needs to deal with  many of their developers also play the game so its going to happen again  and not try to overinsulate themselves from by keeping the csm at arms lengthin the meantime keep trying to come up with suggestions as to how faction warfare lowsec and nullsec can all be fixed in terms of gameplay and trust ccp to solve the technical problems of making huge fleet fights playablefeatures  ideas assembly hall csm  these are the tools we already have at our disposal to change this game for the better
thats not the way player ui design works at all there is absolutely no access to any server code and no confidential information is requiredit does work and its been done successfully for years it was stated as one of the key reasons for another games growth it simply needs a scripting language which is very easy to amend such as lua its even free for ccp its a simple language that allows fonts colours positioning and all the elements of a ui with absolutely no change or knowledge needed of the server side code it also very versatile as ccp can control easily any of the lua features it does not want to usewhen i came here from the other game the first thing i noticed in eve is how terribly designed the ui is and it puts many people off playing thats a shamemany eve players are so used to the ui now they dont always realise the shameful state of the game ui compared to even basic free mmorpgs you get these daysccp must know this or do they only look at eve i can only assume they have decided its too much effort to correct that means this game will have a limited shelf life and has no change in hell of getting beyond a certain level of subscriptions
the sad thing is ccps playerbase would be more than happy to improve the ui for them all ccp have to do is make the ui moddable and well do the rest
some things new to eve have been awesome some sub optimal wormholes were the last really good thing brought in but quite a few new things in game have been pretty average and with planetary interaction i think i can here the sound of the bottom of the creative barrel being scdas a longtime player i would love ccp to spend a year polishing whats already in game improving server architecture and then finishing off a few of the things they put in fw cosmos pilow sec 5th subsystem for t3 etcits still the best game out there for my hard earned pounds the combination of setting relative lack of big brother control action and consequence social engineering and sleipnirs is just made of win
while i agree that this would enable the playerbase to do some of the improvement work ccp doesnt want to do it also opens a can of worms regarding cheats macros etc
hell for a large portion of it not even scripting or modding would be required  give us a clear understanding of the capabilities and constraints of the ui system and we can build static or animated mockups of itwhile some complex options screens would require a bit more im looking at you corp role interface a vast portion of the current ui problems is a matter of poor placement and grouping of ui elements poor colour and contrast choices unintuitive symbology and iconography poor font choices etc  none of which needs to be live to be redesigned and which can be done on paper
i agree with thatwhich makes it even more impressive that nothing is done to improve the ui
i think most of frustration and whining on the player side are because ccp doesnt communicate what they are doing regarding the issues we care about even when they may have a bunch of devs fulltime on ithere is an idea use scrum artifacts to your advantage ccp should be doing sprint review meetings where each team present what they got done a the end of the sprint just have a pr guy sit on these meetings and put what he can reveal in a periodic dev blog for usthis means if ccp is doing lets say 2 week sprints we have a biweekly sprintreview devblog to tame the whiners edit rephrased the whole thing after drinking some coffee
why yes i suppose it would be terrible for the game if the client allowed cheating and macroing gosh thatd be awful

a lot of really good feedback here but im not sure youre really running any more risk of nepotism than we do with the csm fanfest or just living in iceland i think at this point its really important to give ccp easy options with which they can achieve something either at or very near excellenceperhaps a process could work something likeccp forum postdev blogwe are spending the next scrum cycle on faction warfare and were asking for ideas from the player base on what theyd like to see fixed or improved remember to keep this relatively simple  we arent overhauling faction warfare at this time and were only devoting one cycle to this before we move on to the next issue brought up by the csm get your ideas in here subforum link in the next week things will be heavily moderated and the developers will give heavy feedback on appropriate ideasplayer 1faction warfare should be completely redone you guys suck raaaage moderator deletes topic and bans the player from the forums for 6 weeksplayer 2hey so if you toned down the ecm on the caldari rats it would help a lot 15 supports 25 not supportsplayer 3hey so if you just removed rats from the plexes and made lots more of them it would help a lot 18 supports 100 not supportsplayer 4hey think you guys could fix the remoterepairyourflashyfriendandtakeafactionhit bug 100 supports 3 not supportsccpweve decided that we really like the suggestions from player 2 and player 4 and were going to run with them stay tuned and well post updates every friday afternoon before going homeweek 1 we fixed the remote repair bug and started on the plex timers turns out there was a bug in the timer codeweek 2 we finished fixing plex timers and we lowered the frequency of these 5 npcsweek 3 we fixed a couple of exploits we received via bug reportsweek 4 we fixed a few more exploits its out the door to qa if all goes well expect it to hit the server soontmweek 6 its through qa with a few minor fixes this will be released in tyrannis 12 on 20100801 thanks for the help guyscome on ccp  giving us the 8020 solution now is better excellence than waiting years for perfectionliang
i doubt the op was talking onlymainly about ui design and i certainly wasnt talking about ui design at allui design is actually one of those it could maybe work areas i was mentioning but that would require some major redesigns in the way the ui is handled in the first place and the way the client talks to the server just see the recent pythoninjectionorwhateveritwas exploit debacle for one example of things that can go ugly so that things really become the way you describe itright now if full access to the ui was given you could probably code eventually insanely efficient mining bots amongst other things enhance pvp situation awareness beyond anything available in the current client maybe even write down some networked pvp bots i can almost see a hybrid multiaccount client where the owner is controlling dozens of pilots in a rtsstyle pvp op or maybe alliances requiring people that do enter into fleet ops to install the ui plugin that slaves their clients into the fcs custom client or god knows what elseits nowhere as simple as you seem to think it is there are serious potential consequences that must be considered
the problem with the minutes from iceland is that they left ccp and the csm with a bad public image both parties failed to inspire confidence both parties failed to provide something a token treat even to be viewed as a positive instead we only heard what we are not getting from the documentjust reading that the dev staff was alienated and angry in response to elected player reps who provoked a scene makes me cringe it shouldnt have happened that waywoe is me its christmas and all they left me was a dirty old pdf phooeyi dont blame ccp for wanting to integrate dust and incarna before looking at other major changes to code once done they can look at the more complete game they desire to offer and polish the whole along the way some of the major issues may be resolved simply as part of the processin truth there is so much no in the document that its easy to lose track of what unsaid or noted as an affirmative we only know for sure that no major changes to code will occur right now some fixes might be on tapreally for me the most redeeming feature of the iceland minutes was amusement generated by some of the things you suspect were covered up by summary blurbs true or not
as luck would have it this very morning while taking a break after an extended session of selfimportant complaining i wrote a blog posting addressing the very issue of how ccp could use the csm and player expert focus groups to iterate design proposals
off topicthe thing is that thee is no guarantee that they will go back and polish what needs it once dust and incarna are done the meeting in question in which ccp was asked tocommit to excellence got nothing of the sort from ccp all we got and i quote waswhats to say that the execs at ccp wont be distracted by their next big idea and forget about excellence all together the thing to to do is not to let them forget keep the pressure on keep reminding them there have been many blog posts and forum posts regarding this already we need to keep at them constantly permanently and when subscriber numbers start to fall we can say we told you so turn the lights out when you leave kthxbaiall that we we the players through our representatives on the csm wanted to take from that meeting was a committment a promise a pledge what we got was a probably and some guff about spending more on development than other companies we dont care about other companies or other games for that matter we care about eve and the ccp execs need to get their head around that and get back to caring about eve as well instead of their bank accounts and anonymous statistics stop looking at the bottom line and come back to the game you created and which you used to give a damn aboutthe csm havent got a bad public image from this they did what we asked them to in the most supported thread in the history of the assembly hall ccp have got themselves a bad image from this and it is all their own doing it was quite clear from the minutes that there are no resources for even minor fixes and anything that does get fixed is a sideeffect of other projects the graphics fixes and memory leaks detailed in a recent dev blog for example came from the mass testing being donn in an effort to figure out how to fix the lag problemthat being said hats off to ccp for releasing the mintues at all they were under no obligation to do so and the storm theyre weathering now due to their release is far worse than the one that would have come from not doing sorant overback on topic ccp dont need players to help them fix eve they have plenty of talented and passionate people working for them who want to fix eve and polish till they can see their faces in it theyre just not being allowed to
seems kind of silly that the csm complains about not being taken seriously and then you have idiots emailing the contact individually rather than coordinatingcommunicating as a group i dont know that no emails cept through chair is necessary but posting all communication on the forum so the rest of the csm can see it seems like common sense
thank youhopefully some people at the ccp management will wake up before its too late
im pretty sure that most people would have prefered the combined csm standing up taking especially nathan and shacking him back into realitythe really hard thing is though that ccp bascially isnt wrong with most things that were said but they basically always managed to aim at the heart of the problem then turned around 180UFFFD shooted and proclaimed to have hit the target but didnt actually check where the bullet landedbeyond that the csm generally did as well as they could under these circumstances
they didnt for all the other csm ups  i still cant fathom why anyone expects this one to be any different aside from breaking ndas and seeing some of the lovely attractions that iceland has to offer for free and nah not mad just very amused
honestly the most effective strategem at this point would be for a story to be run in massively or better yet the ny times which has run stories about the csm before detailing the state of frustration that the csmplayerbase has with ccp and the state of disconnect ccp has from the csmplayerbase might take some serious pull to get that sort of stuff in print though
excellent suggestion i really hope that something big catches this and eve loses a lot of new subscribers maybe someone should give a well written tip to massively
i dont want eve to lose subscribers because ccp has poor strategy i want eve to retain and increase subscriptions because ccp realise they need to rethink and change direction
yes and from what i have seen the one depends on the other
thanks for the support hereand if not that at least for caring enough to post an opinion whether pro or con im not quite ready to give up on the csm process the game or ccp just yet but a lot depends on the nature and timeliness of ccps responses to both players and csm between now and the december summitalsolots of posts in this forum i want to reply to but work is easily 12 hrs a day this week and no web access from there eitherat least not to here stuck with posting via iphone which is tedious at best but just wanted to let ya know im reading
in the resent minutes from the csm meetings in cpp hq cpp sugested that csm work with players to come up with a vision for low sec this would prolly be best served with a forum section dedicated to it the missions thread had a pretty good low flame thread that shows people are willing to help with ideasso for such a big project and to save differnt threads in differnt sections and as it seems their are people so fundermetaly opposed to csm they would keep quiet on what may be a good idea rather then post it in a csm forum the only soloution would be a one forum for all low sec ideasgen chat is only good for good posts bogged down by spamflametrolls ideas forum just go and look how empty it is so thats what i want and for cpp to be very heavy handed with trolls on itme bad ment to post this is the other csm forum could a mod possible put it their for me ty
if this got its own forum section then a dozen other game change categories would need their own forum sections too that wouldnt be viable at all just make a few threads if you think ones not enough
get a sticky in the fi forum and a thread in the assembly hall to show general support with the sticky linkedhave people post threads about their ideas in the fi forum and have them linked into the sticky popular andor ideas with positive constructive feedback get linked in the op of the stickysupport threads about single ideas could also be made in the assembly hall to vote on which ideas are actually popular enough for greater exposureits a bit to and fro but it is definitely possible to create a input flow on this with the existing forum sections
but its only low sec that cpp have said they havnt got clue what to do with it that apsect it is already unique both other secs they know what they wantyea its a mammoth task if people get on board not a case of 1 person with that lightbulb idea more 600 people all with their own lightbulb idea that thens needs either saying yea great or wont work becasue of blah blah and for sure its not just a csm burden and for all to be peachy it has to have input from the whole cummonity csm while do a good job under difficult circumstances are not yet at the stage where they even come close to representing the players of eve as a whole maybe they can mod the forum or at leasat some of them canmaybe even have it as a thrid forum in the csm section assemble hall jita park speakers and then low sec something or other
maybe we could use an external tool like google moderator which collects ideas and allows users to comment and vote on specific ideas helping popular ones bubble to the top i dunno i just threw together an example
yea that sort of thing we all been focused on the down side of the meeting mins and seem to have overlooked this part about wanting players to basicly make the vision for low sec cpp could get some doesnt pr about giving players real game input havnt ever seen areana net or blizzard say ok were putting a new map in now you guys fill it and storyline it
how much the csm real value 
moved from assembly hall to jita park speakers corner
this is totally the first thread of its kind
salute it or shoot it  anyone emoraging quitting can be as rude as they like with their departing comments but for those people working hard with ccp to improve our game btw thanks to you and ccp there is no benefit in getting ccp defensive and argumentative paraphrasing iirc nathans reaction and he does have a point  one can do an excellent job of implementing ten things of twopersonmonths effort each as well as two things of ten personmonths eachcaveat i doubt there will be overly constructive dialog while the lag issue is so prominent elsewhere my interpretation was people were not so much saying that ccp did a bad job per se but rather they did not do enough of job the former is an implementation issue the latter is a planningmanagement issueon a lighter note ccp lucked out youknowwho is saying one of the basic tenets of blizzard game design is that of concentrated coolness wed rather have a simpler design with a lot of depth than a complicated but shallow design once the eve playerbase realizes that blizzard is in favor of deeper design there will be an immediate vociferous outcry for shallow development from ccp
its hard to tell if anything would be better received than excellence wed have to get some first so that we could compare
id like them to add more depth to existing features instead of adding new shallow features immersion needs depth width does not do after all its space it should be deep in all directions
i am led to believe that several of the csm members regularly blog about csm issues unfortunately i dont seem to be able to find a list of links to the blogs of the current csm memberswould it be possible for csm members who blog about eve andor the csm to add links to their blogs on evelopedia andor in this thread ill update this post as i get linkscontributions so farmynxeeteadazetrebor daehdoow
you could call these blogs as they were done on a perday basis in iceland dont expect me to bore you with these awhole lot in the future though
thanks im mostly interested in the cases where csm members are posting relevant content on websites other than official ccp ones

you guys dont have to worry about a single thing i too am capable of being a gigantic carebear and infact i often take the opportunity to charge my corpmates a lot of money for basic items at our base of operationsi am a highly prestigious csm candidate and will take on the heavy burden of representing three thousand whole people that have been left behind in the tragedy that meant im representing a total of 4538 people which means that i got more votes than mynxee and probably should become chair now

supportedinsurance payments resulting from concord losses needs to stop these are payments resulting from criminal action whats the point of a police force in concord if youre going to undermind their authority with an insurance payment to reimburse a criminal action perhaps a better question is who from the csm is willing to pick this issue up and run with it ahs
i look at it differentlyi agree with the post but with a modificationthe aggressor should never have insurance paidthat would also make can flipping a bit harder if you get can flipped and you kill the can flipper  they should not get insuranceso i look at it  no insurance payouts on the aggressor

holy mother of god yes
hello guyswell i just read the forums a bit especialy this post 1 corpmate was taliking about in corp channelwell i know this game lack on 1 or 2 points as every game got his weak points considering the ressource they got comparing an other game with 6 to 10 million player they still do better ccp year after year have 1 big new features while improving his graphics contents name me an other game doing the same just look at the basic content you gather you fight you build you transport the whole game and gameplay is owned by the player no game have this feature as far as this one does i have to remember that everytime you ask something it sacrifice somewhere else its life investing in a car may cut off your new pc dream for a whilepevery mmorpg got his cap point when there s no much thing to experience the new feature are made for those player to keep them theres only a way to keep customer and it s make them enjoy what they use there s bug there s weak point but at the end this game is simply wonderful always remember there s always 2 side to a medaland to survive this game is in a perpetual rush of improvement and it s for us at the first placep
ccp has major releases every 6 months apocrypha for example was amazing this is excellent some deprecated features like cosmos that sit in the dark of the universe are good as well this means that there will always be some hidden forgotten features that you can learn about as a new player to eveonline this is one of the amazing things about the gamebut i would like ccp to devote more resources to fixing up old features every old feature doesnt need to be squeaky clean but important features such as factional warfare and the corp management interface need a complete version 20 revamp in my mind if ccp doesnt do this they will never acieve excellencethey will be a niche unique company but never excellent unless they devote significantly more resources to expansing and polishing older features the game as a whole should always be roughly on the same level of quality my friend who tried eve for example ended up quitting because missions sucked horrible i told him epic arcs were cool and wormhole npcs were worthy opponents but the 5 year old missions he was running turned him off of the game

i spent the day at work thinking of things ccp fixed and did it well this is just to give them an idea of what to aim for when they get around to itin a year and a half the rigs revamp was spot on and put rigs on practically every ship in new eden the scanning system was much improved with apocrypha while i wouldnt call it fun more of a chore at least it wont make me want to claw my eyes out anymore  weapon grouping made life easier for players reduced server load everyones happy stealth bomber refocusing made the ship usuful again and fun as all hell to fly its practically made for whspace  all the server upgrades with quantum rise stackless io and all that technobabble it worked like a charm and for a while there lag was manageable wormholes alright im biased since im a fulltime wormhole jockey but damnno blobfests no local good ganks and tonnes of isk to be made tech 3 to boothell yeah sov changes in dominion while ive no experience with sovreignty a change to sov was long over due whether the fix ccp came up with was 100 succesfull ill leave to the nullsec crowd but ill give ccp partial credit for trying at least however the idea of paying rent for space you claim as your own is a cognitive dissonance if i ever heard one doomsday change was a good thing tooi think never been on the receiving end of one  however the proliferation of titans warrented a change no doubt and the boomstick they came up with looks to me like a decent fix faction ship revamp barring the dramiel has turned out well too no longer pricy hangar queens you see them out and about all over eve ingame mail and browser waaayyyyy more than 18 months over due but at least an ok fix when they got around to it still missing flash functionality with the browser though last and least planets they look pretty cool granted but pi is a disgrace as is at least we got some eyecandy in the bargainso fellow bitter vets nil desperandum ccp can fix stuff when they are allowed to they can even achieve excellence once in a while but the future is looking pretty damn bleak weve waited for incarna for what 3 years i can wait 3 more if it frees up resources to get eve back to its former pewpewing glory hopefully with a ui thats so obtuse that religion seems reasonable when compared to it please add all the cool fixes ive missed have a pleasant day everyone
please
oh good i can hardly await for walking in stations not flying a spaceship in 2011 thank goodness eve isnt buggy laggy and made up of a dozens of halffinished features imagine if something as important as sov was bugged that would suck wouldnt it imagine if modules wouldnt cycle in fights imagine if fleets were unable to load systems with less than 100 people in them i cant wait until another space game comes out thats actually playable
i think the csm minutes and ccps conspicuous lack of a reply to this uber threadnaught are evidence enough that management is hell bent on cramming more useless and unwanted crap down our throats they wave their newest buzzword stakeholder about like theyll actually listen to anything were saying ccp says they listen to the csm but the minutes say otherwise i know the csm brought this issue to their attention and ccp then told them as politely as possible to and im paraphrasing shut the  up youre getting dust and incarna and youre all going to love it you ungreatfull little s one of ccps concerns is developing new content to draw new players does that sound stupid to anyone else a if theyre new players everything is new to them eve is complex enough they dont need more  they cant use to confuse them further b most new players never stick with eve that long anyway and all this new crap and all the broken old crap is exactly whats preventing ccp from growing the player baseapparently several members of ccp management are console gamers who dont play eve and another portion are more interested in trying on outfits and fancy hats all day rather than actually playing eve on the other hand i guess that seems perfectly reasonable when you dont have to worry about how much isk is in your wallet and you can just roam around in jove battleships all day or just materialize 50 billion isk into your wallet
running late to a doctors appointmentstill had to stop to 1 this ccp this is an opportunity dont let it pass by
i support this however i dont expect or want everything to be 100 perfect thats impossible or in reality it would take so long to get all possible kinks out of the code itd never see the light of daybut yes more quality less quantity is something i happily support 1 expansion a year is fine by me
from the minutes its pretty clear ccp thinks new content is the big selling point i dont think they will rebalance the ships everyone can agree something is very wrong but at the same time they can not make everyone happy the reasoning is why bother
i hope not thats a ridiculous stancei dont want to have to crosstrain amarr
you mean like all the injustice and wrongs in the world the world will always have bad things so why would anyone care and try to change things right im sure ghandi mother teresa malcolm x martin luther king louis armstrong and che would agree with you their struggles were all a waste of time lets go ask nelson mandela how that worked out for himwhile i can only dream of being as great as one of the ones above it doesnt mean i will give up on this cause

faction warfare seriously needs an overhaul soonboost the roleplay backgound fix the endless senseless capturetheflag standing factory and add some effects on gameplay in occupied systems eg no docking rights for opposing militia a bit similar to 00 game mechanics its working pretty well thereedit typo
18 months correction at least 18 months before ccp will look into faction warfare fixesupdates thats just wrong i know only a small percentage of people do fw but part of that is because it is still buggyplease ccp fix faction warfare
i dont think its reasonable to take a minimum time spent broken into consideration when looking for what to fix first factional warfare is as close to eves core business as it gets since its about player spaceships blowing each other up therefore it should get more attention than cosmos or indeed incarna which is neither about spaceships nor even about pvpdo want fixes for fw sooner than 18 months from now
vote againstmakes no sense to shift their scurm teams and planning around too much time would be wasted by overhead
fully supported balancingfixing fw and lowsec is doable and easier to achieve than fixing lag eve at minimum needs those two fixed out of sea of issues that should be higher priority than wisid like to remind everyone that we cant start on that in 18 months means that no fixes or balance will come at 18 months but much much later if they start working on stuff in 18 months we likely wont see anything fixed in 2 or 2 and a half years
why doesnt it  new players that just started this game are thrown in faction warfare almost from the start this has some importance only because of that they should work on fw lots of bugs imbalance issues and lots more in fw needs work it wont take months to fix these issues if a team work on this believe me theres lots of veterans in fw from all the races know whats going on and how to fix those imbalance all ccp needs to do  if they dont have the infowhich i dont think thats the case is ask them whats going onmaking the transition to fw less steap that should help i keep hearing i just finished the tutorial  what do i do now  in the militia chat channel for me that means ccp has to work on fw
it makes no sense from the economical  project management point of view switching up development is not as easy as you all like to believe it would result in wasted time and money basicly
i dont give a  about fw so i rather have them work on incarna
i do think there would be a relatively easy fix for fw i have posted about it here and the url is in my sig i know you disagree the details can be read in the thread in my sig which brings us to your second point it does seem the participants cant agree on what changes should happen the minor bug fixes proposed and backlogged by csm will not fix fw i think fixing fw means participants actually engage in and enjoy the fight for occupancy that is what my proposal would do and without too much work but i fear so many have long since given up on occupancy in its current lacking form that few are interested in the topicccp is saying incarna and dust will be here in 18 months i doubt it but if it is here in that time they will have bugs with incarna that will need to be fixed before fw will be addressed incarna is just really like designing a whole new game  only harder as it needs to tie in with eve fixing the bugs will likely take an additional 6 months the changes to fw that i and others request are not that big of a deal we shouldnt have to wait 2 years make the minor changes i and others have requested now and then if they still think they need to do some big overhaul after incarna is out they can but they wont need to if they made the changes i proposed fw would by far be the best pvp in eve those seemingly minor changes would revolutionize eve
i dont give a  about incarna so i rather have them work on fw i dont play this game for walking a guy around like an fps i play this game for srs bsns internet spaceshipsseriously though i think they should let alliances join with a nosovholding stipulation
me go and broke a lance against another windmill
learning skills are used to separate longterm and shortterm players
what theres no problem with learning skills whos complaininghow about ccp starts fixing the actual problems this game has
agree starting with the altposting issue
youre an idiot for even saying that not menioning the fact you dont know how ah even works
if ccp plan on removing learning skills and i dont for a minute think they do then i suugest that they simply remove the books those that have trained the skills get to keep their attribute increases those that havent get to play the game not having to worry about training themnice and simple solution
one solution since everyone says that it detracts noobs from actually experiencing the game because it seems like they need to do learning skills before anything else why not make it so that learning skills can only be attained after 2 million skill pointsafter a player reaches 2 million skill points he can than purchase skill books for learning which he can than decide to choose to learnin the mean time the first 2 million skill points he can spend towards things like a nice ship fittings etcthis way all the old timers still have their attribute advantage all the newbies wont be detracted by ship spinning right away and have a chance to experience the game the depthstrategy to learning skills still remain in the game at no initial cost to newbies the best part of it all is you wouldnt need to reimburse skill points at all to anyone rather you could simply extend the sp learning bonus for new characters just a little morewandering deathstriker

i can be peristent bitch  in case they will not read i am planning high sec suicide ganking of noob stations   to give them right first experience of the eve  u logon undock and your ship goes boom just one day old toons 
yes pleaseccp lets get this done
nonononononono that is absolutely not what this is about again it isnt about getting carebears into lowsec it is about making lowsec better for the people who live there hisec has 6 security systems lowsec has 4 00 just is 00there is plenty of hisec we dont want a gradual falloff where outlaws have an even tougher time outlaws live in lowsec this is about making the game as deep and immersive for outlaws and the lawful folks who want to live there too as it is for the hisec multitude and the 00 empire builders
why would you make it better for people who have already chosen to live in lowsec thats not the objective of the lowsec change at all its about encouraging other players to go there
wait a minute i just thought of somethingif ccp did allow players to buy skillpoints wouldnt that cause the character bazaar to crashi dont buy or sell characters so im not personally affected by this but charactersellers would suddenly have to compete with characters that players could create by buying skillpoints straight from ccpi dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing
it has been said that lotteries are a tax on the stupid and poor i do not care to argue for or against that position however i do think that lotteries have become over represented in the sale subgroup of eve marketplacei would like to see them segregated from the other sale threads so that those inclined to be bamboozled buy in to these instruments can have a place all to their own to find such adds

hate to be the minority here but i invite the complexity that four currencies would bring to the game im all for realism of this idea it would bring an immersive gameplay aspect unique to each empire and as much as i dont like adding skills to the game this is one that i would definitely promote added trade skills for such as racial brokeringthere i said it
thumbs up for the idea but nut for more than one currency
so for those who cannot compete with the pirates the end result is shrinking the playable universe to 14 of the size with the most likely result that 23 empires will become backwaters the online guides recommend against starting interrible idea unless you are a pirate and if you want to get newbies or pve people into 00 then focus on actually making the pvp gameplay fun
supported and nice way of framing it op no new currencies though
i lol at the op cause this wont happen you saw what happened when autopilot broke rancer was camped 247 with some 200 ships so what you are suggesting is have 4 empires completely seperate from each other and have a list of systems heavily camped 247 which would not allow any tradeoh and oursulaert was a trade hub long before dodixie
there is one potential issue with the devs suddenly deciding they need to start playing the game to understand the gamewith no employment history  kill board activity etc they probably have a difficult time making it past major 00 alliancecorp recruiting check listsand therefore prob wouldnt get to enjoy 00 warfare lag in all its gloriesbut then the idea of senior gms racing around with free isk griefing missioning runners and miners in order to pump up their kill board kinda makes me giggle a bit a manly giggle but a giggle none the less
found one that plays 
not supportedignorance is bliss
you grossly overestimate the recruiting standards of both yours and every other alliance 3
we come back to this week long timeframe which is not 30 days also back to the point of same scenario he gets wardecced in that time and his pos is still gone furthermore as people have stated  a pos should be a corporate venture too many 1 man and his alt outfits have towers up  a pos has ceased to be something special im all in favour of making it less easy to maintain one solowell assuming the alt in question brings along a strip waits for the pos to online spends 2 hours anchoring the strip onlines it waits the 24 hours for its cycle to complete scoops the pos and its mods and no one else from the corp notices this happening or decides to read the notification that your tower is being stripped or the mailbox full of tower low on resources mailsi say tough luck24 hours of the tower moaning about being low fuel plus 24 hours for the strip to complete its cycle provides a reasonable timescale to my mindok the whole purpose of this proposal was to provide a mechanic to remove offline towers without having to attack them or declare war on the corporation so if you want tack having to wardec them on top of the other requirements suggested why not just amalgamate your suggestion re pos hitting structure rendering it unanchorable without any of the suggestions ive madeas to warning again the activation of the strip sends a notification to the corporationi think though that youre missing the main thrust of the argument here  this is a corporation that has left its multimillion isk investment abandoned in space theyve ignored 24 hours worth of warnings that their time and effort in putting up this structure is about to be rendered moot in my opinion so is being able to set up massive expensive structures in space and just leave them floating secure in the knowledge that if you leave eve for a month that the tower will still be there cause wardeccing them and assembling a fleet to take out an offline large tower is too much effort for minimal reward your pos is at risk if you do not maintain the fuel bay in a proper and timely manner
stripaduwhatever  not supportedstealingremoving a tower is a group effort now and should remain so i would support making offline towers unanchorable once they hit a certain percentage of shieldsarmorsructure though
as soon as pos goes offline and all structures are destroyed you get an option to force unanchor the tower imo that should take about 24 hours and the owner would get a notification about itif nobody shows up in those 24 hours the tower is yoursif you would rather have the mods than the tower youd still need to blow up the tower
i like this approach better than the original proposal i would add one item for the high sec poss any high sec pos that is unfueled for 120 days gets reclaimed by concord and is removedahs
supported if only to clean out all the abandoned towers in wspace
yesi posted one word and made one typo grand
the community team tossed this thread over to me since its pretty topical to what i do they read and forward everything that is pertinent to the appropriate departments as you can imagine and keep an eye out on the biggies for positive and negative player opinions just because theres no dev actively posting in a thread it doesnt mean they havent seen it or it doesnt go into a special report prepared by the community team thats sent to the dev team in their capacity as advocates of your voices this happens a lot on individual features and things like plexbefore i dip into the below point i do want to say that although many of you wont believe me the dev team does take the csm very seriously we do have a history of insertingreprioritizing things based off of their input with a heartfelt attempt to find other ways to address the technically impossible suggestionsissues more will be said on this in the near future since its of obvious concern to players here so by all means dont take the pr guys word for itduring the first csm we invited the nyt and wired and a few other publications out to the csm to check things out there was also a camera crew from europe that mostly followed around their local hero rep but also did a feature on the whole thing for their documentary we set up a round robin time post meetings and predinner for any questions they may have it really helped them to understand the varied nature of the player base some of the politics that went into the summit itself and rounded out the coverage post meeting we offered up contact information assuming the csm members themselves signed off on it to all our media contacts and offered to help arrange interviews typically for the chairman firstfor each csm after that weve tried reaching out to new outlets mostly gaming to bring them over unfortunately scheduling interest and cost of traveling and some not allowing us to pay have prevented journalists from attending each one for each csm though we have done outreach and tried to help set up interviews again with the permission of each csm member this has been an ongoing effortpc gamer sent out josh augustine to the csm 4 and he did do a whole feature on it in pc gamer so you are right there while many think that the csm is just a pr stunt it wasnt dreamed up in my mind or the collective minds of marketing the select few witchdoctors who do pr for eve purposefully take every precaution to paint the csm as it actually exists not blowing its power out of proportion being honest about it in the early stages still trying to find its legitimacy amongst the player base which still happens now being transparent about the voting numbers and setting up interviews directly with csm members without interfering or editing their responses or demanding that we as developers get equal response time hence it doesnt get as much press as if we actually did make it into a pr stunt
contd from abovefor those csms that werent attended by press we did a wrapup for the press like fanfest who were interested in attending but couldnt providing pictures meeting minutes access to our dev team etc in the leadin to each subsequent one we do similar outreach and summaries as wellthe csm 5 is no different we did outreach before and we stand ready to put any interested press in touch with the csm members directly if we are contacted by them its one of the perks and responsibilities of their elected positions and one of our duties in supporting this part of eve onlineagain we take efforts not to censor the csm in the press because we do feel that its another step in them forging their own legitimacy with the rest of the player base and to a certain degree in gamingdom as wellhope that clarifies things if not just askcomment
i dont doubt that but from the decisionmakers we have little more than lip servicewhat is your definition of stakeholder status
i dont want to hijack this issue since i think its an important one so a quick digression herestakeholder statusif you are a stakeholder it means that your position has a representative interest in the issuefeature and that your input carries weight when it comes to refining it and following its development while not necessarily being part of the development team who is designing and coding the feature i am sure development has a much stricter definition of it but this is my basic understandingfor instance i have been a stakeholder in a few things one of which was the redo of the ccpgamescom website for that there was also stakeholders from hr and operations and web in most cases each issuefeature has multiple stakeholdersbeing a stakeholder does not mean an automatic push through of your priorities however i know from personal experience im sure you are asking because the csm was recently elevated to stakeholder status in terms of eve development meaning that their recommendations bear similar weight to those from other departments in the company and are judged accordingly such as marketing also as i said above it doesnt mean automatic implementation of a wish list but it does mean a seat around the table where all wish lists are prioritized hope that clarifies itanother interesting shift in the recent csm not mentioned often is that we are showing them a lot more of what we have planned going forward some people ive talked to outside of ccp consider this a serious dangerous gamble but we feel its necessary to get the dialogue we need from a more informed csm this includes technological dependencies plans for growth of features etc before we didnt let them that far into our future plans i was at the first one but that evolved over time to a more open dialogue with them
um that is painting a very twisted picture creating the impression that a process stakeholder is the same as csm or the stakeholder function advertised for the csm not to mention this is getting a little close to backpedalling after confusing the stage a little bit peither way i doubt many people are tripping over the csm concept or definition but over some other thingsvery notable is how on a decision level the csm in any function is basically gimped since all processes are already committed on and the minutes make very clear that this is something that will basically never be compromised on i doubt that is conscious decision but think of it for a moment on a basic level you are asking for feedback and input on upcoming cycles but all those are set in stone tablets already by the time the csm arrivesmost notable however is how on an executive level there is a reliance on definitions and methods which are not just giving secondary returns but are not based on common definitions and suffer from what you could call a translation gap excellence has nothing to do with code you are not selling a game in a supermarket you are selling an experience the experience is defined through principles of concept and design by the emotional link customers make now it is visible that at the top ccp doesnt even think of eve or their company this way that has some pretty disappointing consequences players want to believe this is inherent to this emotional link it is why in a market like this with a product like this people do not vote with their feet and why in times like these they go ever more quiet on the main forums the reason eve and everything around it is so unique and powerful is because once upon a time long ago a bunch of people got together and got to work with and on a shared emotional connectionbecause of that eve and all around it is so strong that it stands seperate as its own mmo and even platform type this is why unlike other mmos players of eve can so easily go through more then one mmorpg subscriber addiction curves yet now it is visible that while players have and desperately try to maintain the primary element that emotional link we all go through the ups and downs with it and there you see execs in those minutes and on facebook making it clear that this emotional connection that made everything possible has zero meaning because metrics that are only secondary business variables have become dogmaps do you not see that it is rather significant that for a csm 1 you invite press but for a csm 5 with stakeholder advertising you just sit back and wait to see if press shows upi mean eve is a game that according to one of the recent interviews with a producer attracts smart people dont you think they read these things and then ask questions to themselves and others
manifest while i appreciate your reply i think youre completely missing the ops point aerilis wasnt talking about getting the csm into the press for the purposes of promoting the process or the game he was talking about getting the csm into the press as a specific direct attack on ccp trying to use their experiences as a way of making ccp look bad making it look like your companys priorities are destroying the game in other words not the sort of press that you get from an information handout and qa organized by ccp i dont think its a very good strategy but its what he had in mind so while what you do is good for the process it bears very little resemblance to the topic of this thread
what else can be said then geez many people here and on everelated forums are convinced that the developers are doing a wonderfull job but the management s up the planning and assignments bigtime by drawing the wrong assumptions from their numbers and figures just see nathans pleacomment in the minutes and distributing all priorities at the wrong placeseve is by far the most complex and most ambituous as well as most promising spacemmo if not mmo overall out there and the decision to basically leave eve running on idlemode for at least 15 years is putting your flagship to a dangerous risk there especially since people have seen forthcoming this whole thing but were put down with yet again broken and forgotten promises
it also sounds like ccp has its priorities a little skewed from the minutesif most of the players want improvments and upgrades to existing systems and all ccp seems interested in incarna and the bloody rtsfps interaction with eve take a hint make dust a separate game set in the same universe but dont tie it in directly with the mmo
unfortunatly ccps actions contridict your statementsupporting the op some gaming magazine coverage of how this game is becoming more and more broken might be what is needed as a wakeup call to the devs
many people are concerned about the direction of eve myself includedwhile some of us wish priority were evenly split or more focused on a backward maintenanceimprovementbalancing of the game we have vs future additionsother games this thread reeks of cutting off your nose in spite of your facewhen ccp doessays something i dont like and i decide to hit the forums my personal goal in coming to the forums is to try and convey my concerns to the people at ccp who matter and hope they take that under advisementwhat op suggests is that if they wont listen well hit em where it hurts while its not only a juvenile approach to the issue if you were successful which even if ign or someone writes up a ccp shifts gears article you wont be successful in the way you think you want to bewhere was i  if you were successful what do you think the future repercussions would be for the csm and further playerccp relationships i hate people that respond to those of us upset with ccps admission of priorities with well if you dont like it leave and while i think that it is a simplistic response to most threads it does have merit in that if you really are that mad that you think you need to strike out at them with any and all channels available to you youve probably lost focus and need to quit playing pushing the csm to make some type of media rage about ccp being open with their future plans is  shooting yourself in the footwhat do you think the article will read ccp opens player council to make players a part of the processccp makes business decision and doesnt do exactly what players want frjewpofjkl ccp is tereibalperhaps thats what op wants however at best a troll at worst he has ulterior motives being a part of the process having them share their plans with us openly is a privilege for us and a bit of a gamble for ccp while i may come to the forums and call nathan a hypocrite for stating he has a commitment to excellence and then stating 18months to review crap we want done yesterday that doesnt mean that i dont at the very least appreciate the openness in them sharing those pieces of information with us thanks to the ccp guy for responding and to all the devs that respond just because we are upset with your managements priorities doesnt mean we arent happy that there arent ccp guys that really try to make the game as good as they can every day i bet wed be surprised just how many sympathized with us on some of these issues and fix the game so i can pvp
my motives arent revenge im not looking for a direct attack or to cause harm to ccp but i dont know how else the playerbase can get its message across the csm literally looked hilmar right in the eye and said we dont like what youre doing with eve you lied to us about your commitment to excellence you lied to us about the role of the csm and hilmar just shrugged and denied it gd is flooded with players voicing their opinions about what a bad decision ccp is making i really dont know how else to get this message acrossand yes im sure most of the handson devs the people actually making the content and the game we love and enjoy can sympathize with the concerns of the playerbase its just the upper level guys seem to only care about money and have no qualms about lying to their most loyal customers to get it we need to make them understand that we are the source of their income we are their greatest recruitment asset when it comes to new subs ive convinced so many people to try eve and quite a few have subbed and are playing at this moment and it is our opinions and concerns that should matter not some ruthless corporate market modelplease ccp dont turn into cryptic studios
i know alot of people are pretty upset with hilmars comments and saying sorry wont fix it we want fixes to eve this news is spreading fast in the player base and alot of people feel annoyed this should be a sign to fix eve then work on dust you guys think you get all your new customers and from shiny toys what happens when the game is so ed that it wont work and no one wants to play it you are heading down a bad road and could easily fix this instead of producing things like eve gate and other failed ideas just do the right thing and listen to the people who are the only reason you all have jobs
its all fine and dandy that ccp cares about the csm and all that jazzbut the core of the problem is that ccp is tied up for 18 months making features that the community isnt that enthusiastic of the csm is just a pawn in the players vs ccp metagame for us as current players fixes to the current game far outweigh some vague future feature
i cant help but wonder if this wasnt influenced by the similar suggestion i made over in jita speakers that being saidi read it less as a direct attack on ccp and more a direct wakeup call for ccp there are several injokes right now thatve existed for years when theres any patch especially a big one set a long train skill not because long train skills are nifty but because ccp is probably going to break something and then use us as beta testers to try to figure out wtf they did from deleting bootini to totally undoing the need for speed with crushing fleet lag in dominion much of the playerbase has gotten used to the facts that ccps development schedule is artificially rushed and leads to halfbaked products being pushed out the door simply because theyre married to a sixmonthsordie schedule instead of a wellreleaseitwhenitsready schedule and there are many many minor issues that dont require a massive scrum team fix a few numers in the database for rockets damage profile etc that would at least show that ccp was aware of the playerbases legitimate complaints and was willing to work on fixing them asap even if it would take some time to work through the backlog instead we see from ccp that they consider the game to be stabilityperformance wise better than ever its not instead we see from ccp that theyll use massive fleet battles with titans and motherships blasting away to make the trailers to their expansions when battles like that have become virtually unplayable because of their expansions instead we see that while ccp was telling us that their wod team wouldnt take away from eve that their resources have been redirected to wod and dust and those of us who want the modify and cancel buttons on the trade interface to be moved apart finally or gasp to actually be able to have the same kind of fights we were having before dominion are simply out of luck for the next 15 to 2 years the idea isnt to hurt ccp at all its to get something negative pr bad word of mouth whatever to pierce the insulating and selfaugmenting cocoon that seems to have enveloped the real decision makers at ccp because seriously when the entire csm tells them that the game is doing worse than it has before and its kluged together bits are grinding like a machine with sand in the gears and weve long since lost excellence in exchange for new but not really polished content and the response is nah things are better than everwell there needs to be some sort of wakeup call or theyll keep sleepwalking at this point i wouldnt advise anybody new to get into eve maybe in 2 years time who knows but perhaps more importantly even though i love the wod source material and ip i will not sign up for that game when it goes live because at this point i dont have faith that ccp will manage that game properly either and ill tell the same thing to folks thinking about playing that game that i tell to people whore thinking of playing eve its a great concept but ccp is unable or unwilling to do the work required to make it work so yah dont hurt ccp but do get this into the news so that someone in a position of power at ccp will realize that a game about space battles and playerdriven content where big space battles that players use to define the content are unplayable slide shows is a bad thing supported
youll need this too but you seem to have missed the real problemedit added a hint
i didnt put enough text to that point but i did understand itperhaps not quite explicitly saying so and giving you the impression that i didnt i was trying to speak to that point when i was relaying that pr will continue to help match csm member to journalist from a detached standpoint whether the csm is made up of all peaceful intergalactic ambassadors or tom zareks i personally agree with you that the tactic wouldnt be a good strategy and ultimate selfdefeating but that certainly doesnt mean that ccp should herd the csm or gag them from expressing their opinionsthe differing personalities and the issues they represent are one major contributor to what makes the csm compelling from a journalistic standpoint and frankly lends credence to its representative nature
you are jedi with the photoshoppery using it to great effect i actually noticed the blue bar thing you point out when i made the post i believe theres a reason for that this section of the site is meant to help identify distill and strengthen player issues to be raised by the csm but in the context of player discussion hence the devs typically steer clear from commenting here except for comm team moderation i believeso as not to taint opinion sidetrack commentary obfuscate etc your next statement will probably be that more devs need to be more active in other parts of the forums and engaged in dialog there youre right but as i mentioned before they do pay attention to the forums more than they have the bandwidth to respond to themthanks to special reports and forwarded threads from the community team trying to find the right mix is toughas for me posting here i just saw an opportunity to clarify the pr stunt thing since someone asked i might even get spanked by wrangler for doing so i say this not to make light of current unrest seriously id at least fit tech 2 give me some credit
i cannot in any way support the op apart from the fact that destroying the village in order to save it has never been a smart move its very disrespectful to some very hardworking and dedicated people at ccpmanifest thanks for posting i do hope you activated your armor testicle hardener iis before doing so  though i would not recommend that you overheat themgoing forward i would hope that the relationship between the players and csm and ccp is defined by increasing amounts oftransparency  so we see the effects of player input on backlog prioritizationcommunication  so that quick iteration between ccp and csm with input from player experts results in leaner easier to implement and more useful versions of current proposals in the csm backlogprocess  so that csms ability to act as a proper stakeholder is not crippled by the fact that we are not onsite in icelandand while we are at it gentlepeople  criticizing ccp is fine i have been known to indulge in it myself but raging invective only ensures your message is ignored a single cogent well argued post is worth a thousand ccp sux
actually no i tend to thing that the devs not short for developers spend entirely too much time moderating this forum i especially like when yall troll a thread by locking it for trolling suavebut i digress my mspaintjob was not sufficiently specific i was reflecting that the 2000 posts about development standards had been entirely ignored yet 3 posts about bad press was worthy of ccpemployed interaction applauds
well there is another way to protest and open a few eyes without having to go directly to the press hold a 24hr or whatever amount blackout for thirdparty eve support websites the likes of evecentral eve survival evemon etc etc whether anyone can organize it and pull this off it wont be easy but its important to communicate the blackout plans both the reasoning and schedule in advance so that users wont be caught offguardthat way you get pr with the public looking curiously on wtf in going on over there sort of thing rather than a direct smear and at the same time show the public the perception of solid solidarity amongst the eve community as they say any type of pr is good pr
yeah i read this as just another whine threadyou claim ccp does not listen to you or hear your voice which is just flat out demonstrateably wrong the csm has voiced concerns and the players have voiced their concerns over and over again has ccp locked all these threads and declared you cannot talk about that no has ccp gagged the csm or fired them all or dissolved the csm so they cannot speak their mind noso you have been heard and anymore whining that your opinion hasnt been heard is simply that  a whinenow what you are really upset over is the fact that after the csm voiced their opinion ccp has not followed their advice i dont really see how you can change ccps path at this moment they have pulled a lot of people from eveonline to work on dust514 and wod when you develop new games you are always short on cash and people so how is ccp supposed to get cashpeople to work on eve nowhow about this are you willing to pay 5 more per subscription per month in order for ccp to hire a new team dedicated to eve in the 18 months interim before dust514 comes outany proposal simply demanding that ccp fixes stuff without suggesting a way for ccp to fund said activities is just a whine and not constructive we have heard you already whining to news media or bashing ccp will not help anything
its also something that hasnt been advocated by this proposal publicizing ccps failure to tend to issues within the game while they focus on content 1 years down the road is not disrespectful of anybodyyouve forgotten one without which all yours are meaningless effectivenessall the transparency communication and efficiency of process are well and good but when ccp responds to the fact that there are major bugs that need to be fixed with nah were not even going to start looking at them for a year and a half at least then youve accomplished nothing if your only goal is a conversation and not impact then we can replace the csm with a politely worded letter 1 as already evinced ccp is more than willing to handwave away multiple cogent well throught out arguments posts and proposals 2 which gets to the fact that if a significant portion of ccps customer base is responding with raging invective that alone should be a good clue to ccp that theyre doing something wrong many of our customers are furious at us but it doesnt matter because theyre not making good arguments is hardly a effective response
i still find it amusing that companies feel that they can control information among their customers and also that this is a positive thing one of ccps strengths has been its interaction with the customer base and rejection of this line of thinking even though we have suffered setbacks as ccp has grown up into the much larger operation it is today the communication lines are still visible i think that sharing information and thoughts on the future is far from risky that it is in fact healthywhat is really risky is uncontrolled or poorly controlled growth and the resulting lack of focus that often comes when a company grows too quickly this is where the playerbase is genuinely concerned eve has a ridiculous amount of potential and is one of the only mmos to have maintained slow steady growth over several years some of ccps customers fear that caution has been set aside that too much has been bit off with the dual projects of incarna and dust and that this is risking the entire shared dream ccp has put itself in a hard place because they cant drop projects as this would be financial ruin and they obviously cant simultaneously maintain a strong focus on eve whether this is due to poor resource management or actual need on other projects only ccp management knows and it is mostly irrelevantthe bottom line is even if ccp thinks that they can pull off incarna and dust while preserving the shared dream of eve many customers resent that they would even risk it in the first place others just carry on and hope but all eyes are watching because there is a lot invested in this place from both player and developer alike
must be troll i think the suggestion in all of these whine threads is that ccp is devoting too much resource into things the current subscribers dont want like a first person shooter game and a virtual reality game at the expense of things they do want like improvements to current spaceship combat game
no the claim is that ccp has heard the facts and handwaved them away for a number of reasons you should be a detective thats your argument really ccp has decided to strip vital resources from eve leave glaring bugs unfixed and shaft the eve playerbase and the eve playerbase should be fine with that because ccp is doing that so it can make other noneve products how about this tomorrow ccp decides to simply shut down the servers for eve and just use 100 of your subscription money to fund dust and not reimburse you a single penny thats cool right because i mean how else are they going to fully fund their new projects would you whine about that eh eh
make no mistake yes it has the goal is a wakeup call but the method is badmouthing eve and ccp in the gaming press thats a dangerous game and i have zero faith in our ability to play it as deftly as it would need to be played to work unless a couple bitter vets off scrapheap are secretly ign reporters were relying on people who have no horse in this race to report on drama in a way that exactly serves our purposes in order for this to work it has to be seen as damning by ccp management to the point where it convinces them to change their ways without damaging eve in the minds of the potential subscribers who the article is written for thats not just a dangerous game id wager that its actively impossible given the choice between letting eve slowly fall apart or hastening the process ill let it be trying to bring the gaming press into this dispute is playing with fire  have no doubt about that dont do it unless you know exactly what youre trying to do and unless you know that you can succeed at doing it i dont think that you or i or anyone on the csm does know those things it sounds nice in theory to call in some big guns and pierce the illusions of ccps management but it will not work out that neatly in real life there is a price to be paid for such tactics and it is eve itself that will pay it i dont think itll be worthwhile never forget that our goal here is to fix eve not to break it dont do anything unless you think that youre furthering that goal
the op actually went on to specifically clarify my motives arent revenge im not looking for a direct attack or to cause harm to ccp but i dont know how else the playerbase can get its message acrosspeople can continue to act as if this is about destroyinghurtingwhatevering ccp but its not you may argue that it would have negative sideeffects but thats not what its aboutthis is not nuke it from orbit its the only way to be sure the method was stating the truth and facts about whats going on in the gaming press if the facts are so damaging to ccp then the course of action isnt to worry that they might be publicized but fix the problems at hand thats a false dichotomy for instance such articles might turn off some subscribers but when ccp fixes things new articles about how things are working might attract more subscribers than were lost or ccp wakes up and fixes things while some potential subscribers are turned off to the game but not enough to seriously damage cash flow or ccp when contacted by the times or whoever snaps out of their somnambulism and the article is ccp has been resistent to fixing major bugs in their game as their attention has been split but their playerrepresentative council the csm has convinced them to rededicate themselves to the functionality of the game and so on things we know for a fact that also arent furthering that goal so far posting to the forums with constructive criticism and well thought out arguments and proposals subscribers not resubbing the csm telling ccp what the problems are and suggesting fixes what course of action would you suggest to change how things are going before the 1218 month timeframe what guarantees could you offer that at the 18 month mark ccp doesnt decide to do something else after all if their customers are willing to keep paying for a broken game that ccp admits it wont be fixing for years why not develop a new product after dust and wod or why not invest dev resources in the new games themselves after all all those damn eve players whove stuck around are already hooked on the game like junkies or something and they need to make sure that wod and dust are polished and have continually polished and engaging content at least for the first year or twowhile insanity may or may not be doing the same thing over and over and expecting a new result futility probably can safely be defined that way
if i believed for one second that csm is useful i would consider myself ed word starts with reedited because of all this 
dear sweet finnagain never change you work so hard for our entertainment
i take it from your response that you have no actual substantive answer to your errors that i pointed out if you do provide it please the nonsense in your last post is or should be beneath you
oh boy yes it is once the  is boiling good luck trying to get it cold again youre making the mistake of taking apart cause and effect and completely ignore that getting the press on your side is never ever going to work like you expected but instead will develop a life on its own yes ccp at least the higherups need a wakingcall maybe even some serious shaking to get back to conciousness but taking them and dropping them out of the hatch without a spacesuit isnt going to work as you intended you basically missed what the whole t20incident gave ccp and eve for a reputation that happened 4 years ago and is still raising its ugly head whenever something doesnt work quite as smooth as it should the attention was well deserved back then and it may be again today but youre demanding to risk more here then you realizescreaming for the inquisition never yielded a positive result
im going to contact the press and complain that i havent gotten my csm forum tag ingame medal and free game time yet this is a serious breach of justice
please seriously lets drop the strawman nobody at all in this thread has advocated trying to ruin ccp over this even a string of negative articles would most likely not ruin ccp over this lets keep this in perspective if you have to argue against a proposal that nobody has made its a good indicator that the proposal that has been made is pretty solid and no letting ccp get an outside point of view and not oh those playerswhogotelectedarecomplaining might be a wakeup call it wouldnt be analogous to death by asphyxiation and again the tacit assumption underlying such an argument is that the facts themselves are so damaging to ccp that merely reporting on them would be massively detrimental if thats true its an argument for why ccp must be jolted into fixing them asap and not why we should hope that they dont see the light of day in wider circulation you just changed the subject from the fact that do nothing or ruin ccp is a false dichotmy in any case no i didnt miss anything about the t20 scandal but now your argument seems to be that it was right for ccp to try to cover it up because of how damaging the bad press might have been surely that isnt what you mean though and whether its a cheating dev or ignoring glaring bugs in an established game in order to devote resources to new games the answer should be to fix the problems in a transparent manner rather than sweeping them under the rug lest they provide bad pr sure now please quote anybody in this thread whos called for an inquisition and not simply the facts to be more widely publicized in order to jolt ccps management out of their cocoon and ill ask you the same question that you seem to have skipped over what course of action would you advise then weve seen that cogent arguments dont work that massive player support for excellence doesnt work that players dropping their subscriptions over the years due to bugs doesnt work that the csm going to ccp and explaining the problems and suggesting fixes doesnt work okay so whats your suggestion

i agree
gypsios excellent post outlined the problem the solution is also viableone observationa lot of the people who are championing soks opinion also expressed their concern on the potential imbalance of lst on dedicated logistics ships once they are modified do they realize that soks suggestion to include an extra med slot or two on existing shield tanking battleships would introduce more balance headaches than reducing the cpu requirements of lst for balancing the reduction of cpu requirements you would just have to reduce the cpu capacity of two logistics by a proportional amount balancing the extra slots increase however would be far more difficultedit i support this proposal
i still dont know what you guys expect a lowering of lst cpu needs to achieve but more battleship shield rr gangs will not be it
thread should have stopped here tbh
not supported for the simple reason that its pointless giving a useless ship a role if you dont also give the player base the ability to build themhowever i do agree the model is very good and would support a proposal to get the same model makersdesigner to go through and redesign some of the older ship models
1 fix all the clicking there is way to much bull clicking in this game when i am crushing ore it shouldnt ask me what installation i want to use seeing as its the only one capable of doing it pi really create link create route route product nice waste of my time there2 cloaked system campers index falls everyday on its own i dont need help from some ass clown with nothing better to do than sit cloaked in system all day3 invention waht a load of crap 30 days to copy obolisk bpo 6 days to invent and it hasnt worked the last 4 times off 2 bpos 8 copies down the crapper4 hulkagedden holy  a sponsered event to kill ships in high sec and they all get paid to do it from insurince4 why can we pull ore from the corp hanger for compression but not the ore hold5 it carriers fighters and bombers both are manned craft now but it cant carry a frigate with someone in it6 new space there needs to be a resone for some of these huge allainces to leave some of the 00 space so the littler corps can move down the there  give us a brake our little 10 man corp has to pay a rediculous rent to stay in a system that we dont have full rights in ie moon mins plexs shuffle the moon minerals around a little or add them to wh space so smaller corps can have there own little part to call home
how ing dare anyone out there make fun of ccp after all theyve done for youthey made factional warfare they made wormholes they made ing planetry interactiona developer turned out to be a cheater and now theyre trying to finish dust all you people care about is playing eve and having funthey are human what you dont realize is that they are making you all these games and all you do is write a bunch of crap about themthey havent released a good expansion in years their motto is we care more we work harder for a reason because all you people want is more moremore more moreleave them alone you are lucky they even made eve for you bastardsleave ccp alonepleasedierdra vaal talked about excellence and said if ccp was a excellent they wouldve pulled it off no matter whatspeaking of excellence when is it excellent to publicly bash someone who is going through a hard timeleave ccp alone please leave crowd control productions aloneright nowi mean itanyone that has a problem with them you deal with me because they are not well right nowleave them alone
not supporting the current course of ccpintroducing bugs is sad but happens  were all humannot fixing them as soon as possible and instead introducing more content that will have bugs as well is wrongyou dont correct one mistake by making anotherin 18 months when incarna andor dust will be released there will be the next projectexpansion on the horizon and new reasons to say well just do this then well get back to fixing stuff promisedo it now do it rightone thing you should learn early when developing software is leblancs law later equals neverso please stop hoping you will have time later
heres an ideaspend less money on advertising and marketing and more on fixing the bloody gamelet the pilots advertise for youits how i found this game word of mouthi can tell you this much the only reason you guys got people here who have played for years is because of loyalty over the spirituniqueness of eve not for the frakking new features i guarantee it
you fail to consider that ccpeve has been around for many many yearsthe amount of very basic reproducible bugs not even considering more complex issues like fleet lag is staggering for such a mature product ccp has stated that devoting even a minimal amount of resources to this problem is out of the questionwith this in mind what grounds do you have to tell the player base to stop whining and support ccp
developing eve is ccps job i get up in the morning and go to my job and in return i recieve a paycheck if i did my job halfassed i would be fired end of storyccp however gets paid roughly 15 per account per month regardless of how ed up theyre most recent efforts and i use that term loosly have been were the boss here people and our employees are drinking on the job and stealing from the supply closet time to put the hammer down and demand ccp quit ing around and follow through with their promises
sort out afs and make bos worth their while first please
they need to make some new capitals or at least sub caps like the orca this game is in need of some serious anti small ship caps a gang of 5 recons can hold down a carrier forever and kill its drones and or fighters easy had it done to me and done it to otheres get a sub cap that has rof bounus for large short range guns make a real battle ship secondly make a capital mining ship that really mines not crunches ore make it a t2 version of orca or rouq park it in siege in a belt give a good range and yield bounus for strips it would be great for mining and a target since it would have to be deployed in sige mode to mine
sense and logic has been put aside for at least 18 months havent you heard
there are enough ships already ccp should just get to balancing themand yeah  incarna its messing up the game completely and its not even on the horizon
ccp new ships incarnafix whats broken first
supporting wat is obviously the best idea eve needs new ships 10 years from now we cant be at the same ones
agreed all of you saying we have enough ships you missed the point hes is talking about hulls if you havent noticed most of the ships in eve are the same ships with different paint jobs
i have only done a little research on this but as i play eve almost everyday and i have been for almost 2 years now i would like to propose that ccp implement several points in high traffic areas maybe where players can meet and fight against each other in a concord sanctioned battle the players would be able to gamble with isk items or just for bragging rights they would bring their own ship fitted how they like to the battle and would lose their ship or destroy their opponents ship resulting in a recorded kill this isnt meant to be a virtual battle as i have read about in the forums instead as i stated it would be a willing agreement between 2 or more players where wagers could be placed and other pilots could gamble on as well or just show up to watch other details would be that only parties that enter into this agreement can interact this means no third party join in at the last second to help there friend by repping hisher shields or otherwise turn the tide of the battle and perhaps the battle arena itself could take place in a pos shield type arena preventing either one from running and giving spectators a boundary from where they can watch the fight and as i mentioned before place bets on either side thoughts and suggestions are welcomed and if this forum allows it i will update the details and give credit to the person responsible for any new ideas thanks for reading and as alwaysfly safe
i have posted this idea several times not as some ccp spawned thing but as a really really expensive really really big thing carebears build and control permanently thusly i cant support
no go on the test server
get a bunch of guys into 00 bubble them and there you go you have an arenaits a sandbox just diy its perfectly possible and no one is stopping you
fair enough was just a suggestion and i wanted to see how you feel about it and i agree there is more important thigs to take care of before that
sweet by the way whats the name of your dev account
pretty self explanitory here the orca is a fabulous mining support vessel but only can specialty haul for one of the three types of raw material it helps gather its only logical that the ore hold also be eligible to store ice and gas
have you tried to put ice blocks in the hold cause i am sure last time i did ice mining they went in that hold
ice can be moved to the ore hold i thinkgas cantbut if i was wrong and it has been a while since ive ice mined id like it to be sothats the whole reason of the ore hold isntgranted its not really ore but the point is storage of raw materials for processing amirite
gah ice may indeed be allowed i just finished a massive gas harvesting kick and it was rather frustrating to not be able to bring it all out properlywe could use a bottling system for gas to be compressed via the rorqual but im not holding my breath
this is just a shot in the dark but i think its a good starting point for this idea as we all know 00 is the main arena for largescale pvp this is not to say that large fights cant occur in lowsec or highsec but it means that large battles are much more likely to happen in 00 and since they are there should be a system in place to provide a boost to one of the highly prized aspect of this game which affects everyone in it ccp have changed how sovereignty evolves and changes hands which is fine but now they need to do something to stop the lag that is caused by largescale pvp my proposal would be to create some way to have the eve server automatically reinforce a system or systems around a large group of people moving through 00 an example would be if there were say a 150 member fleet jumping into a system that system should be reinforced automatically and then the surrounding systems should be reinforced to be ready for the fleet to move into them if they did jump to them one problem of this plan would be if they went through a jump bridge or a jump portal i will admit to you right now that i dont know anything about gaming design or server managment at all so i do not even know if this is even possible however if there is a way to do it it should be done and i can tell just by looking at the map ingame when there is a large group of people moving around in 00 and asking ccp to reinforce a system or group of systems before a battle is very inefficient and against the basic rules of the game where battles anywhere should be able to happen without monsterous amounts of lag or manual beggin for reinforcement by gms i again stress that i do not know a much about how this game operates and what the server is capable of doing but i think that this is a valuable idea that should be discussed and debated by all marund
funfact reinforcement happens during downtimes for a reason
also something should be added to make your space in 00 a little safe with sov 5 you should get benifits like maybe npc patrols scouts or them dinky gate guns like in low sec nothing huge but an advance warning you give us super cap facilities at sov 1 but nothing at 5oh and cyno jammer should come before cyno gen helps secure the system for the miners and builders
giving support knowing its not possible
youve effectively missed the whole point of fw while i agree that fw should be fixed i cant support your proposal
in general i hate having to fit a probe launcher on my ship to look for fights thats why i dont go in wormholes i tend to see things the opposite i wish the fw plexes just appeared on the overview so we didnt have to scan them down its just another way ccp wants us to pvp in gimped ships if we want to fight for occupancy fit a probe launcher fit some pve mods to fight rats that are in occupancy plexes etc this is why its a rare bird that fights for occupancy in fw i think the missions are pretty decently balanced they are close to high sec level 4s but they should be equal to them but if they wanted to boost the fw missions i wish they would include more fw exclusive items like they did with apoc 15 or at least give some of the items they gave us a boost things like amarr armor plates are worthless
not supported 1 mission beacons on overview is invitation for fights thats the whole point2 having fw missions on overview keeps carebears from over fishing them
really this is some bull honky our corp is small and we bust our asses to get our indexs up to 45 we rent space where ever we can and at the moment we are in a tuff place due to la differences  i am to stupid to learn another onenow comes along the asshat that wants to sit afk in our system cloaked all day for a week what the hell are we supposed to do cant mine tried that hotdrop rouq hulks all dead cant rat pinned in belt until his buddies arrive dead again so now we dont know if the guy is there or not we just know he is in the system we can return the favor but there is no real threat from us to them sure we have a carrier or 2 but the minute we do it to them there whole allaince is going to camp and  us all daythere needs to be a limit on how long someone can remain cloaked or a sov structure that alows us to find them or small corps like ours arent going to make it
i agree delete local
this and op get out of 00 if you cant deal with one person
read closely what it says before you comment its not the 1 person that worries me its the fleet he cynos ontop of me reading is fun
gee i dont know maybe its because it takes a more than a few people to secure 00 sovtry several large corporations ehmaybe your not quite ready for 00 maybe you should start working on getting strongerbetter organized and less complaining about your shortcomingswelcome to eve online 00 warfare dont like it leave its not supposed to be easy
so when hes there ignore him and do nothing dont even think about trying to communicate with him and absolutely dont respond to any smacktalka day or two of no action no kills no fun and hell bugger off and take his fleet with him sure you might have to suffer not being able to ratmine for the same time period but thats better than losing shipsif you know you cant fight the opponent on his terms dont
lania thank you for the intelligent response i guess that is all we can do for now that and camp there systems
everything in your post is just wrong including your signature i actually have glasses and can read that text
sids is not funny man its just not funny how dare you make dead baby jokes on the forumoh lol wait wrong sids
posting this twice does not make it look any better
how does this aid lowsec in any shape or formsorry this makes no sense apart from making carebears have safe poss no
indy yep im aware of those sites and run them often i am thinking more along the lines of a npc factions shooting at eachother and the ability to help one side or the other with even greater standings gainloss
since when is eve all about fair fights
reasonable easy go for it
eta on this simple fix 1824 months
sorry pressed wrong button meant to post in a topic but accidentally made a new one can a mod handle this
thread closed as ops request
pi is only brought to the game because ccp wanted to get rid of npc sell orders for pos fuel and modules any proposition about expanding pi to be more interesting time consuming or complicated is against everything that eve was and hopefully still is for the last 7 years  a pvp based space exploration gamenot supported
fonts were talked about at the last csm summit this june it is on friday at 1330 i have the section quoted below if you dont wish to go to the link it is a big pdf fileso we may see a new font before the end of the year which would mean in the winter expansion one thing to consider it is a new font they mention nothing of scaling so we shall see what happens in addition note that they are not allowing the choice of font lets just hope that whoever they have is more competent at designing a legible font then the last one
i have to agree with the above and say that this action by ccp and csm has soured me on this game
ccp suggested that csm work more with players to draft a wellsupported vision for low sec then submit a foundation story to ccp as a proposal that reflects that visionin regard to this i will put my limited vision to the task i think low sec can only be improved my encouraging more players and more types of players to interact together in low sec systems i think we should encourage a mix of three different types of players law abiding players law enforcement players and of course law breaking players if we get a mix of these players then low sec would be a more fun and dynamic place for pilots uselaw abiding playersthese are players who are not interested in pvp and so at the moment are very unlikely to use low sec in order to encourage more of them to visit there can be a number of changes the first could be to remove the jump highways and force people to travel through low sec when moving around the empire as discussed elsewhere on this forum although the discussion is still going on the basic concept is that to move from jita to rens as an example you would need to fly through some low sec systems which would encourage you to bring escortsscouts or fly in convoys which brings more players into the systems to go along with this there should be more of a need to travel through such as more npc buysell orders are contained in only one part of the empire to encourage traders to go get them or these orders actually being in low sec systems themselves another option which many people have put forward is to have some sort of industry that is contained within low sec however this will require a lot of time from the devs so its not likely at this point in timelaw enforcement playersas it sounds this is players who have a high security status and like that but also want to pvp as i write this most players dont see bounty hunting other players as a real or even side profession within the game in order to change that i think player pirates should have a bounty on them on top of player created bounties this should be based on the size of ship they are flying and how bad their security status is and to make life more interesting the bounty should double if you can kill them when they have gcc to give these players more targets i think anyone with gcc should be a valid target for them regardless of security status also while in low sec people who show up yellow because of a poor sec status should also be legitimate targets in some forums there is talk of brining concord into low sec in a limited fashion i think that would be wrong and players themselves should be encouraged to step in to act as the deterrentlaw breaking players even without making changes a lot of people will be pirates they will attack easy targets like minerstransports and any wannabe police they think they can take however i think it could be worth giving them something to do when there are no targets going through for example pirate mission agents could be added where a low security standing is needed along with the faction standing to increase the level of agents these mission would be combat based within low sec where the pirates could then also be checking local for real targets as they do the missionsto make this fair however i would make it that you need a bad sec status to get much out of these so the players must make a choice to cut themselves off from high sec for a time to do thisgoing by the minutes from the csm meeting it seems to be up to us to provide the ideas for change what i have written is only after a day of thinking about it so most of the ideas will have a problems and probable wont work but i believe i am right when i say we need different types of players in low sec to make it fun and so we need different incentives to encourage players to come in i know most people wont agree with everything
second life in stations  incarna ring a bell anyone
i disagree because very little more would be required for it to be more than just marketing ccp committing some dev resources to csm requests as implied by stakeholder status this must be reflected in ccps resource planning even just 5 of the total dev resources would do wonders im guestimating that would mean about half the resources of one scrum team seeing that many csm requests are low hanging fruits a lot could be done with that already
wow ccp alt muchyour excuses for ccp are absolutely pathetic
hmmmhow appropriate you fight like a cow 
very concise and well written post tks for the advice mate
at a first glance the minutes seemed very wellwrittenbut then hangerffs illiterates go back to friggin elementary school
where are those small fixes i have been wondering in the 2 years im playing eve ccp hasnt been able to fix something simple as the price history graph that has been broken since dominion for instance i doubt if they even located where the problem is tbh
you forget to mention that bugs often return in ccp land or that they are claimed to be fixed while in fact they are not drones having a will of their own comes to mind for example
i do not disagree to that as said there will allways be bugs and there are allways some bugs fixed in each patch read the patch notes its all documented there wether or not you would like ccp to fix more bugs is a completly different matter but saying ccp does not fix bugs or that they said they would not fix any bugs in the next 18 month is just untrue
we all know that there is no such thing as bug free software thing is ccp seems to be introducing more bugs than it fixes at least in my experience and letting simple bugs linger for years is not good game making you can spin and twist that all you want but it simply isnt look if ccp introduced a bug in expansion x i expect them to fix it in patch x1 x2 or even x3 or 4 i do not however expect that bug to linger and even survive the next expansion launch furthermore there are aspects that should have een overhauled long long looooong ago take sound for instance take the ui and im sure others can name a few others of the top of their head i truly believe that the path ccp is walking right now and has been walking the past few years will be the death of the game the lack of competition has saved there butts for now but i doubt that will last forever myself i would not even be playing eve anymore if i couldnt sustain my accounts with plex without too much trbl as i simply dont think this game is worth cashing out 2030 bucks a month for
hard to say that but is true csm is uselesswhy  because nothing happen when they give to ccp an idea what the players needjust check this date and promises submission date 02122008 votesyes
that would be me although im sometimes wondering whether it isnt the other way around
its not true csmnot this one got the mete 0 item drop taken from bs was i think bunyip and or ank
fyp
the op doesnt seem to be ank they just have compatible personality disorders
excellent player run economy ok obviously you must have been recycling pos mods just before pi startedepic  fleets wtf game are you playing i had more fun in 2005 with issn than recently on a shc angel slideshow night five years later
wotoh
that is how i would title the csm minutes i just read what i read is ccp is going to work on incarna and dust 514 for the next two years instead of eve lets face it both are different games than eve incarna is some sort of sci fi second life and dust 514 cant even be played on a pc pi  i havent tried it as it just seems tedious maybe its important for dust 514 but i really dont care im not against either of these games dust or incarna and i hope ccp does well with them but the only reason is because i hope they make more money to spend on eve however i do have some expectation that some of the money i spend on this mmo will go into the game i actually play and love tyranis was the worst expansion the only thing that even remotely captured my attention made me wince a cheap t1 battleship used to be a good way to fight even though you were against larger numbers the insurance would allow you to get back the cost of the hull plus some of the expensive large mods now that is gone so there is no cost effective way to fight when you are outnumbered that sums up tyranis for mearnar matt and guilhem responded that low sec is a bit broken is not what it should be and ccp are aware of this a specific low sec expansion is not on the 18 month plan however ccp is looking into a combat expansion where combat awareness and information regarding combat would be refined for the user not the combat mechanics themselves which would benefit every eve player rather on focusing just on low sec at the moment ccp are focusing on planetary interaction and incarna but maybe next summer there could be a combat expansion rather than a feature specific expansion even though ccp would like to change low sec it will not happen in the next eighteen months what does this mean combat awareness and information would be refined will the overview indicate who is neuting us will it make it clear who is scramming you as opposed to just disrupting youccp you have to understand that this is not what people who play eve want to hear remember we are the ones who actually like eve enough to pay for it every month to play as far as im concerned you might as well tell us you will not spend any time in the next two years on eve because all your focus is on this really cool new twilight game your making complete with hunky werewolves suave vampires until you guys are actually going to work on eve why have a csm is it to grief us when you want to start working on eve again reconvene the csm and let us know what your thoughts are
im not happy with ccp right now but there is really no need for a twelfth thread on this issue
1 yes we have many many threads on this already 2 and evidently were now not allowed to use the sig that criticizes ccp for abandoning eves problems not that i am discussing moderation at all only mentioning it
i read the minutes with interest i believe most people least of all the csm are not surprised by ccps responses but i applaud this csm for posing the right questions nonetheless good work
i doubt it have you read some of the garbage they publish as serious articles id say theyre desperate for anything legibleon another note i agree with the endorsement of the thread and hereby second third and fourth it
seems like mynxee was taking the lead on that topic at the summit id be interested in her thoughts about how to collect and organize the ideas
i recently read an article on microsofts 1 vs 100 being canceled and while the article was all about the gameshow being canceled one part stood out to melinkage  ms cancels 1 v 100as i look around at other large multiuser sites all downloading and uploading and changing data by the millions like facebook myspace even the various playerrun forums  i am curious what our current limitations are with eve and what the difference is from these large scale operations and eves is it the amount of servers running simultaneously their speed is it the underlying code of eve is the budget of ccp smaller than i thought 600k accounts brings in quite a bit of dough i would think and server rentals arent that expensive is it the location would thinks be faster if they spread out the cluster over the world ie renting servers here in los angeles in europe in asiai may be alone here but i look around me and see things on equally massive scales and i wonder why we cant duplicate this in eve why it takes forever to check email while in game as opposed to evegate why they cant split up servers dynamically based on the player load if the player load goes above a certain amount no others are allowed into the system until it is switched to a different server that can handle the loadtheoretically eve should be able to support any number of people all in the same system at once the trick is to seamlessly shift the physical servers their session is hosted on i think most people wouldnt mind a queue as long as the fleet stayed together this would help fleets plan better so they dont overload the systemalso adaptive switching if a fleet of 1000 are warped to the same gate all at once the server could attempt to foresee where they are headed and allocate a dedicated server for the upcoming battle before they even get to the gatei know im showing my ignorance here  but it doesnt seem that far fetched to think ccp should have 1000 blade servers all running at the same time in different parts of the globe instead of a refrigerated closet in newcastle
it all comes down to the amount of interaction between players that the server has to keep track offirstly look at facebook every time you or other people refresh the page it causes the system to query the database and return the most recent status updates if you are in the middle of updating your status then people continue to see the old status information until you finish posting it it is also fairly simple for a given value of simple  to split this load by having multiple servers each client facing server can have its own cached copy of the database and updates can be passed through to those as needed essentially the data is flowing in one direction and doesnt depend on anything elsenow look at a different exampleimagine a bank dealing with millions of transactions a day each of those transactions is a simple process move x cash from account y to account z to ensure money isnt lost the system will do something like this lock both account y and z debit account y credit account z unlock both accountswhen the accounts are locked no other process can read the balance so as to not return incorrect values and if anything tries it will be queued until the lock is releasedhowever the system can still handle transactions on accounts other that y and z and as each transaction is fairly simple any queued requests are dealt with quicklythe bank might have millions of customers but for each transaction there is only interaction between two accountsnow look at eve each ship on grid is interacting with every other ship on grid even if it is cloaked 100km away from the action the server still has to check for collisions and also send updates for all the visible shipsdrones etcif there are 100 players on grid including me and i move my ship then my client sends a move ship message to the server the server calculates my ship position and checks for any collisions etc the server sends my updated position to each of those 100 playersfor practical reasons there is a global tick which limits the updates sent to each player by batching up the player requestsso the last example my gang are shooting a primary target each client sends a shoot gun message to the server for each gun fired the server calculates hit or miss based on the various parameters tracking etc for a hit the victims ship stats are locked the amount of damage done is subtracted from shieldhullarmour and then the stats are unlocked this isnt likely to be the way it is really done but conceptually only one process should be able to change the ship stats at the same time once processing for that tick is complete then the server sends updates to all the clientsthis is more akin to the way bank transactions work than the facebook example but rather than each interaction being limited to two bank accounts each interaction on grid could be a thousand clients or moreit is a far more complicated problem than allowing 100000 people to vote in a gameshow
i dont believe they actually send information every clock cycle the game simulation is deterministic therefore they only need to send information back to the server when there is a user input each user input is sent to all the clients which update based on that input so all the client simulations are synced the clients run the simulation therefore they calculate the collisions damage etc teadaze if it worked the way you are saying then the only thing that the client does is handle graphics sorry but youre wrong
there is most definitely a global tick you can observe the phenomenon in many situations im simply saying that the current public game state will be likely sent to all the clients on grid at that time even if it is only based on player input in most fights people will be making user inputs all the timethe client may well run its own simulation for display purposes but the server has a master copy and that was the reason for desync back in the day the server also deals with damage etc because the first rule of client server is never trust the client i cant prove anything without the code of course
i really love the csm  that was a great reply thanksi guess it would be very similar to a site like etrade  making millions of transactions per second yet needing the security and still be in real timei read in the csm minutes that they are developing a more modular and dynamic way to allocate nodes i would think this architecture change would be at the top of the list why not did ccp give a reason i think people would be less vocal if the game ran smoothly in its current state i know it would give me more security knowing that incarna wouldnt just layer on top of faulty architectureand  would more servers grouped in various parts of the world help the more i think about it a market trading site would be an excellent case study comparing the two
i think im agreeing when i say that in other networked games such as the unreal tournament series which is well documented and allows you to poke around in the script both the server and client simulate the physics of moveable objects but the server data is authoritative in most cases the client assumes that in the absence of user input objects such as players keep moving in the same direction with constant velocity and intermittently the position and velocity are updated causing visible jumps on screen and similar desync behaviour for decorative elements in a level sometimes the simulation is carried out purely clientside as the decoration does not interact with the movement or combat and it doesnt matter if different clients see different animationsi would imagine the same mechanic applies to eve although because you have the option to set a ship to orbit at a certain distance  and many people just leave ships doing that  and also because of finite aligning speeds there will be less obvious desyncing with movement in combat desync effects have been reduced in eve over time which i would attribute to a combination of more efficient transfer of data to clients for example by prioritising the data better and eliminating bugs where the client simulated something differently to the serverpunkbuster type programs aside yes it is possible to modify a client to alter the simulation or input data if you want to hack the game so your interceptor goes at twice the speed you can do that but what you will likely see is a succession of snap backs as your ship position is adjusted to the server version and phantom damage appearing on your ship as the server values calculated with slower speeds etc get updated to the client what you shouldnt be able to do if the code is doing what it should is be able to get an actual combat advantage by such hacking as you cant override the server model of eventsin a game like unreal tournament there is a certain bandwidth between server and client which can be manually throttled by the client and the server prioritises data according to this bandwidth all relevant game data including high priority data such as position and velocity of players and ditto for projectiles and low priority data such as game scores taunts and chat cannot be sent in a single tick or packet  far from it  but it is queued and rearranged so that the high priority data is sent sufficiently regularly to provide reasonably seamless action and the low priority data is squeezed into the pipe as and when space is available no reason to suspect eve does things any differently but this kind of netcode can look incredibly simple but be a real brain melt to debug and improve
some very clever people are working on this stuff weve asked for a dev blog about the presentation we were given on scaling etcsome of the time it does run fine it is the cases with hundreds of people trying to fight in huge battles where the issues kick in they are working on this bit not fast enough for the players of coursemoving the servers apart would likely be worse because remote nodes would have less bandwidth and higher latency to the database clusteras i said im just assuming a number of things based on best practice and other games as fatmarrow has done in his excellent post above so dont take my answers as complete fact
you make a great point about less bandwidth and i do understand that eve isnt just a bunch of numbers like a market trading site even simple physics can get crazy complex when done for thousands of players at the same timeim glad were having a discussion about this though i feel more comfortable knowing the challenges and whats being done to overcome them i think people get a little frustrated when they get little nibbles of devblogs that dont actually speak to the actual issue of the lag  ie the server move devblog i think everyone thought that the server move would fix all of the issuesby the way i do quite a bit in highsec but as soon as i started setting things up in lowsec whenever im out there i do see noticeable lag certain times a few of my corpmates have been kicked even and my client kicks me more when im in lowsec i havent lost a ship yet though
ive lagged out systems with gamecrushing jump lag fcing a fleet of 13 corp mates and part of the situation is that predominion we used to be able to have huge battles with hundreds of people shooting at each other lag was bad but the game was playable now weve got y2ano and 6nj8v the game is actually going backwards
i guess in terms of what finnagain is saying about life in eve post dominion maybe its down to the assumptions that the game makes about why players are in a system to elaborate since dominion we have seen more and more new stuff being added to systems  whether they be anomaliesplexes the changed sovereignty structures planetary interaction etc what i have yet to see is a good explanation on how the loading up of all this stuff affects a systems load time performance for each player that enters that systemfor example pilot a jumps into a system that currently contains no other players upon landing in the system the game code makes the determination that the pilot now that heshe is in the system may wish to do any or all the following things1 continue through to the next gate doing nothing in system2 flies around in system dropping probes looking for stuff3 flies to a pos to do pos stuff4 flies to a moon to drop a pos5 flies to a ss to do some pi stuff6 rat7 mine etc etc etcprior to the expansions after dominion the amount of things that one could do in any one system were generally limited to at most  say half a dozen activities with the necessary db interactions happening in the background post dominion though and the number of possible activities per player in a system starts to rapidly increase and when you consider that not every player will enter a system to do a single thing the game logic will try and provide each player who enters the system with the range of choices on offer now this is fine if one or two pilots enter a system but when multiples of players enter the same system almost simultaneously the game is unable to differentiate between whether these players are going to1 continue through to the next gate doing nothing in system2 flies around in you get the ideanow as the game cant determine the intent of the players once they are in the system it still has provide all of these options and attempts to make the necessary system resources available  db preloads etc  just in case so for example anomalies are flagged for creation rats and flagged for spawning  roids are flagged mining pi is flagged for scanning etc and of course it does this for each playerso it is possible that the underlying logic behind what is available to a player when they enter a system is in fact causing increased lag as the game assumes that no matter whether 1 or 500 pilots enter a system they may wish to mine rat pvp run plexes play with colonies etc  and so consequently tries its hardest to make all of these options available this as each expansion adds yet more things to do in a system the amount of possibilities available to a player expands exponentially to the point where the amount of resources needed to service one player in a system is the equivalent to what was required to service say 20 players in the days of dominionjust a thought
well  it seems to me that lag tends to present itself in 00 most of the time since highsec has the most people i see lots of people flying around and fleets dont appear to be effected much jita even runs smoothly for me but as soon as i get into 00 where people generally move around quickly systems can be empty then all of a sudden full of people and it starts lagging even a gang of 10 can cause a system to lagim curious why they dont have a queue set up based on fleet size if part of a fleet and the fleet will cause the system to become overpopulated why not halt the jump and make the fleet wait until the fleet is moved to a dedicated node whatever a node is this way you dont have 3 that manage to jump through but they cant see anything because their overview hasnt updated and the next thing they see is the inside of a station while the other 300 in the fleet is still stuck on the other side in limbo unable to do anything
that is my feeling seriouslycsm was created as a pr tool mostly  i am not saying it was the only reasonafter i read csm minutes  private blogs of csm members  threads on this forums i think that tool of ccp got out of hand and went rogueafter reading all of that i asked myself a question  do i get the impression that ccp is cooler company or not well certanly not  i specificly say impression  coz ccp is probably a very cool company but csm is not adding to that imagepshint hint such jewels from minutes do not help either blunt lie lag will always be an issue however eve but eve is now from a technical standpoint in a better state than it has ever been
please allow me to refer you to this thread where ive commented on some of the things you are bringing up hope that helps a bit with your changing opinionyou bring up an interesting point which i think shows one of the reasons why other developers i talk to think we are absolutely ridiculously insane for engaging in something like the csm that being the possibility that they will vocally disagree with us in fact with eve thats more likely a probability instead of a possibility eves complexity metagame and very design lend it to so many various playstyles opinions and social groups that representatives of each of those groups will almost necessarily clash to some degree and well if they didnt have serious issues to bring to us would they really be worthwhile ive been amazed with each csm the amount of preparation and thought they bring to the table while they might not have represented pilot x perfectly they do represent the player base pretty well it turns outso yes the csm thrives on diversity and difference of opinion like any good political body should the members didnt go through elections and travel to iceland just to play fanboi and get signatures on their copies of the burning life trust me i had a sharpie ready they as players have issues they think will improve eve online internet spaceships can be very serious business expect dissent indeed kinda cringe every time they arent giving us a high five instinctually 
manifest did you read the feedback in that threadi mean all due respect and i think it is fair to say that after that csm summit people have a new found respect for the actual devs but youre confusing a few points mixing up a bunch of definitions and missing the actual points in questioni really am sorry but this method is not going places other to engage on and confirm a negative spiral there are much better methods at the disposal
i thought the same thing either ccp is using the csm as a pr front or theyre nutshaving suffered through soes many swg snafus i remember their attempt at having class leaders bring forward issues to the dev team while the dev team was filling the class leaders with sunshine and rainbows to feed the players management was pulling assets off of swg to take things in another directionwhen the class leaders started making noises that management didnt like they started dissapearingsoe management was so focused on how to change their game to get new player numbers like the game that shall not be mentioned that they failed to realize one simple thing people that wanted to play tgtsnbm already were people that wanted to play swg as it was already were in the end they failed to get the new players lost nearly all their current players and ruined the company name in the processhistory doesnt repeat itself but it does rhyme i do hope im wrong but im starting to see that pattern come around againonly time will tell
read the minutes about the combat upgraderead about the unannounced feature that csm apparently didnt likewhat can be seen
oh please say that there isnt going to be a ccp equivalent to the combat rebalance  the ngedo we all get to be jedis this time around

i dont recall the part of the insurance contract that refers to fun can you quote it for me i read the insurance contract the last time i insured a ship i understood it were proposing a change to the game so the contract doesnt apply were going to change the contract so that it doesnt pay out for piracy were not outlawing piracybecause i dont want to lose my ship i dont fear lowsec pirates because they stay in lowsec and i dont go there once they come into hisec they become hisec piratesi am sorry it bothers you that i dont want to play the game your way but you cannot insult me into changing my mind again this is not about ganking or risk or currency farming this is about insurance payoutsthank you for restating my point no i have no problem with suicide ganking as an action just as a profession profits from suicide ganking should proceed from salvage and cargo not insurance fraud we are closer to agreeing than ever and as a reference an excuse is something you have after you act a reason is something you have before the vote has not been made so we are all expressing our reasons again insulting me will not change my mind and for the record i did handle the rats  i ran away i lived to mine another day w00tcarebears are mission runners even i know that im just a miner im not a roleplayer so im not playing an angelangle if i wanted to play wow i would so thats not what this is about i dont recall using semantics in my earlier posts but i dont put it past me if i did well spotted i do however fail fail to see how playing eve invalidates my argument explainid think many people would have given up on this by now but i wont go ahead gank all you like my objection is to insurance payouts on pirate vehicles destroyed by concord my personal safety doesnt enter into it the difference between a true ganker and a welfare pirate is the ganker will kill you even if he doesnt stand to make an isk from it he does it for lulz love or hatehe wants you dead not an easy paycheck and of course youre right  suicide gankers are the least of my problems i worry more about mineral prices in jita because you know im a miner
try to keep up the contract is part of the game so it does apply and if u wanna take away the payout then that means i can take out exhumer mining in high sec and im not outlawing high sec mining eitherthat means u do fear low sec pirates u just said theyre the reason ure too scared to even go there likewise after all because of the way we play u felt affected enough to cry for this change and thats why it ties in with ganking risk and currency farming ure the one who wants to deter our way of playing because ure incapable of even defending yourselfin a game 1 insurance fraud is only punishable in real life which means its allowed in eve just giving it a reallife reference does not make it bad ppl kill each other all the time in eve but that does not make it murder 2 a reason can also come afterwards and theres a reason why after all these years payouts still exist in eve which means its still there for a reasonits a gamerunning away is not handlingits running away and if macro miners can create a program to automatically handle rats while theyre mining to show how easy and otherwise riskless your own profession really is yet u cant even perform that simple task while ure actively playing then like i said suicide gankers r the least of your problems 1 a carebear is anyone who wants to avoid conflict entirely that is u which makes u a miner and a carebear2 u dont want to play wow yet u want to turn eve into wowthats some good logic there 3 insurance fraudtheres your semantics which i explained above4 eve does not cater to ignorance and stupidity something u have more than enough of to even be incapable of performing a task so simple that another player can create a simple program to automate 1 thats good to know cause that means a ull be wasting even more of your time here while everyone including me laughs at u and b your current issue with suicide gankers isnt really an issue in the first place if even an utterly incompetent carebear like u will still mine2 once again your personal safety does enter into it or else u would not be crying about it in the first place3 true suicide gankers dont profit from blowing up exhumers at least not the exhumers that were fitted with expensive mods due to the miners stupidity the ones u support r the ones that r killing uunless u were blown up in a factionfitted shipoh wait4 dont forget the high sec rats either lest your own incompetence costs u another factionfitted ship but plz continue
i am sorry i wont change my opinion just be cause you dont agree with me and i wont agree with you if you only insult me i hope you continue to enjoy the game in your own way no matter how the vote turns out as you can be sure i will if this thread and the others like it are any indication the insurance will stop covering acts of piracy and youll need to find a new source of income which i can understand your being pretty upset about if you put as much energy into creating emergent gameplay as you have into deftly refuting my arguments im sure youll be wealthy in no time have fun and good luck out there

should i take it from the fact that you didnt support this that you dont support thisim tired of having a ui thats such a pain in the ass i can barely be arsed to play with it and then having ccp tell me that its not important for the next 2 years because theyve got other cool  they want to do first ive died because of this awesome ui before and then had ccp tell me we dont have any logs of this so go  yourself have a nice dayedit and just fyi since you dont live in 00 ill fill you in the sov changes were bull halfass implemented and  get this this is a shocker  they never went back and tidied them up gosh could it be because they were too busy having two thirds of their manpower work on walking in  o

better late than never
agreed and supported
supported this is beyond late
i support thisfix the by design implementation failures
supported and endorsed fully i would like to see a moratorium on expansions until the game we know and love is in better shapedont get me wrong i actually liked the expansions but quality issues surrounding them are just too much too ignore faction warfare is a great example of an expansion that had possibilities and was fun in the beginning until you realized what some of the problems were but time and time again like the other features it just seems like its done halfa55ed then its on to the the next expansion i want incarna oh yesi do and dust would be nice too but if you release dust with the same lack of quality the recent expansions have had then you will find your first venture into the console fps gaming market will be your last xbox and ps3 players will leave your game in droves and bad press will kill itstop the madnessas for the csm dont relent the quality issue is huge and players are going to get fed up the uneven sub stats of late are a sign of more bad things to come if ccp doesnt change its present course

ccp dont care about eve
i supported back on page 60something of the threadnought all the broken borked wonky stuff affects wspace too though lag is not much of an issue since theres practically no people out hereit doesnt really surprise me tbh weve all seen the release and forget approach too many times now too bad really nulsec used to be a source of great entertainment even though i dont play there like a soap opera im not ashamed of following
agreed csm members keep up the good work
thanks for trying csm shame ccp doesnt care and is too focused on new content

for the love of all that is sacred stop all work on waling in station and fix bugs in gamewhy even have csm if you ignore them

while i agree with alot of stuff sayd in this proposal assembly hall is not exactly the place for ccp its time to fix evethat does very little good
support 100 but also know 100 that it is fairly useless given the minutes of the last meeting
bump bump
sounds feasible  supported
looking forward to seeing this implemented in 3 years
fix it or kill it
supporteddoubt ccp will ever do anything though
ccp needs to be continuing development on the games functions they already have not dumping half baked ideas into eve and then leaving to do some other half baked featuresworking on making fw should be a continual process so this thread gets my support
i dont give two tugs of a dead dogs  about fw either but i care more about spaceships than i do about avatars in stations so id support anything that shifts emphasis away from stupid shinies and back onto ingame issues and halffinished content especially things that have been raised again and again and again and have been ignored in favour of the vapourware that is wisshifting fw to 18 months from now smacks of yeah we dont know how to fix this either its too difficult hey look  the sims in space woo playerbase distracted objective acheived
why do we actually need second life in space
thats not bad
wow i see the keep learning skill posters are still coming up with some real winners theres no meaningful depth or strategy in respect to learning skills how many times do the rest of us have to call shenanigans on this ridiculous claim why do older players need to have an attribute advantage they already have in some cases several years of skill training over a new character no new player will ever catch an older player in terms of skill points without that older player canceling their account for a prolonged period of time  even if ccp get rid of learning skills and just add the difference to everyones stats older players will still have higher stats because no real new player is going to train cybernetics to v and dish out half a billion on 5 attribute implants so yeah theyll still have an edge just not as big nor risk freeyeah thanks for this post it sums up a lot of the keep learning skill posters very nicely basically a bunch of lamers very much akin to the darkfall players i remember that rushed to squeeze every possible gain out of exploits then rejoice when the developers eventually fix it and close off the advantage to everyone else how pathetic are some of you that you feel the need to have a big training time advantage over new players that already are at a huge disadvantage simple by virtue of being newccp remove learning skills dont cater to a bunch of lamers
learning skills hurt the resupply of new players remove ffs
definetely supportedlearning skills are a plague
signed
trebor still around when can we expect this proposal to be raised
learning skills are fineif new players find them confusing well what in this game isnt confusing for new playersnot supported
its not about confusion as a new player you have to wait few months to train your learning skills before you can actually start playing the game this leads to loss of motivation  quit
no a new player does not have to spend a few months training anything before actually playing the game i didnt i started playing day one
go
sorry but no it isnt i know what the thread is about since i created it the thread is about making lowsec a better and more immersive place if that encourages more people and it should then that is good too but this thread is not about getting carebears to go to lowsec

but wait guise eve is supposed to be about doing things the hard way me makes a bookmark 15km behind a gate and warpsto15
this is actually in game on sisi so i guess this thread is sort of moot now unless they are going to take it out and tease us the align to fleet member would make rolling safes lol broken though
not supported
 and and and make it so you start off your factions militia bleh bright orange
yes because this would encourage risk averse players to leave their mission hubs how
could be fun
not supported  there are already enough nerfs of high sec play go play at the playground which is designed for the bloodbears  null or whbtw low sec needs to gets sufficient attention by ccp without cutting away the playing high sec player by nerfs in the same movewhat i am for 100 is to have the possibilty of getting to the hubs faster via low sec or null sec why not introduce a technique by the pirate factions which is like hyperspace think of it like a form of wh space but without sleeper drones rats could be some form of creatures like in star trek liquid space designed around pirate activities with organic poses etc
full support to this it even has a storyline to make it right with faction warfare eventually in such an environment the borders could quite believably become neutral zones of lowsec
 agreed this has great faction war potentialnot in the op this is about trade not missions and nothing short of agents limiting their missions followed by cool down times would subvert that
i dont see how this is a high sec nerf the typical high sec dweller for example me wont recognize this change at all hell still run his lvl4 missions where he run them before he would still farm his datacores where he did before he would still visit his local hub to buy stuff like he did before
new players often create characters in one empire but need to travel to another to join their friends low sec highways today are filled with smart bomb camps i imagine it would be even worse if they were the only routei think this would make it really hard for new players to hookup with their friends onlinein addition increasing the number of prowlers flying threw low sec isnt what i would consider a win for increasing interest in low secnot supported
the people who honestly believe the devs understand game mechanics far more than experienced players are likely people who do not themselves understand the game mechanics there are literally thousands of players that see the huge flaws in their plans before they do
supporting this because mazz told me to dedit also gratz mazz on getting into csm right after i get purged because i cant play 
tbh ccp should just become a spaceholding alliance watch how many players turn out to shoot their  they can test straight from tq while their space is being sieged to see whats causing the lag 5000 players dropping into ccps space just to  them off should do the trick
because we all know all legendary capital fleets fly without supportat all times
you really dont realize why target painting dreads is dumb do you
why all the desire to add this tower has been offline for x days to this either you can remove a tower by the employment of an anchorable module once its offline or you can attack it and reduce it to 50 structure and then remove it personally in spite of thinking of the adu im just as in favour of the simple 1 change required solution of tower hits 50 structure becomes unstable can be unanchored by hostile forces although id prefer to move away from the model of must wardec inactive 2 man corp w abandoned tower and assemble large battleship fleet for boring hourslong highsec opi really dont see that there should be any prerequisite this tower as been offline for x days your tower goes offline you get wardecced your tower can be removed or assploded all this talk of sufficient warning goes out of the water when you consider that theres notice from a wardec and notice from the tower itself 24 hours is considered sufficient notice for people to start shooting your tower when they cant steal it so it should also suffice for when they canwhy should the force unanchor take 24 hours the owner should already know their tower is in trouble  you declared war and then it started sending out under attack mails if anyone was going to show up they shouldve done so before then it doesnt matter whether your tower goes boom or gets taken away  in both instances its goneas soon as the tower goes offline and all modules have been destroyed so would this make a wardec on a corp to remove its tower a choice between blowing up the tower and taking the modules or blowing up the modules and taking the towerid support that  choose between 500mill in anchored labs or 12bill of tower want both tough choose
i have a map of most the towers in lonetrek i would bet about 13 are offline ill check when i get home
since theres so much debate over whether or not you should be able to steal a poswhy not have them impoundedan active pos burns fuel when its out of fuel it shuts downcharters are not fuel so much as they are an ongoing agreement with the landlords of the systemso charters should continue to be consumed whether the pos is online or not the mere act of anchoring a tower requires you to give up 1 charter then you need to load them into the fuel baylike they are nowif a tower runs out of fuel it goes offline but if a tower runs out of charters whether it is still online or not it is immediately impoundedthe tower and all associated modules are carted off to the station housing a corp officeor another approach would be to get rid of the charters themselves and instead have a rental bill if the bill goes unpaid then the pos is impounded that way pos belonging to bygone corps will eventually go away
the problem of place holder poss in high sec is out of controlthe only solution to this problem is to tie it to the need for speed mechanic that deletes untended items in space which havent been touched for x days attach a value to posslets say if it hasnt been refueled in 90 days fair enough amount of time imo then the tower unanchors and remains at the planet to be scooped to the first party who stops by or if you dont want to go that route just have the pos deleted from space if it has gone unfueled for 90 daysby refueling im referring to the point where the tower goes offline if theres no activity at that tower in 90 days from the minute it goes offline then take it off the moon
yes please
this is something that has been on the top of my mind for the past month i got involved with eve because of all the little cool things i saw that made it appear like the company was different from all the other lets make shinies so the ignorant masses will flock to our money farms for a month the marketing numbers never lie companies out theresadly i am learning that it is quite the opposite respect to all the awesome developers like manifest you guys are what makes the game worth playing and the executives unfortunately leave an awful smell in their wake that is very unbearablei am paying very close attention to how ccp handles everything in the upcoming months and i am prepared to quit if it becomes obvious that ccp isnt going to start taking responsibility and seeing how long it takes to get a character going i will probably never come back if i have to pull the plug im gonna take a radical step here and point out the obviousremember how csm got started in the first placeif eve can survive the t20 debacle it can certainly survive a hey you made your promises now keep them article i love the idea of a protest and i would certainly take part unfortunately its very difficult to come up with one that would be effective i highly doubt management would care about taking down third party sites or even people refusing to log in theyve still got subscriptions and press coverage would only be effective if the reasoning for the blackout were addressed this begs the question why not just go straight to them in the first placeid suggest everyone gathering in a single system with ships named to show protest to crash the server but that would be inviting a ban for making it more difficultexpensive to run eveitd be cool if someone could come up with an effective and non baninducing protest idea though
its nothing personal here but reallythe idea of organizing a press attack to convey a few fans disgruntlement over lingering lag factional warfare issues and an empty spot on the map is just stupid not only that but overly self important this isnt cnn news worthy it isnt even worth a blurb on massively unless they are desperate for an article and on the way out if you love the game in such a way as to kill it or try to slap it around for leaving you then you are in a sick and dysfunctional relationship we know how those turn out for people in real life if you are that ticked off over ccps current direction then do yourself a favor and vote with your wallet thats the only real voice you have with any consumer productenough of the player base seems quiet stable and happy enough mission running along in hi sec that i can see why some of these issues may not be considered a high priority ccp doesnt have any reason to believe that they are ignoring the player base just you really you want change and an issue brought to the forefront then find a way to motivate enough people within the game to come over here and vote or pontificate on itas soon as you have to look for external stimuli like a news agency to poke a hole in something like this for you then youve already failed before starting
notice how close this would take you complete failure cascade ccp
you are aware that the ny times has several times reported on eve goings on remember the pink hat its a bit unconvincing for you to say that this is all stupid and nobody wants to cover it when the mainstreadm press has covered things of less importance than ccp admitting that theyre letting the game rot on the vine for a year and a half to two years
i dont think theyre ignoring the csm or the playerbase for that matter i just think that they believe  perhaps correctly  that sticking to their development cycle and releasing new content every six months is overall better for the game than the alternative suggestions i dont see ccp absent not responding not reading the feedback not flying people out to sit down and discuss  what i see is ccp ultimately disagreeing with your our the vocal forum warriors and csms assessment of what is best for the game  at least on the issue of stop development and bug fix versus finish development cycle then turn to bug fixes
ccp manifest has gigantic stones for daring to step into this vipers nest you are one cool dude and if i make it to fanfest im buying you some beer
if the csm is a stakeholder and being a stakeholder means a seat around the table when the priorities are set how can it be that the csm goes to the summit and the priorities for the next 18 months are already cast in stone
a pop culture bit in the arts section about a pink hat wearing cow poke playing eve in a struggling news paper looking for a gamer feel good piece and a couple of liberal arts dollars is supposed to convince me that the forum ranting of a few disgruntled fan boys who cant motivate enough of the current player base into caring about their issue right here to make a difference is news worthyk i hear people cover kitten births too maybe you could convince a hack to write about it but thats just not enough to do anything worthwhileif you want to see what a motivated player base can do then just look at the wow real id fiasco this just doesnt compare ccp isnt leaving eve to rot on the vine thats your perception they are expanding the game with new features while leaving your issue as well enough done for now but keep trying you may get somewhere if you figure out a worthy strategy
our issues dude you got no clue just because highsec missionbears can play the game just fine it doesnt mean the game runs smooth or that we as the playerbase should ignore broken promises or wait another 2 to 4 years until the broken or uncomplete stuff finally gets the dearly needed fixes and attention and even then only probably as the minutes put it
for example suspend the automatic renewing paying subscription saying that you have doubt on the future development of the game and that you didnt want to be tied to a 6 month commitmentit is exactly what i have done for half of my accounts if things continue as they are doing they will live with plex or more probably they will go dormant if ccp dont take several years old accounts unsuscribing as a bad sign i think nothing will change their course if on the other hand i am the only one or one of the few doing that it mean they are following the right path
im not in favor of csm bad mouthing ccp that is a bad idea for everyone in eve ccp is the greatest game company and has made the best computer game ever i complain as much as anyone but we cant lose sight of that that said after reading the minutes i dont understand what csm is doing other than pr btw im actually fine with it being pr and i hope its good pr for the company  every topic that csm wanted to bring up was met with same response not for 18 months because we are working on incarna and dust well the players really know nothing about incarna or dust therefore how can csm possibly represent the players on these topicsok csm says they want to be able to punch each other in stations well this was never discussed with any players on forums that i saw my own view is that if punching each other in stations would delay ccp from getting back to work on eve for even a single day then leave the punching out bottom line on all this is that incarna and dust are basically different games that players know nothing about therefore the players havent given any input on it therefore if csm makes recommendations they cant be speaking for the players so what is the point of having a csm over the next 18 months  if not for prccp keep some people working on things for eve dont put everything off for 18 months which i easily read as 2 years maybe only allow one type of station to be walked in dont design navy stations yet or any of the types of stations that are in jita that way you dont have to worry about jita lag right now and you dont have to spend time developing all the different stations limit the work on incarna to allow some concurrent development of eve  as we know it
its interesting how quickly your argument went from thats not newsworthy to okay sure the ny times has covered stories about eve just like this but well hey look over there ps hacks oh hell no you cant reason someone out of a position that they didnt use reason to get into in the first place i was just pointing out the facts common misunderstanding paying with isk means that someone still payed with cash this is not an effective protest nor is stopping playing as lots of folks over time have done just that for various reasons and ccp is unfazed if anything lack of old players just reinforces the strange belief that ccp seems to have that they need to crank out halffinished buggy expansions in order to attract new subscribers
common tactic changing what other people say to suit your argument that is not what i saidwhen you explicitly state i want to be capable of stopping paying in any way within a month instead of the current 6 month plan and  i dont feel that the proposed future developments are worth 15 month they should take note that is a valid argument instead and something that i have covered already in another thread sadly i dont feel that currently eve is giving me back my 7170  for the six month subscription at least not on the secondary accounts maybe it is worth the 300milion iskmonth maybe not it all depend if they can make the isk passively as you say voting this way has drawbacks as it can reinforce ccp opinion that they need more new players an argument that dr battlesmith covered reasonably well in gd but doing nothing will reinforce this opinion the same and calling the press is a dangerous move an the press has different goals from the eve players
i didnt change anything suspending renewal does nothing unless you let the accounts go inactive and if you dont let them go inactive then either youre paying with money but on a nonsixmonth basis or youre paying with gtcs which are still paying with money but youre just using a proxy if all you do is remove automatic renewal then all ccp really knows is that some people arent committing as much cash in one go the point is that nothing so far has had any effect or its had a negative effect people not resubbing some or all of their accounts no effect or causing ccp to focus on getting even more new playerswriting well though out coherent arguments on the forums totally ignorednearly 2000 accounts taking the time to support the drive for excellence and against halfbaked crapware expansions ignoredthe csm taking the time to draft a comprehensive proposal and demands not just ignored handwaved away and told that new content is their drive the point is that nothing else so far has worked ive seen a lot of naysaying but not one solution that hasnt been tried and that might work
the problem i have with this is that its usually just a very few loud minority that screams to have certain things changed to their way and when that doesnt happen then this is somehow translated to ccp isnt listening to the playerbase id be curious what percentage of the playerbase is the csm really representing it doesnt take much to realize that these forums are plagued with whines concerns from the same usual suspects these suspects bump their csm to get their changes through even if they dont represent the playerbasethe csm is there to advise and somewhat oversee what ccp is doing transparency and all that theyre not there at least i hope not to strongarm the game into the direction of the few that voted them in that particular termif the csm ever turns into the final say decisionmaking entity then that will be when the game will lose balance and thus start to die out ccp has been successfully managing their game for 7 years now give this power to the very loud minority that wont be happy until their paper beats rock and scissors and  will finally hit the fan
in the csm minutes i noticed attention was paid to unfinishedforgotten content and imho cosmos is pretty much at the top of the list it is broken down busted on the state line roadso here is my proposal first the fixes 1 bring gallente and minmatar cosmos up to speed with caldari and amarr more missions and better rewards are absolutely necessary for these two2 modules leave the fittings the way they are boost the meta level of all items attribute wise 12 points 3 make all blueprints a maximum of 3 runs4 decrease the skillbook drop and increase training time on the ancient tech skills not the invention skills5 balance the rewards in the lowsec amarr and minmatar cosmos constellations they suck now on to moar cosmos1 add 1 new cosmos constellation to each empire in highsec continuing the arc2 add gallente and caldari lowsec cosmos constellations to bring it in line with amarr and minmater 3 add 4 cosmos constellations to rogue drone space with new bpcs and items these should preferably continue on with the whole soctdrone mother theme found in parchannier4 add pirate agent cosmos constellations to all 00 npc regions with the same amount of agents as the highsec constellations with yes new bpcs and items that have nothing to do with gas harvesting por favor give them gate agents that hand out pirate ship bpcs based on standings just like in highsec5 add a fourth gate agent the ones that give out the ship bpcs that hand out a sort of endofarc epic storyline one time only like the rest of cosmos so your choices matter these should require insanely high standings like the bs offers to make the choices during the arc seriously matter and prevent a guide coming out 2 days later6 add 1 more lowsec constellation for each empire 7 wormhole cosmos sites stranded agents in space is win eta increase difficulty accross the board cosmos should be a group effort it adds alot of flavor when you do them in a group and get lots of giggles when everyone gets to read michis psychoyoda babbling to put my money where my mouth is about the skills and training time i sold my all level 5 cosmos building alt a long time ago and do not have them trained on this character my main i also totally volunteer to be ccps slave and work for free to help get any of this donecosmos is fun the one time missions make it a little bit more exciting for people who want a break from pvp than doing normal missions the items really need a boost to bring them in line with the times and the whacky pf in the arcs is good for lulz and speculation basically cosmos has amazing potential and should be a priority as far as content thanks for taking the time to read this
bumpand guys ive answered that question 7 times by now unless you are willing to make any sort of constructive argument which you clearly are not willing to do stop
this is a response to the devblog dated 16072010 titled iterative development and whats happening in 2011 by ccp zulu i would like a vote on wheather ccp has now committed to overstretching itself at the cost of the eve online gaming experience further that there is not enough commitment resources time or interest being focused on that game we all knew and loved of 918 months ago compared to sidline projectsfirst i think this post may upset some people im sorry about that and this post is not about what shouldnt be in eve as this is unqestionably ccps choice as a buisness first and game developer 2nd however i would like to express concern even anger at ccps proposed timescales now i would again admit that ccp is a buisness first and game developer 2nd and thus it has to do what is in its interest in terms of product development timescales but i think there has been an error in judgement my problem is that i think ccp is taking on too much stuff in to short a time frame in order to meet arbitrary time scales for other products i fear this is a problem for three reasons the first is a matter of personal opinion but relates to the other two which relate to a wider refelection on eve as a whole and the quality of the game 1 as a pure eve player i really dont care about character interaction or fps consol games that link to eve i appreciate this may be important to some gamers both current and future but im really not interesed does ccp even know what percentage of the active eve community want these features over as an example game stability i know i wasnt asked were you i am worried that these large scale and difficult undertakings by ccp zulus own admission will side track from eve especially when taking into account the possible ramifications listed below in points 23 2 i really have to question the gaming quality of eve at the moment i am concerned with eves ability to offer a stable gaming platform for its current users the game has even by ccps admission become less stable over the last 914 months now while i admit ccp is trying to resolve this via mass testing a clever solution nothing has been solved yet to a problem that should have never existed i question how much resource is being put in to fixing it and what the proposed timescale is ccp are putting up a smokescreen here apparently to shield a problem with no discernable conclusion this worries me as they can tell us the release datesish for ambulation and the fps consol game whatever they are both called am i the only one sat here worried coz all i want is a stable game to enjoy i worry that with twice yearly upgrades none that solely focus on stability and now not one not two but three if u include the latest planet mining initiative large projects that ccp is now spreading itself far to thin to provide a quality gameing experience for the current and future gaming community 3 linked to point 2 if ccp is further expanding whilst not maintaing a stable and reliable platform for product 1 eve online what hope is there if ccp is extended over new projects and new games to provide support for a game that is already loosing stability especially in null sec proposed recruitment expansion aside if ccp cant do it now will they be able to with multiple large projects i dont think it can further if these new projects draw in the new gamers to eve that ccp hopes it should will this not make the game even more unreliable it is not even working at current capacity now this may be selfish but i enjoy playing eve online coz i enjoy flying internet spaceships in fleets of like minded people against similar opposition now i may be wrong here but am i alone in thinking that rather than all this other stuff that it would be nice if eve as it is now or was 918 months ago just worked  plain and simple
clarification i make this point  am worried that these large scale and difficult undertakings by ccp zulus own admission will side track from eveplease note that i refer to the fact that ccp zulu admits these are large and complicated projects having re read my post i see it could read that ccp zulu has admiited that these projects are a side track this was not my intention i only ment to show that ambulation and fps were large and complicated projects by admission of ccp zulu but i dont have the room to edit this in the main post additionalas of 23072010 i have changed the title of this thread for claritysorry for any confusion
no
i dont think that you read the proposal the idea was that the primae model would be used for new ship types that fulfilled specialized roles that havent already been filled this would essentially be a reskin allowing ccp to make the most use of the ship model
good looking shipbad statsplease ccp next time you guys create a new ship model make it at least worthy to fly the primae in its current state is a piece of crap i cant even sell it at a decent price its that bad
i fully support the idea that the ships model is reused to form another ore ship
this is a pulse which when it hits the drone it incapacitates the drone the controller loses all control of the drone theyll need to fly to the drone and rescoop them to get control back
this sounds remarkably like a smartbombthis is a pulse which when it hits a drone it vaporizes the drone the controller loses all control of the drone theyll need to fly to the market hub and restock them to get control back
instead of a pulse just make it so a neut that drains a drones capacitor has a similar effect a neut can power off a drone
opps forgot to mention that the pulse doesnt do any damage to the dronesthats not bad an idea infact doing this and neutbombs can serve as the idea
noooooo way i do believe that u dont give a  about salvager profession u just want to scan down the unprobable ships like t3 now lol
so the few brave people doing for some reason missions in low sec should now also be able to get probed down quickly by core scanner probes
not really thought out not supported plus ninjas have it easy enough already
ive thought these same things for a long time id make the first wreck in each room spawn a mag site beacon thats the same sig as salvage profession sites agree that deadspace should mask the sigs so its harder to probe down an active mission runner or their current battlefield but you can easily locate a discarded battlefield if no one salvaged it first id also change the mechanics so wrecks are considered neutral but the loot spawns in a corp affiliated jet can that way anyone can tractor the wrecks but only the proper owners can tractor the lootas for the arguments of whether or not wrecks belong to the runner a quote regarding the new abandon wrecks function i highlight for emphasis
what would make sense is to be able scan down abbandoned cans and wrecks as for the so called ninja salvaging if you start a career in this business you should do you homework properly and learn all the skills if you have done so you will be able to find stuff pretty easily this form of carebearsalvaging is laughable
its the same in real life several cars use the exact same chassis its realism for space chips new ships arent a massive priority that saidrogue drone dominixrole bonus 50 drone mwd speed 25km drone rangegallente battleship 10 drone damagehitpoints per level 5 velocity per level 20 damage to japanese schoolgirls per levelthat would be nice 3
because we really need more half finished contentyeah
yep we live in high tech space and you dont have radio communication with agenthello john its that new cellphone actual yes it is ok so ill take it im omw no if somebody comes sooner ill sell it contact me personallycurrent system is stupid as that words in 
this already is possible the epic missions are all remotablethey dont do that for lvl4s for obvious reasons
this has been proposed multiple times  ccp were planning on adding it at the same time wormholes appeared the problem is ccp wanted to add virtual arenas where nothing would actually be lost the backend doesnt support such objects its also why we cant have decoys so having coded it all up they couldnt impliment itnow i dont know if ccp will be willing to revisit this concept and dispose of the nothing is lost part of their idea because frankly if i step in to the ring im going to fight tooth and nail to keep my ship going and win my bets  so supported kinda
thunder dome 2 man enta1 man leaves
right click pilots name  call on a duelthe pilot gets duel reqest if accepted bets can be made by other playerscan bd watched and locked if somebody interfiers for example remoreps the rile breaker gets nucked by a concord titancant see why not duel record honorable pvp in my eve
as has been made clear ccp arent going to touch eve for 15 year in which time theyre going to deploy incarna and dust despite loads of devs being available for a useless thing as spacebook there arent enough to make any large changes to eve as only useless features get priorityccp have made it clear you the csm are a waste of time and pointless as none of your proposals will be taken into account anyway thus the only way to make it clear to ccp and the world this is unacceptable i recommend the csm en mass boycott meetings with ccp then when they bring journalists in to promote the csm as something relevant they can film empty meeting rooms
if its really that big a deal to you how about you boycott eve eve account management  cancel account your voice will resonate
all csms who will vote against my ideas should boycott the meetings
wont happen
csm we need a polish teamccp xboxcsm bugs need fixingccp xboxcsm excellenceccp xboxcsm players will start leavingccp xboxcsm xbox  released fix gameccp moar xboxplayers fu ccp ccp
yes because refusing to sit down and talk things out and instead whining and crying like children will work better
you forgot to check the support box
being frustrated is perfectly reasonable smashing your toys because ccp wont do what you want is not terrible idea not supported
you think asking them again will yield something other than resources are committed come back after incarnanot saying cancel the meetings but what could they possibly achieve now
well thats certainly an option super whopper yes erm but heres my proposal lets get toughthe time for talking is over call it extreme if you like but i propose we hit them hard and hit them fast with a major  and i mean major  leaflet campaign and while theyre reeling from that wed follow up with a whist drive a car boot sale some street theatre and possibly even some benefit concerts ok now if thats not enough im sorry its time for the tshirts ccp out  chameleonic life forms no thanks  and if thats not enough well i dont know what will bec
csm should do a sit in they should handcuff themselves to the beer cooler and not leave until ccp fixes  or the beer runs out either way they will make a statement
you guys need to stop whining about ankh
heres how this will gocsm to ccp hey um were not coming this monthccp to csm ok now we can cut all the bull out and just keep it to ourselves that we arent going to work on anything new ccp doesnt care about the csm it exists only as a figurehead now
can i haz your stuffz
without dust how else they are going to double their member subscriptions like they said in there eve presentationexellanceexellance 1200in august we shifted themes again and now we have shifted over to exellance so more production its about doing more features and doing more output now u will see ccp and eve work more on refining and doing fewer things but do them realy well so u can expect alot of the existing things in eve to be improvedabout dust its all about the subcribers 2813 keep believe i would say why would people take a new subscription for dust if there are plenty of there fts games that are much betters such as bc2  cod double subcription is a little bit to fairytale like without improving lagg issues as it is nowi surly hope that the more output means less lagg ow wait lies oh noeslets go back to the origin of all these negative feeling the players get recently why is that the customersclients are getting tierd of lag while there isnt enoguh communication between ccp and the clients about fixing certain issues coincidental its affecting alot of players while u mr ccp are intoducing pi ect something thats being seen as useless in the eyes of the common 00 player especialy after the woops i forgot to remove the npc seed orders fkup ruing the pi market for many months to come my advise for u mr ccp is to get fimiliar with crm and expecialy customer intimacy
this is an issue thats been around for ages and is a really easy fixthe main problem with rockets is that their explosion velocity is too lowfully skilled t1faction rockets have an explosion velocity of 1275 this is way too low to be effective against other frigate targets especially with the prevalence of afterburner frigates since the scram changes your average ab frigate when webbed is still going 300500 ms even a scramwebbed mwd frigate will not take full damage an armor tanked rifter for example will be going 177msplease fix the explosion velocity to make rocket based ships viable for pvp malediction hawk kestrel inquisitor breacher and flycatcher could actually be effective pvp ships not to mention the plethora of other frigate hulls that often use rockets as a secondary weapon systemthe actual fix is quite simple just increase explosion velocity a 100150 increase would be just about right

dear csmccpim here to propose a small but major change that id like to point outthose of you who have those long employment historys dread how long it takes to load sometimes and this also goes for us pvpers out there who are running around looking for a juicy target to kill example of this would be your running around and you find someone in local so you check his employment history when this happens if there history is noticeably long enough it will tend to lag you for 23 secs because there is soo much being loaded its the same with standings ive found as wellim asking csmccp to look into maybe fixing this issueideainstead of having someones employment history so long you have to keep scrolling for ages on end just simplify itexamplenow what id like to do is say he had m0o corp in his employment history more then once likeinstead of showing it like this  why not do it like thisand with dates just leave the very last date from the last time they were in the corporationproscuts down on load timesmakes employment history look a bit more organized and neatnicerid have to say maybe even helps the server a bit because theres lots of pvpers out there pirate corps that are constantly checking peoples employment history and bio etc to see who they areeconomicid honestly believe that this might also be a reason why some characters dont sell on the forums because of its long history so having this change would help some character prices go up i know kinda dumb but hey some people are really picky about there employment historyconsdunno really if you can think of some go ahead and post emthanks for your time and sorry for the so long of a huge post
consit messes with the timeline say i wanted to see what the first corp was he joined with your example i would be inclined to think eve university were it while in truth m0o was itwhat they could do instead is only show like the last 10 employments and then have you press a button to load the nextprevious ten entries kinda like with the wallet transactions dialog
so you want the goodies but dont want to pay themyes faction navy but first nerf them noif this is implemented you get exactly the same deal of fw participant enter high sec and the faction navy attack you as you have declared war against all the empires and you will get exactly the same level of assistance of fw players special store and special missions in hostile territory no doubt that some will join the question still stay how manyi feel that fixing the current iteration of fw is more urgent that adding another feature to it a feature that will probably stay half finished for years
um what exactly are the goodies that pirate faction players would be getting in your mind i dont know about others but special stores and fw pve missions is not what i want out of being involved in a faction war at all other than that what are you offering me for all the penalties you want to impose
certainly theres gonna be some issues to work out but generally i like the ideasupported
i am not sure how difficult it is to create a content creation suite of tools that allow us to develop new and exciting content for eve this content can be tested on sisi and voted on by players  reviewed by ccp the best can be implemented into the game with a patch by ccp ccp can reserve the right to change the content as they see fit ie tweak it or add things etc change copy ship models textures etcthings that can be playercreatedships hull variants geometry textures etcstationsstar gatesposmissionsmodulesclothing  accessories post incarnanpc ships shuttles busses luxury liners personal spaceships etcportions of the code can be opened up allowing devs to work on certain aspects of the game some will break it some will improve it and ultimately ccp still has full control theyre just helped by the cloud democracy in action right
im going to design a rookie ship that can fit a doomsday device that requires no fuel and minimal skills which i also designed this will be an aoe doomsday like the ones before the titan changes it will get bonuses to damage for this device it will have a onesecond cooldown to ensure that i can fire it in highsec outside jita 44 and kill everyone then fire again and pod them before i get killed by sentry guns implement this ship for it is awesome
you know how stupid the average person is half of em are dumber than that
thats not entirely what i meant and while there will definitely be terrible submissions they can be opened up to the player community via a ratings system on sisi or  a smaller user content test area that is separate from the full sisi test server that basically allows limited testing of missions flying ships clothing etcccp can review these ideas and since most of the work has already been fleshed out pick some to implement into the gamefor instance how many artists and devs worked on the primae the hull that is now imagine if there was a player in iowa usa who was a good 3d modeler and texturer who created a great new ship design and the players voted it up to the top of the list the work has already been done all ccp needs to do is drop it into the game if they want to release a version with unique stats then they run through the playtesters for that to make sure its balanced with the rest of the game
go to spore search for i believe thats your answeredit since basic anatomy is taboo here youll find many examples of player generated genitals there
i agree and have mainly player created exploration sites or missions in mind
id wager that the time they would have to spend vetting player submissions and making the lawyers happy about the process would far outstrip the amount of effort involved in just doing it themselves game design isnt just a matter of doing the coolest everything right now theres a ton more subtlety and longterm planning than that
considering a lot of alliances are still waiting for ccp to vet and deliver their logos in to the game you really think theyre up to looking through thousands of player made missions items encounters ships and weapons i suppose sure but youll be waiting a decade for the reply that your doomsdaying velator didnt make the grade if ccp had shown they could cope with their current delivery of player made content id be all for this but until such time no
yes yes yes it is shty but this new system is worse then the old onepart onetakes a week to conquer a system how many rf timers 3defenders have to win once so blob the system 3hours in advance call friends call fiends call friends sbus wtf nuf said concord why should 00 alliances have to pay concord for space all the alliances does is drop space in the center keep a border of systems and rent everything else or put renters on the borders but everyone knows who has the space fail ccp the sov structures have 30m sppart twothe attacker due to having 3 rf timers to deal with can only relay attack one system at a time this relay give the defender a huge advantage defend once move to the next system and keep up the chain due to them being on there home turf they can reship then jb to the next system the last so called great war showed this when the sc attacked sbued a dozen system but failed to take any now the nc did put up a great deference and idc bout sht that happened up there just shows how the game is now much harder to take space then it comes to the two real ways to honestly conquer space now days the first is the alliance leaders emo rage and quit and disband the alliance the second is the alliance leaves without a fight the north showed if you fight all you have to do is win one fight and u stop the assaultpart 3 more alliances in spacethe goal of the new system was to give small alliance the chance to take space in my honest opinion it made it harder for them they have to fight the sov holder when the sov holder only has to show up once in there peek time to save the systemall the new sov system has done is make it harder for anyone to enter the 00 landscape now yes you just become a pet and pray that you obtain space form the holder but you are still a pet now im not saying that the old system was better but this new system is far far worse the the original other player feedback wanted bout my thoughts1 insurance system i would have just dropped the payout and left it alone with the old system drop the payment by 10m on bs and then people lose money from dieing but not as much as it is now a titan the biggest ship in eve only get 15bill when they cost 5570bill to buy and fit 2invention why not just bring back t2 bpos given idk much bout invention just make them a reward like others but you need a decent chunk of change to buy one from a agent3 add more moons to eve the goal of the new moon goo system was to as i understood it reduce t2 prices by having the large amounts of rarer moons you need less of that type of goo but what ccp didnt do is add more moons to the game then reduced the amount of goo that is produced so the price sky rocked on some stuff hulks 100m to 200m command ships and interceptors etc4i would like to see more space added into the game more high sec regions low sec regions and 00 regions the discovery of a super gate or something like that more eve good eve5 ccp needs to fix the lagg in 00 or stop advertising the fleet fights in there chimerical yes this takes time i know but its been 6months i dont care bout new ships when the first time i fly it ill die due to lagg then get a response our servers show no irregularity i was black screened woke up in a station 3 hours later the only suggestion that i am making is the top 3 the rest are all feedback i want to know how the player feels about these topics
yes please bring back the endless pos spamming and the ensuing grinding that caused sure its much more time consuming than 3 rf timers but its more fun rightand yes lets bring back the pos system so that alliances can spread poses around all they want to secure systems that they actually never use sure thatll detract from the ability of smaller alliances with some cajones to claim a backwater system that no ones uses but who would bother trying to do thatsarcasm
so bob aka band of developers lost delve they knew itd be next to impossible to take it back the change sov mechanics to get delve back now you wanna go back to the oldsystem dohoho
ccps ship balancing is typically an allornothing affair the changes are massive happen once in a blue moon and totally upend the existing order of the universe sometimes they have the complete opposite of the intended effect or have no decent effect at all and as soon as they are made they are left there regardless of how big of a success or failure it issome examplesmotherships were never intended to defang poses in a few minutes but they do that really well nowadaystitans were intended to reduce blob sizes with their aoe doomsday created the biggest blobs ever seen in eve and were ed about for over a year before anything happeneda hundred million freaking hp on sov structures wtfhow long have rockets been messed up and does a fix involve any more than editing a few numbers in their attributes tableso my proposal is to turn ship balancing over to the players assuming there is anyone actually working on ship balancing right now wed like to have devs throw up preliminary ship stats on the test server more often and rely on player testing and feedback more while theres definitely a place for math and calculations of ship stats to plan changes with nothing predicts how players will use a ship better than giving players the ship to usethis is of course assuming that any potential risks for ccp will be mitigated this assumes that players are capable of discovering identifying and reporting gamebreakingly overpowered ships before they go live as well as participating in the first place this also assumes that there will be manpower available to receive feedback from players so for example the planetary interaction npc sell orders screwups dont happen again even though it was predicted by the players to happen
as much as i might like this idea i cant really support it game balance is on the whole better than ive ever seen it some things could use with tweaking but i dont think we actually need anything nearly as large as the projectile buff a while back players are as a rule pretty poor at game design and game balance its very difficult to keep track of all of the things that something can do  and your example of a mothership defanging a pos is a great example of that most players simply dont have the background to know that these things are even possible players tend to have favorites or simply be ignorant of large parts of the game they dont have perfect sp and they dont play all the races what youre suggesting is effectively asking warriors whether wizards should be nerfed i think the best case scenario is to use player experts to do the grunt work for ccp my favorite example of this other than myself of course buff nails on collar is to point at akita t as an untapped resource for market changes yeah hes a bit arrogant on occasion but hes able to deliver predictive results amazingly accuratelybut even then you cant leave it purely in the hands of akita t take technitium for example akita might have suggested making more 10 more tech moons and 30 less titanium moons but that wouldnt have solved a weird problem like the geographical distribution favoring the nc and reinforcing their control over most of 00anyway subject matter experts are probably better than crowdsourcing  especially if you nda them pay them a contractors feeliang
agreed why not simply make the sig of modules small enough not to be hit my the compact citadelsso we need something new which reduces blobs what might you suggestit hinders the small guys they made it so big such that you need a capfleet to take em on this stops stupid roaming gangs from taking on them however they also hinder the small alliance from taking space
i think youve gotten it backwards its often the devs that cant forsee the unusual uses for items and its always the players themselves who are the ones who discover the flaw and exploit it of course any exploits the devs do notice do not even get far enough to be discovered by the playersoverall i agree that game balancing is quite satisfactory but when things are clearly and demonstrably wrong it takes a very long time to get anything done about it and when they start working on a fix it seems to take them a really long time when they could instead throw up some numbers and ask the players to give their opinion about the new xthis is mostly an attempt to address the perception of low productivity in the specific areas that players care about a lot
no certain players are good at game balance when was the last time you perused ships  modules and a game balance thread do you not even remember the bitter disputes between the amarr and minmatar  where one race was so pathetically laughable that nobody flew anything other than rifters hurricanes and vagabondsi know what it is  but i dont think that we can directly use player input as a balancing tool thats why i suggested smes contracting to ccp under nda it simply makes better senseliang
what are smes
subject matter experts for instance akita t would be a subject matter expert for the market imo and sok might be one with supercaps im not sure who would be the best choices for general shipsmodules  its such a divisive topic that even if youre right youll  someone offliang
then you only keep fotm laming forever because majority flies fotm and dont want to lose their solopwnmobiles
sup thats exactly what the csm is ccp already blatantly ignores them year after year stop kidding yourselfedit supported
i must have missed the part where there was a csm that had time to give a detailed presentation on what rocket explosion velocityradius should be and how utterly ing useless the t1 amarr cruiser lineup islianged and in case the implication doesnt hit you the csm delegates are politicians hoping to provide player feedback and hopefully push the general development of eve in a better direction they hardly have time for such small issues as the nighthawk needing some extra gridim also very curious which csm delegate you think rivals akita ts knowledge of the eve economy
the csm are figureheads for blame little else ccp isnt interested much in what players think is wrong with the game they are interested when they agree but not when they do not the devs are pretty hostile towards people who dont agree in person if you have never encountered one if you think they are going to listen to an expert youre a special breed of stupid
result of plex for haiti is that ccp ceo have now brand new shiny jaguar just kidding d
by all meansi mean i should be able to remap my attributes every time i start training a skilli also shouldnt be restricted to having to keep minimal attribute levels and be able to pump all my points in the primary and secondary traitsafter all we all benefit by making my i mean our skill training faster and all you naysayers are just trying to protect those skills i havent trained up yet
nice first troll enters thread
i have a beef with current disconnect mechanicshowever due to circumstances beyond my control i am wireless that is not 100 reliable eve is playable but i do have some disconnects this in and of itself is not a problem what is a problem is the 35 million isk worth of drones i leave in space every time this happens rats of course target the drones as soon as leave space and even though i reconnect right away i will usually lose 1 to 2 drones a single dc a mission pretty much nerfs my payi dont have specific fix in mind for this but i do have a suggestion namely when you dc your drones dc with you provided you dont have player agro in which case you lose your stuffim a gallente pilot mostly focused on drones and many people are trained that way its silly for us to suffer a disconnect penalty now people might say lame drone domi pilots need a nerf good lol but its still a bad mechanic if you want to nerf drones in missions losing them on disconnects is a dumb way to do it might be able to help server load to pretty much end of every fleet flight there are like hundreds of drones in space i could imagine that after a pilot leaves the field ie ship destroyed it would be easy enough to remove his drones using the same code this would cut down the lag and the crap that really doesnt ad much to the game at least let us maintain drone control on dc i dc and my drones are 50km away i basically have to slow boat over to them and get them i come back within seconds of dc but to bad you dc you lose x million haha you losebasically its a dumb way of doing things i think you should punish people for failing tactically not for technical difficulties at least as much as that which can be rationally and reasonably avoided
im pretty sure this is already planned for future development
because ccps server code is ancient and doesnt know how to dynamically allocate resources ill support this but then i also support a more general refresh the server code type proposals as well
this is working as intended it is called risk vs reward which is why the few people with balls to actually run them can also make more isk then most people do out in 00
i wish we could get one of those drama movie prologue closings you know eva 21 days later this just to get an idea of what happened to her in later life so that we can all finish the popcorn and move on to the next movie soap story
please dont be a emo fanboi because you like eva
now that ccp stated most of the resources are already committed for the next 18 months what will the next csm meetings be aboutit appears there is little sense in pitching more proposals since the reaction has to be after incarnadust
this seems to be the six dollar question is csm going to give input on incarna and dust if not then it seems their input is not relevant if csm members are going to give input on incarna and dust then they should make it clear its just their own personal opinions and not claim its the views of the players as a whole no players really know enough about these other games to discuss them or formulate opinions of how they should be developed
this to be fair has to be resolved ccp must invest in polishing game content for a time personally im hopefull they will eventually get the message but were already startinjg to loose long term players like flies we all know of them weve all played with them hell it might be an idea to start a forum and list all the people you know who have left the game due to frustration with this issuehowever id like to explain how the top level managers dont have a clue whats happening through my own experiences of corporate business it goes something like thisstafflow end managers god damnit somethings terribly wrong heremiddle management at the board meetings as you can see were doing exceptionally well in these areas here are some cherry picked statistics showing our great successexecs excellent work youve justified my position to the shareholdersshareholders are we still making money goodrinse repeat until company starts loosing money and low level workers get made redundant followed by asset stripping and eventual sale of the entity descisions made of win
this is probably true  or would be if ccp wasnt a privately owned company owned by the execs
board members are always incentivised by share options its a way to actually try and force them to do well by linking their own personal economic gain through company growth this also explains a lot behind why ceos want immediate growth as theyre generally only with a company for a limited period before they cash in either way however someone is making the cash and basing their descisions on what middle management or whoever is pulling the figures out of their hat at the time are reporting problem is the middle management barrier which is generally based upon the fact that no one wants to say we need to improve in areas x  z because that means either a solid questioning on why there is a problem in the firstplace or an increased workload whilst the changes are being made and hell who wants that ehanyhoo this is just a theory on my behalf so please dont take it seriously i could well be and probably am wrong most of the time
dillons list is excellent and emphasis observation above cannot be overstated enough csm takes an inordinate amount of time if you take the job the least bit seriously i would conservatively guess 12 hours a week more if youre chair and even more if theres drama it is one of the most intenseand sometimes thanklessseemingvolunteer jobs ive ever done and oh yeahbe sure you have a thick skin the hate mail can be epic though
hate mail you like drama alot right i dont like you but hate over a video game only ones i see hating people are usually people like sok and maz just reading their posts confrms most of thatwell i could be wrong about them might just be thei ability to think like a adult as for a csm how about one that actually acts like an adult i get all the kids and the wifes toon to vote for one like that as well as the guys deployed with me that play so far not all but most of the ones i see posting act like they are still in high school
no i dont like dramabut yes some people apparently feel it is important to express how much they cant stand me in personal email whatever floats your boat i guess you cant please everyone all you can do is be who you are do what you said youd do and be consistent about it if people dont like you for doing those things oh well as for a csm that actually acts like an adultits an organization made up of 14 individuals 9 delegates 5 alts each of whom has their own idea of what constitutes proper behavior in these forums and elsewhere there are no organizational rules governing csm behavior besides eulatos so its left up to each delegate to make a choice about how they conduct themselves when someone steps over the line the rest of us may talk with them behind the scenes to encourage different behavior but at the end of the day its like herding cats to get everyone to conform to a given standard of behavior
for once you actually posted something i can agree with you on mynxee as for mail thats funny is the way i meant it as i am still waiting on some goonsbobs noir atlas and several groups that have disbanded to fly over to afie and teach me a lesson or actually goons where supposed to fly over to iraq in 2005 but never made it hahahah just means we been playing eve to long
issuesdevs should play the game this would probably just turn into a discussion more than anything else but ill throw it in here to see how it goes in the meetingcrowdsourcing ship balancingeditclarify the actual changes when updating the eulaapi security and development priority changestamber made me do it
see also this extremely related thread
it doesnt matter whether its a new issue or an old issue or a high priority or low priotity they arent working on eve other than lag pi and maybe some vague combat expansion that wont effect mechanics just information for about 2 years so post your pi proposals and combat information proposals whatever you think that might mean but otherwise enjoy your time in iceland its hard to see why csm shouldnt just adjourn for 18 months and reconvene when ccp might want to get back to working on eve
its one thing to say they are not going to focus on fixing old features before they bring out new ones but here they are saying they arent even planning anything new or old for eve they are simply working on different gamesin apocrypha they gave us a new feature  wormholes some people may be uspset and think they should have fixed older features instead but at least it was an expansion in eve now they are effectively saying they wont do anything for eve  not adding new features not fixing old just working on dust and incarna
the ops claims could be considered slanderous to ccp ccp has not abandoned eve dust and incarna are enhancements to the overall eve universe and experiencethe csm minutes has stated clearly that ccp will devote more resources to fixing issues with existing features after both expansions i think that will be the appropriate though overdue time to carry this out after major expansions that will bring the game to the next level
bullyes in 23 years time
also ccp minerals nerf or maybe  screwup basically have nerfed the drone region terribly after 6 years in this game i am wondering wtf are they thinking i am losing my attention span for this game soon it will be time to start turning accounts off just because i am not doing as much anymore in it owell its been a nice run been messing around on the perpetuum beta a big change that is for sure bored spin ships fastero
yeah and we are all going to abandon eve if ccp doesnt straightentfu and it wont take two yearshow can they use our money to make some other game that ill never play and then tell us that they dont have resources to work on our game for 1824 monthssound familiar much
lol im not going to rage quit over this eve is still a great game but i am trying to communicate my own player opinion that from the tiny bit i know about them i see dust and incarna as basically separate games dust is obviously different incarna although i suppose i will be able to walk in stations with my eve account is of very little interest to me i always thought ok this will be some minor throw in that they are working on i knew my current interest in eve fw was put on the back burner but i had no idea that they basically halted work on everything  missions  fw  null sec  high sec  low sec  wormholes  balancing  you name it  in order to focus in on incarna and dust i mean they do throw us some sort of bone with the combat expansion i quoted that in my op but we or at least i have no idea what that means can we get some idea here what that is because that and lag seems to be the only thing eve related that they have going on
it ceased being your money when you gave it to themc
so your message here is cancel our accounts right if not you musta meant to say something elseedit and by the way  i find this funny though you may not understand  there are still some people to this day who pay soe to play swg
some people would play anything wrapped up in the sw world simply because it is sw that and from what i hear from the single old friend that still plays the game has had some good elements put backmyself i couldnt have cared less about the sw skin id have played the precu game if it was dressed up as smurfs online because at its core it was a good game that like this one needed some balance  polish if theyd have simply made doc buffs percentage based like entertainer buffs and reigned in the most op weapons im falling off topic easy to do with something when youre passionate about iti guess my point is that eve was a great game with huge potential as it was in 2006 many of the features added to the core game have had huge potential for adding great new toys for us to play with in our sandbox but ccp hasnt followed through with their features imo if they feel that a release date has to be a drop dead date to release core functions to a new feature so be it but stay on that feature until its implementation in the live game makes the dev team happy once they get to that point see how that new feature is affecting the rest of the game then decide on actions to take in a balancepolish pass only then should they look around at the core game as a whole and decide if something is missingnotice i said if something is missing not what can we add now if a game is complete polished  balanced it doesnt need to have major new features every 612 months to be popular look at diablo ii  starcraft dii hasnt had a major feature added since lod in 2001 sc hasnt had a major feature added since bw in 1998 theyre both still available at major retailers as a boxed set why because for each of them the core game is complete polished  balancedeve is a great game with loads of potential but the game isnt polished or balanced if ccp would give us polish  balance it would be readily apparent if players felt it wasnt complete and what was missing unfortunately theyve always been too focused on the next big feature to look at where their game is now theyre focusing on features that distract from the core game and leaving them unfinisheddominion traded one sov snafu for another eve did not need pi the bpos for npc goods could have used existing resources and facilities wis is not needed to improve the core game its needed to distract from it dust isnt even the same gamei have no issue with ccp developing other titles but the eve dev team needs to be focused on the core elements of eve flying  destroying internet spaceships with other people for fun every aspect of eve and every change to eve should give a reason to pew pew be a way to pew pew make pew pew more fun or be a way to get more stuff to pew pew with and pew pew on anything else is a distraction from what eve is
probably dont sound lilke we will do it but like a maybe it is as much probable that ccp would spend the resources they have fixing incarna and dust and at the time they will be existing features so that phrase will even be true instead of fixing older content
finally i am catching up on posts take a look at my new post writing low sec stories challenges process tools over in the features  ideas forum i think thats the best place to begin in terms of taking action based on the low sec discussion at the summit i hope this isnt considered crossposting
some previous posts have described a concept without actually mentioning its name complexity classes without going into too much detail when looking at algorithms or computing scenarios at an abstract level you can determine a complexity class which expresses how the computational complexity scales when your input increases an examplea a pure download site the complexity increases linearly with user count n since each download is independent from other downloads you can just add more servers and split the load between themb fleet fights in eve the complexity increases exponentially n2 as all pilots interact with each other even when not shooting each other positional updates etc must be distributed to all of them so not even that many pilots generate a disproportionate amount of load also since they are all part of a single simulation it becomes very hard distributing the loadif interested ive written some about scaling in eve a while ago where i also predicted handover of player sessions between nodes not only that there is no connection between the physical location of the players and in which virtual system they fight that would only make sense if eve was regionally sharded and even then it only helps reduce network lag not server loadthe physics engine is assumed to be deterministic same input  same output also it is not fault tolerant so real desyncs are unrecoverable you need to re the prioritizing of certain requestdata just minimizes the effect of the delay until the client simulation is updated with the authoritative server info ie reduces rubberbanding and the likethats expected multiple systems are simulated on each blade except high load systems like jita or when a system gets reinforced by request the number of systems on a blade is chose according to their average load most 00 systems are empty most of the time  many 00 systems on one blade then suddenly a 250 fleet jumps into one of those systems bringing the performance of all systems hosted on that blade down
how do you think they are working to fix this issue is it possible to set up a separate blade server that is dedicated to managing groups around new eden it can then create dedicated nodes based on groups and figure out where load will beim only a senior flash dev  so most of the hardcore dev is a little beyond me but i understand the concepts around the limitations do you know what ccp is doing to eliminate this problem as eve grows it will only get worsewhy dont they just create a network of 3000 blade servers i know that seems nuts but they arent that expensive it would solve the problem right as technology gets faster they can be upgraded a deal can be worked out with ibm to rent each blade as opposed to purchase  so upgrades to equipment can be quickly made without the financial burden and logistics of reselling the old bladejust a thought i sometimes look at this issue like the oil spill in the gulf lots of smart minds are being put on it but it just doesnt get fixed
so i thought id offer some technical insight i basically make massively scalable server solutions for a living just adding servers doesnt always make things better the problem is that there is context information that has to be shared real time that cant be easly shared across blades as suggested the example of the microsoft game is definitely an apples and oranges comparison the data latency that can be tolerated in a game show game is much greater than a real time 3d space game like eve just think about what you have to share with every other pilot in your system on a real time basis1 your ship type that includes its stats as modified by all your skills implants mods fittings and fleet bomus this includes active changes from items you might have activated this is all caculated real time to take into account energy consumption damage area or targeted effects from other players this all likely gets calculated server side to reduce the possibility or hacks that allow you to uber your ship client side all this has to be shared to everyone in the system or at least in your vicinity if its vicinity that means what is in your vicinity has to be calculated real time as well2 you position path and velocity3 weapons actions this includes missle paths turret activities which involve complicated calculations and remember ship have many guns and missles lots to keep track of and again it has to be shared to everyone real time all this calculations again are dynamic in that they have many elements that can change aspects of the calculations4 static information that can be shared between pilots like your corp alliance your bio your employment history your picture5 elements in the system this currently includes every roid and rat again all these elements are dynamic and can change real time every npc has the same degree of information you have for a ship6 drones all are pathed and have all the same types of data you have to share for a ship7 random other stuff like calculations of area of effect scanning and overview data some of the scanning and overiew could be filtered client side although this can lead to exploits like the one recently found that allowed instant location of other players using packet sniffing8 all the input from the clients of the pilots in the system has to be fed into this as well9 add the overhead of chat voice mail player structuresso start addding this all up for 1000 ships at once and you see you have a huge challenge ccp has thrown some serious hardware at this problem they have a huge ram san for example overall though the challenge is at present sharing this much dynamic data and updating with at times some complicated ai or calculations real time is hard with most common server architectures this is mostly because most applications for massive server deployments dont have the same degree of real time requirements a game like eve does other game companies just solve the problem by capping a server population at a level that is below the threshold of poor player experience and use game mechanics that eliminate the massive sized combat encounters eve promisesi have to say this is a very cool problem to get to try and solve id love to be part of the team working on making this better my customers are happy with a couple of seconds latency so my work challenges are a lot less cutting edgeissler
ccp and the csm remind me of an old saying you can tell when politicians are not telling the truth their lips are moving or in this case when they are on the forums typing
i am currently not telling the truth
players dont care about giving ccp feedback unless ccp acts on itdo you understand what this meansthe players have an interest in improving their state of living within the game for the most part the players dont give the sweat off of a rats balls about the individual comfort of the developers and management some of us do most of us dontas far as the players are concerned if they give ccp feedback and ccp does not visibly adapt accordingly giving the feedback was a waste of the players time if you then tell the players that you are in fact listening that only serves to further irritate them because as far as the playerbase is concerned actions speak louder than words telling the players that theyre being listened to and then acting counter to that is insult to injury to word it more colourfully players dont like being pssed on and then get told that its rainingthis may not be directly your problem or responsibility but it is somebodys problem and responsibilitycreating the csm created an expectation that ccp would adapt to a reasonable extent to fit the desires of the playersthis is the expectation thats been broken here nothing else
oh oh liars paradox amirite

na well get a full line of t3 ships instead
the main problem that i see with them is that they generally have less damagetank than their t1 counterparts while the ability to bridge and move fastish under cloak has some value it still is not enough to make people want to follow the bombersrecons through the looking glassthey need to be worth risking in combat so that they jump with the herd give them marauder gun bonus while keeping highslot  lots more utility highs for supporting friendlies increase base attributes hullarmourshields to t1 level not as if they have full t2 resist bonuses so will only barely top t1 increase damage the more damage the less need for tank so above can be reducedanor make them gang friendly with partial bonuses borrowed from the various titans or ability to use ganglinksthey make great bridge ships now lets make them great at killingdying as well
is suicide ganking really such an amazing game mechanic i wish there was a better way to add risk to mining without such a lame sequence of eventsi think if a system worked similar to how rats work it might be more interesting rats get tougher as the security status gets lower if you could allow players to sign on as mercs with the local npc pirate factions and have limits on hull type depending on sec status it would be more fun you wouldnt be in a hulk facing ganking battleships in a 5 but you might have to be careful of groups of roaming player mercenary pirate frigs  in a 7 maybe the hulls could be limited to tier 1  3 frigs or something similar perhaps limit fleet size as well shrug the pirates of course are freely allowed to attack in belts anywhere really but station guns and gate guns would be hostile to them it will add to the feeling that space gets more and more lawless the farther out you go regular sec status rules could still apply with the addition maybe of after signing on as a merc you would be on a timer limiting your access to 8  10 of course people who are the good guys in high sec have the advantage in being able to field any ship they like which makes sense since this is their turf and its high sec making it difficult for pirates to have access to big ships that draw concords attention  short version is introduce a system to make the regular players rats for short periods of time until the heat dies down remove the insurance payout for suicide ganks and now you have a system that challenges both groups with risks and rewards and its much more in the spirit of lawless space insurance for going kamikaze is just lame and boring if you dont like how im going about it then suggest something to make it better i dont know why anyone would prefer suicide ganks over real skirmishes
1 i was never aiming to change your opinion because once again u r incapable of adapting thats why u cry for this change so badly and thats why u will keep your opinion because u r incapable of even the simplest tasks just to survive in eve if u cant even handle high sec rats how can u even react against another player2 suppose that this change actually goes throughwell just adapt like we always have and while well still continue playing u carebears in your complete ignorance and stupidity will wonder why eve hasnt adapted to u its because u will never adapt to eve and that will never change 3 once again exhumer gankers dont profit from ganking exhumers not that ure capable of understanding in your own little carebear bubble u want to stay in and im well off in isk tyvm of course ud probably never seen much isk because ure too stupid to keep u and your ships alive long story short another fail proposal to turn high sec into low sec at that point ganking wouldnt even be suicide anymore and all of eve will be deserted just like low sec  in other words u cant understand the concept of a sandbox
this strikes me as a common sense suggestion that should certainly have been added a long time agoin no situation should insurance be paid out to anyone killed by concordit would probably also be more realistic to make the insurance premiums based on security statushigh sec status  lower premiums low sec status  higher premiumsits all common sense and none of it is gameruining
eve tries so hard to resemble real life somebody described it very accurately as a second job you have to pay for why not in this pointsomebody said the insurance in eve is not meant to actually be an insurancestop calling it thatif its supposed to be an insurance stop paying money to criminalsregards lax
agree no insurance payout to suicide gankers those who were killed by conrord why should they be awarded if they do such things
nice counter argument its fail because you say so and all of eve will be deserted because you say so look the guys out there who still want insurance for suicide ganking make a good point mining in high sec isnt risky enough npc rats are a joke and without suicide ganking 5  10 doesnt mean anything special except different amounts of ore at belts you want the sandbox but you dont want there to be risk in your words you think it will become low sec with no cruisers t2 ships battleships cap ships and gate camps i fail to see how its the same as low sec players would still be safe at gates and stations you can even up the powerquantity of gatestation gunspatrols to really discourage anyone from trying to make those areas more dangerous than they should which means travel between high sec becomes a little safer since i favour removing insurance for suicide gankingmy idea turns 5  7 mining into areas where carebears can start to get combat in with a known enemy frigates it allows more turn over of ships which in turn makes mining more profitable in the long run more ideas could be pirate threat level alerts or something of that sort in 5  7 perhaps a warning via local by concord or maybe a new interface screen could show pirate activity in the area between low  high or at least a system that gives the carebears a little more of an edge in knowing when they should risk it and when they should run back to 8 or just another system so suicide ganking  sandbox but the ability to join pirate groups and use small ships in 5  7 for pvp is anathema to thatwhy dont you suggest something that removes the suicide gank not much risk for the ganker with insurance and still leaves risk in high sec for miners to worry about aside from can flippers which are so easily ignored better yet support something that involves getting people more involved with pvp and gives high sec good guys an edge over the bad guys which keeps the game in context with the whole null sec  low sec  high sec idea just so you know im not an avid pvp player ive been a carebear most my time in eve and can sometimes win in 1v1 i mine all the time so these changes would make things more dangerous for me ive never been a pirate and doubt i ever will be still id like to see the pirates have more engaging gameplay and not have to resort to bending the rules all the time to have fun

as reported by ccp zulu  20100716 173524csm you saylike many of you i have read the meeting minutes from the csm 5 meetings in reykjavik last month to be completely upfront about it i have to say im quite taken aback by the difference in the meeting minutes compared to my firsthand experience from attending the meetings
the reponse on the csm meeting by ccp zulu is imho very unprofessionalcount the numbers of developers on new toys and minigames and cmpare that the number of devs working hard on bugs you are not even aware ofread the csm reports ccp is not taking its customers serious at all most ideas are being neglected some are put on looooong holds many are sais as maybe yeah sure and the vialble ideas resulted in either a devlog or a promise it will be looked into only intrested in attracking new players way to go ccpa professional corporation would put up a list of know issues by players and work trough it striking though all progress it is makingadding timeschedules to each issue

not a bad turnout i fell we can do better though
iceberg you say new features attract new players and preserve eves longevity not necessary holding back some features in order to preserve longevity are a pretty wise business plan look at blizzard they are an excellent example blizzard wait until everyone is clamouring for more content then they give it before too many people get fed up blizzard generally want their products to be popular for a long period of time not like ccp where new features is only popular immediately after they release a new expansion ccp use new expansionsfeatures as carot blizzard use excellence as carot eve is already a very complex game even for veterans that have played for years adding another level of complexity to eve with pi and incarna are not a wise buisness plan because its premature as example fw and lowsec was supposed to be a stepping stone to pvp and 00 sec that have the potential to vastly increase the player experience for pvp wannabes and lowsec00 sec residents its shocking and disencouraging that ccp dont see just a slight problem in prioritizing new feautures over polishing fwlow sec and others half baked features delusional you sayyes please get a grip on reality excellence dictate that quality outweighs quantity blizzard understand this concept sorry to say but in this ballgame ccp are just wannabes who pretend to be something they are not i love the sci fi concept in eve but damn ccp suck at prioritizing its the loyal eve players that can take alot of credit for preserving eves longevity in 2003 when eve went live many people in the gaming industry thought eve would never succeed they were wrong not because of eve excellence but because a loyal core of eve players kept the community alive ccp tend to forget that look at eveuni and many other old corps and veterans that help new players get trained and interated with the eve community look at the tons of third party programs and resources created to support eve waiting another 18 months to polish old eve features is nonacceptable and show lack of goodwill against the loyal player base that have invested alot of time into eve on a personal level im willing to use my financial might with 100b isk that can support csm in their campaign against new features and to fix old in short im fed up i love eve but see big icebergs ahead and something must be done by csm and the player base to hopefully change this horrible prioritizing of dev teams that vastly favor new features the next 18 monthseve is a sandbox game well then give us some excellence tools and stop producing some half baked chinese crap

solid ideas and totally supported
people some of you have not clicked the little support box on your repplies you need to do this for your support to actually count
fw is deserted because there is nothing to win compared to simple missionrunning gains are an important part of eve  gains and risks and for now im sorry but fw is just a waste of time and iskswhat does fw needrewards for individual players good ones to actually justify putting tech ii frigates on the linerewards for the militia andor the faction to encourage players to play together for a common goal
supported  i cant believe that fw the entry forppl who wanna do pvp is so continously neglected that is more then frustrating and that for a long time now
if nothing else at least fix the bugs improvement of the mechanic as a whole would be better but ill settle for fixing whats broken
yes please
the fix i think we can all agree needs to be made is to make system occupancy do something as of right now occupying a system does nothing more than reduce the cpu and powergrid useage of your robe and wizard hat which is ridiculous i think not allowing enemy faction ships to dock in systems occupied would be a welcome change or at leats charging a docking fee another possible solution would be to increase the rewards from completing a mind numbing plex or system takeover
ccp  it is clear from the csm minutes that not only will you not devote developer time to fixing fw issues but there is not a clear team or individual stakeholder for fw issuesanother thing that is clear from this thread  and many others  is that there needs to be more concensus around what and how to fix before it can be fixed assigning development talent to work on the issues doesnt have to happen right now but we need ccp folks to be looking at the issue making plans designing fixes now assign devs once they have the time but to let these issues go unaddressed because you are busy developing products for new revenue is a slap in the face to your existing clients read your operating income edit edited to support the op
isnt it the pc players subscriptions that paid for all of this they should be rewarded not stupid console noobs 
supported1fw is still even with broken mechanics the best entry into pvp for new playersso if you dont want to loose all those potential subscribers within the 14 day free trial fix it
ccp i question your integrity you take my money but you dont fix the bugs in the current version of eve i support the corrections for faction warfare fit it now
ccp we are paying customers treat us equally before other games take our interest
i decided fairly recently that im finished with faction war until it is fixedor at least improved after a year of trying to make the best of tired ineffective game mechanics i had to move on to find motivation to keep my account active so in my opinion yesfw needs some fixin in a very bad wayi would like to point out something about fw that ought make it worth fixing to ccp the fact that a great many fw players support their play by buying plexes fw is an isksink like no other people do it because they like to fight not grind wealthso lots of militia folk are frequently shelling out the extra thirty bucks to replace their losses that is something that big alliance pilots and highsec corps dont have to doi know that since ive left the militia the likelihood that ill be paying dollars for any more plexes has become pretty much nonexistant i simply dont have to pump that much money in to the game anymoremy point is this i would be incredibly surprised if the profit ccp is making off of pilots per capita involved in fw isnt significantly greater than that which they are making off of those who are not yay woot convoluted sentencemore simply my point is thiscrappy fw  less plexes bought with rl cash
i dont know im fairly new and i really want to give fw a try in the near future the problems i hear people talking about are the metagame being a bit borked and the fw community dieing off coming from war i know that capturing objectives can foster cooperation however the places to be for the best pvp in eve dont seem to be in fwif it was better ccp could retain a lot more players that give the game a try
the problem isnt that they havent fixed faction warfare yet its that they havent removed it yet
blowing up internet spaceships is serious buisness walking on boring stations however is not
but i want a hairdresser and a bar you bastards
hithis sound like an intresting topicfirst of all remove those skills for diffrent reasons i have started to play with 3 chars and each time i did have to train the learning skills which are a painfull process training to 55yes eve are loseing a lot of potensial new players to eve i have several friends who have declined to start play it base on the fact of the learnings skillstraining learning skills taks about 23 months totaly not strange that lot of potensial players are leaving the game because of that
yes please remove learning skillsi would be happy with the proposed solution
yes i am still monitoring the thread i am also gathering some data related to this proposali am of the opinion that this issue is a very important one and i want to make sure the proposal is as tight and useful as possible furthermore after i actually formally raise it on the wiki i want everyone to have a chance to comment on itfor these reasons it may not make it onto the docket for the next csm meeting on the 25thps one thing that people who support the proposal could do to help is rerun the npe and make a list of the tweaks that would be needed if either the ops proposal or this counterproposal was implemented i plan to do this same this weekend if time permits
what about this one treborit seems to me that if the motivation for this change is truly to save the noobs this proposal 100 addresses the concern of new pilots being put off by the learning skills  because those skills wont be available when someone first starts the game a person would have time to get addicted to eve before having the option to train them this is the simplest least invasive and most effective fix to the stated problem of new pilots being discouraged by learning skills this requires no skill redistribution no attribute changes none of the rest of the changes i would expect this idea to be dismissed by those who simply hate the learning skills and who are using protecting the noobs as an excuse to advocate having them removed so they can make alts faster however this approach satisfies those of us who do believe that the learning skills add something to the game that would be a shame to lose and it should satisfy those who are concerned about the effect of learning skills on new players
terrible counter proposal if ccp implemented something like this it would actually  me off way more than leaving existing learning skills as they are this proposal of yours isnt about helping newbies at all its about keeping the statusquo and making it actually worse for newbies it also completely ignores that a good many of us believe learning skills are bad game playdesign irrespective of its negative impact of new player experience
the immediate problem i see is that it slows down initial noob skill acquisition which is exactly what you dont want to do given that noobs are more focused on instant gratification the more achievements they get the more they get sucked into the gameideally every time a noob logs off there should be some some training goal that will be achieved by their next session ie the next day so typically within the length of the skill training queue that will let them try something new  like a new ship or a new aspect of eveof course the ideal is impossible to achieve but the closer you can get to it and the less barriers you put in the way the better
not supported
great suggestioni hope it will be implemented soon 
supportedbut you should remember that ccp confirmed they wont touch fw for at least next 18 months so all this is likely 100 futile

listen to this wise mans wordsapi  yesspacebook  no its a painful waste of resources bring the forum to todays standards and after that you might play around with that other web thingy
supporteddo it the intelligent way
more api is always better personally i think a contracts api would be the best imagine how happy currior runners would be if you could get info on contract location destination collateral and reward it would make moving your stuff in space much easier this info could be imported into a tool so they could plan their route for optimum profit i think this would result in more haulers doing curior contracts for profit which would result in a system thats much easier to move stuff around in while stil being player controlleditd also be nice to fetch price updates on factionofficer items d

tamber told me to do this or they would post the pictures of me and the donkey one drunk friday night
i fully support this idea  all of my accounts do to save spamming this postmainly for two reasons lotteries spam the sell orders because they are long term compared to selling other items so they stick around longer and fill up the forums everytime someone buys a ticket or just get lost  then people respam it having a realistically lower volume forum for them and some posting rules to go with it will clear up the sell orders more and allow people to find the lottories they want to play lets face it  people like to gamble in ev e  and no one wants to read all the lottery ads when looking for stuff to buy when i want to be taxed  as patri puts it lol then i can goto the seperate forum to do so if their was onegoto wwwshipsofevecom  thats one of the best p

i agree with this idea we need a new section for lotteries so we can have the auction channel only for auctions right now most of the threads are for lotteries and as the people like them a lot it will continue that way for a long timeits not like creating lots of new sections but just this one will add value to the forum as let people find what they want much more easily

i would like to propose that the double click to move function become disableablei suggested just a simple tick box in the general settingsthis would be useful for miners mostly for when you are can mining you can occasionally unintentionally double click and not notice untill you are 10 to 20k from your cans
sure altho this belongs in the bag of control improvements like more customization and remapping of fixed keys
similarly if you ctrlclick on overview to lock a bunch ships if you doubleclick one you start flying toward it not good

i think being able to unanchor after a month of off line time is reasonable i cant tell you the number of times we find cold poses in wspace things that just sit there for ever because noone wants to invest the 12 hours it would take to kill them for no gain other than a kill mail
anybody
bumpand maxim weve explained several times now why your proposal is rubbish so until you are willing to accept that which you clearly are not willing to do be sure not to stop
and i explained why you were wrong also you didnt comment on the counterproposal to increase lrar pg requirements by 400
so we now have here one side who is against it because it wont solve anything since it wont do any harm either i then dont see why they are so against it but anyway the other group is against it because it will make shield rr bs gangs op maybe those groups should first try to find out why exactly it would be such a bad idea to give shield transporters normal fitting requirementswhy not do it even if it wouldnt be used in pvp it would then at least be viable for the harder pve content you sok say that it shoudlnt be done because then they would still lack mids well i can assure you now that they wont get more mids and shouldnt get more mids so why not make it at least a bit more viable by normal fitting requirements
great you totally went past the point there if the message was unclear so far let me repeat it for you i do not believe that the requirements for shield transporters are a limiting factor on the proliferation of rr shield bs gangs i also do not believe that the actual limiting factor namely the lack of midslots should be solved in the easiest possible way because that would lead to a number of other possible problems hence we are forced to conclude that rr shield bs gangs cannot work as well as rr armour bs gangs under current game mechanics assuming rr gangs without a major logistical backbonehowever i would be interested to see a fleet consisting of highdamage ravens and rokhs supported by appropriate recon ships scorpions and a load of basilisks the destructive potential of that particular combination would be quite astonishing
70 developers on walking in stations bull that has no real impact on the game and 22 on the game itself something is ing wrong here
tldrbut to answer the question in the title it would appear so that being said eve is still awesome that being said please do what you said you would ccp make everything work and finish unfinished projects ie commit to excellence
ok your points are valid ccp is in fact a company first a company that apparently wants to grow and become a european version of blizzard and have multiple blockbuster titles with a huge fan basestay with me heredo wow fans complain the blizzard has a department developing diablo iii or do warcraft 3 fans complain that starcraft 2 took all the good rts game developers with them to that project no no they dont for several reasons the main being that wow fans have no clue who the developers are blizzard doesnt post dev blogs and they certainly dont have a csm that flies to blizzard hq to give feedback from the player basethe bottom line is that a company like ccp can successfully walk and chew gum at the same time multiple projects doesnt mean that developer a works on dust from 08001200 and then incarna from 13001700 it means they hire more people to scale to multiple projects the new uk office for example along with those in china and atlanta in businessnot on a soap box hereyou either grow or die stagnation will kill a business slowly from the inside look at the matrix online or other mmos that were here and now gone ccp isnt abandoning eve they are trying to add value and dynamic to it by developing dust for consoles and having mercs blow your eve  up on planetsfor lack of a better termas long as we have the csm and ccp continues to support us through them we are in good shape bravo to dierdra vaal for holding ccp accountable but the long term plans have already been set here people the budgets have been drafted the money is allocated to reverse or change course now will be too costly for ccp i do believe however that they will eventually get to our concerns for low sec fleet lagwhich is being workedui overhaul pi overhaul etc these things take time to reach their longer term goal of a new game reaching additional demographics of gamers and growing eve online itself this is the path they have chosen is it aggressive yes will it work who knows thats for the ccp executives to call and be held accountable for i for one dont think this is a bad path to be on as long as long standing bugs and csm issues are addressed resolved and resources are allocated to fix old problemsvod
look how naive you are
excerpt from minutesthat says it all right there new features over quality and polish in other words they dont give a  what you think this discussion is a waste of timethey wouldnt give a damn even if you screamed loud enoughand the csm is powerless to stop itsorry to burst your bubble protest or not were at the mercy of greed
imo eve works deacent yes there are some poblems with fleet lag but that is a problemon every single mmo except for wow but they get rid of lag by capping numbers in a instance if you get 600 people on 1 grid all doing different things the server is going to bog down a bit there is only so much bandwidth available yes there are bugs but ccp does spend alot of time fixing them the ones that do get overlooked for a long time are hardly game killers the thing is eve stays a active viable game because new stuff keeps coming out i seriously doubt i would still be playing the game with out the wormholes and pi has been a god send for those times when i have nothing else to do
i think most people that are concerned are 00 players how long is it ago that we had a decent pvp patch all i see are bear patches and eve is gettting laggier and laggier for pvp seems there priorities are wrong wormhole  bear patchmission thingies  bear patchfw  small bear friendly pvp and farming bear patchsystem upgrades  bear patchnew sov  pvp patchepic arcs  bear patchevegate  uselesspi  bear patchwhere are all the pvp improving content ie the numerous broken ships bos deimost lach
ccp isnt overstretched theyre understaffed
absolutely supportedccp is using the income generated by eve to make world of darkness and a console gameneither of these relates to internet spaceshipsso based on available numbers something like 5 of my 15 a month is being used to pay for people to work on the game i play
this is like ultimate luxure that company is so transparent as ccp they took time explain how they allocated resources in order to achieve selected goals which is pretty amazing look at other companies you dont see nothing nowhere like this besides i guess thats true that ccp fixing team is working on a variety of bugs behind the scenes im sure there were a lot exploits bugs and various other problems with the code which should be fixed and if you dont see it it does not matter that no work is done to my liking their choice of development is amazing i think incarna and dust link implementation is exactly the right choice of tasks for now in order to really improve the game
void bombs now show me on the doll where the domiishtarcurse touched you
so you want to make gallente even weaker by giving people a single module to completely nullify the dps of their drone boatsno ing way
this is a pulse which when it hits the drone it incapacitates the drone the controller loses all control of the drone
actually i just recently broke 10mil sp in drones 90 of the time im in sin ishtar domi or thanny primarily sin
then you should realize this would completely shut down every drone ship with a single module i have 15m sp in drones
sure as soon as you give us thisemp weapon disable pulsethis is a pulse which when it hits onboard weapons it incapacitates them the ship loses all control of the onboard weapons theyll need to fly to the nearest market and purchase new weapons to fight
terrible proposal and you dont even give a reason
my proposal is to have more heavier dungeons in eve the heaviest dungeon is at the moment a sanctum i would like to see new dungeons added with atleast a dubble spawn of rats 12 to 18 bs rats per wave its way more fun to interact on that way with people and shooting stuffs
its called anomaly and yes they are too trivial therefore supported
lfm naxx 25
swing by wormhole space some time a class 6 anomoly plus capital escalation sounds like what youre after plus sleepers are slightly less morosethan empire rats bit more challenging
theres not much here to explain my argument because its self explanatory that this would improve eve in the long run just spend 30 seconds googling it if you dont know what this standard is about here ill do it for you hell even if it doesnt improve eve it will probably improve ccps profits they should be all over itif ccp is already certified why do i not see that certificate proudly stated on the websiteoh and while were at it how about getting iso20000 certification this would especially improve the gm department and could help with the cluster management but then again its quite possible the size of ccp does not yet justify this and iso27001 certification for improved securityyeah thatd be cool
supporting my own proposalalso here are some more standards relevant to what ccp is doingiso15504iso12207cmmior hey how about hire a process management guru if you dont have one already people complain about ccp focusing on shinies all the time and getting distracted from issues at hand so how about doing something about this by bringing some order into chaos
how about you start your own mmo development company and do it better than ccp with your ty certificates
having had to endure the 90012008 audit just two weeks ago gtfo theres nothing more senseless in a company below 100000 employees than this ing shifting of paper mounts its gms brainchild and one should have let them go bust over it
no thanks busy working myself to death at a service desk that struggles to be compliant how about you go and learn about the importance of process management to ensure cost savings delivery on time and customer satisfaction and start your own consulting firm also ccp already uses agile since red moon rising and scrum since apocrypha so this shows they are on the right track
this is truly the dumbest idea i have ever seen including all my own
is it dumb because you dont understand what it isi personaly think a company with such a client base should have this kind of certification and process in place
so what you are saying is this forum should be removed since ccp is the allmighty and should not be questionedthat said it is ty ideaiso9001 doesnt suddenly make your decission making process good it only makes it cost alot of paper
forgot your support i agree it does not make it good or bad nor does it make the decisions better but at least it makes the process leading to decisions consistent which as we all can see is very much not the case with ccp
complete waste of time and resources they could be using to you know do game stuff
please forgive me if this idea has been posted beforeanyways i noticed that there is no way of tracking who puts in what items and what quantities into the corporate hangar arrays cha like any other corp in eve the corp that im in employs a multitude of these arrays in our poses but we have too many members in our corp to keep track as to which items or ores belong to who back then it was only a matter of which tabs to put them in for each member or division but as our numbership grew this method is proving to be cumbersome even anchored giant secured containers gsc only provide a temporary solution to this problem due to their limited capacity compared to the volumes we put in towards the chasi think it would be nice to have a feature built into the chas that allows highranking corp members ie ceo directors etc to see who has put in which items and how much of it this could also help miners rest assured that their ores are properly accounted for when they get paid for it
its just surprising that ccp has chosen to take the stand that they do not care about maintaining the quality of their game all they seem to be interested is in increasing the subscriber base which will lead to higher sales and increased profits while i understand that is important for every company it seems to be a very short term vieweve has lasted for so many years and been a success because the quality of the game has been maintained along with the addition of new content both are essential to the success of the game focusing on one and ignoring the other will just lead to a loss of business in the long runi doubt any of the players who claim they are going to quit the game will do so while i am very unhappy about the direction that ccp has gone with this i intend to play this game i love however as aspects of the game become unplayable players will leave the gameeventually ccp being a company that is interested in profits will come back to this issue and work on maintaining the gamei just hope they realise sooner rather than later to my knowledge ccp does not lack the financial resources to be able to ensure they add new content while maintaining the game
nope sorry dude ccp thinks a 3d chat room is more important
its a simple fix that ccp should be able to slip in there even with their refocused priorities
vengeance and heretic reporting in also a 150 bonus to explosion velocity is good but not enough rockets need at least a 20 buff in base damage in addition to that to even approach the usefulness of 150mm autocannons on the aforementioned shipsin addition a reduction in fitting requirements to around the same as 125mm150mm acs would be very beneficial rockets just use too much fitting resources on top of being so crappyccp will get around to fixing rockets but one thing wont change disappointment ive been waiting forever and ive been disappointed time and time again reading the patchnotes and noticing the apparent complete apathy of ccp towards this issue when they do buff them the changes made will do very little to make them competitive against other short range weapon systems which in the end is what matters not arbitrary exclamations of necessary  buffs to damage ect
youre pretty much spot on herei left the damage increase out of the op because the fundamental problem with rockets lies in the explosion velocity but the way i see it is that if you can get them to where they are doing full damage to a properly tackled target then their eft dps should be slightly lower than the other frigate weapons to account for other systems not doing full dps trackingfalloffbasically the idea is to put them on par with the other weapons not make them the new overpowered fotmanother point to consider would be an increased clip size rockets run out of ammo much faster than other frigate weaponsbut i cant stress enough that explosion velocity is the 1 issue
there is already a fix rockets thread thats been going for over a year linkagethe discussion about whats worng with rockets is in this thread there are many more problems with rockets than just the ev
was told all i love would be killed if i didnt supportdoes need fixing i just dont see ccp giving a  about what would really improve the game though
this is actually sensible considering we have a multitude of options to use for paying for our subscriptions we should have relatively the same choices for paying for other eve goodies
you may take into consideration that in some countries credit cards are alot less commonas for example in the united states i life in germany i could get a credit card if iUFFFDd ask my bank for one but they wouldcharge me a fee for it and i basicly had no use for it when i shop online i almostexclusivly pay with paypal in my circle of friends there are just two individuels who do own a credit cardthere is no way i could convince them to enter their ccdetails into a website likeeveonline for ccp it should not be a technical or beurocratical difficulty since they alreadyaccept other means of payment for account subscription aswell as for their merchandise shop
occasionally when we log in we have to scroll through the new eula before we can do anything else i dont know if ccp cares about people reading it but sometimes there are new rules introduced that concern player conduct and i think it might be best if the bimonthly eulascrolling ritual was changed so that the actual differences were highlighted and the really important changes are explained at the top in plain english and short sentancesdid you know that when you sell your character you are required to send a corp email saying so before you send it on its way neither did i and its been a rule for a while now
there is loads of quirky stuff in the eula that i bet most dont know about for example its against the eula to pretend to be the original owner of a character that you have bought
just make a separate entry possibly at the character stats as race bloodline etc showing the date joined eve this is what 95 of people looking at employment history are looking for doing background checks on a new recruit is certainly important enough to warrant those few seconds of loading time to get accurate info
something simple a patch dedicated soley to pvp give us some new content maybe a new range of hacs maybe a new ship class but something simple and inexpensive tech iii ship are rubbish and dont satisfy the void since the tier 3 ships were introduced so please its time the pvpers of eve got some love
because nobody good ever uses t3 in pvp amirite
supported with additions make the ammatar an allied faction to amaar allow minmatar pilots to join ammatar factionwould make derelik a more interesting area perhaps would also allow jarizza iirc to sprout as a more independent trading hub than rens or amaar
she made me embarrassed to call myself a carebear how can i sell my inventions if stuff doesnt get blown up
well i just got around to reading these and i must say its disappointingthere was a lot of wait 18months fr bug fixes and no real commitments to fix the issuesi hope that the csm will be able to post the list of issues in the backlog publicly will be good to see whats going on and be able to see its progress to being deliveredbut my biggest disappointment is that ccp cant spare a small team of devs to work on the polish of the game im sure even a team of 3  5 could make a huge impact working on the little things surely they can spare that many to keep people subscribed to the game
monkey island  best game
i suspect that the upper management of eve would sell their daughters to a renegade klan biker gang before they let the csm get within 30 meters of anything to do with dust or incarna
in ccp zulus new blog he basically acts like you guys are crazy for reporting that ccp has all their resources for the next year tied up on incarna and also suggests that the csm minutes are factually incorrect or incomplete and give people the wrong idea of what the ccpcsm interaction really was likethen in the rest of the blog he pretty much confirms everything you guys have been saying about ccps general direction and attitudes also i thought the minutes were reviewed by ccp before being postedso regardless of what our opinions are on those directions and attitudes i was just wondering if any of you wanted to comment on the general tone he was taking with the minutes and these rumors and half truths you guys are spreading around not trying to start anything i just wondered what your reactions werethanks in advance
im not fussed everyone at an event will come away with a different impression the csms job is to report on events in a manner that accurately reflects their opinion and perspective we did that in the minutes in blog posts on twitter and via other social media ccp zulus dev blogand responses in that thread curiously none from zulu in the first 17 pages and othersare just ccp doing the same for themselvesif a bit late to the party the evidence pretty much speaks for itself players are smart enough to see it and furthermore to read between the linesof greater concern to me is csms lack of any effective timely communications channel with ccp i dont see how csm can work productively with ccp on behalf of players if that situation is not addressed in a more satisfactory way by ccpthe role and objectives of the csm going forward is a topic under discussion among csm delegates if the status quoparticularly with regard to communication and response to csm issueson ccps side does not change it seems to me that the csm will have to evolve in ways that will allow it to work on players behalf in spite of roadblocks and lack of communication from ccp to be honest i think that evolution has already begun however where we go from here is not clear yet
you go mynxeefwiw have entire confidence in you and the other csm
i agree its great the csm is finding a way through the bureaucratic tangle is it appropriate for someone on the csm to give us an inkling of what alternative methods might be in the offing or is that premature at this point in time delilah
we are only just starting to think about itits still at a conversation level at this point im sure whenif any strategy changes are determined youll see that reflected both in our social media outlets and actions
to the honoured csm team your understanding of the agile development method whether deliberate or accidental is music to my product management earsyou are absolutely 100 correct in saying that there should be fast small changes instead of large changes once resources become available if the csm meeting minutes are a true representation of ccps dev processes i would suggest reading up on the agile development method further and offering this proposal to ccp at your next meeting suggesting they understand what they are trying to achieve by changing their dev methods
agile development akin to adaptive management in environmental affairs interesting and helpful concept for this situation delilah
hey there delilah
hi captain how are you doing i see finnagain is up to his usual antics for those of you new to this thread or searching for background information on ankgate a relatively comprehensive overview and set of links can be found on the friends of eve blog look under the csm category since ank is gone and most people seem to be able to move on this is primarily of historical interest but i trust it will come in handy one day enjoy delilah
i know your desire to deceive and trick people on behalf of ank is really really strong but who do you think youre going to fool with such obvious and laughable lies seriously many csm members agreed that ank had indeed chucked a spoon at meissa those were people who were there but youre still lying about itjust like during the campaign when we had actual quotes from ank with actual links to the threads that proved not one word was changed and you lied and claimed that they were debunked your tactic seems to be the big lie but as long as people catch you out and point out your transparent dishonesty youre not going to trick anybody honestly do you lie so much due to some sort of damage or are you hoping to accomplish something shall we add paranoid to the mix you think that i not only read your blog hah but take the time to comment on it anonymously youre funnyoh and a reminder that you lie constantly due to being a partisan shill surely since you dont just lie to try to protect ank even after shes been removed in disgrace you can link to your many certainly posts where you demanded that she be removed from the csm right right
ive been keeping up and i have to say they seem to be trying very hardi see ccp shutting them out over and over again and not treating them like actual stakeholders but thats to be understood because ccps main interest has to be its own survival which unfortunatelyhonestly cant come before making players happyccp is a buisness after all not a government agencytldr i approve great job csm
anyone who doesnt see the value in getting ccp to admit that were getting no new content at all til 2012 is unreachablefor that alone the csm deserves our thanks
i support ankh oh wait
theres not much here to explain my argument because its self explanatory that this would improve eve in the long run just spend 30 seconds googling it if you dont know what those standards areif ccp is already certified why do i not see that certificate proudly stated on the websiteoh and while they are at it how about getting iso20000 certification this would especially improve the gm department and could help with the cluster but then again its quite possible the size of ccp does not yet justify this and iso27000 certification for improved securityyeah thatd be cooledit ugh this was supposed to go into the assembly hall not here god damn it firefox
they dont have a big sense of humor over at ccp it seems
my god its as if someone thought of this idea before
my god its as if someone thought of this idea beforehmm a crime and punishment forum is for crime and punishment the main crux of getting a functioningmore peoplelow sec is how to make evry aspect of it more apealing to as many as possible so would need input from mission runnerstradersmanufactorsinventerssingle player pvp players and corps so yea somebody has thought it beforebut as you see its all in 5 diffent forums 1 forum for all parts would make an already near impossible job of collating a little more effeciant
clearly you do not read crime and punishment
na i am a mission runner i read the mission runner forum
this explains everything
yea i thought it would says nothing but does explain the problem
nice trick trying to dilute the impact of the csm message by claiming it is not representative of the player base but no dice its not workingplease note most of the issues raised by the csm have nothing to do with specific playstyles and social groups and a whole lot more with fundamental core gameplay mechanics which are broken and have been for a long time and the fact players want ccp to stop for a short while and focus on fixing these issues instead of allocating most of the resources to chasing after new subscribers interestingly enough this csm appears to be one of the most united in its purpose ever make you ccp realise that contrary to all your claims of excellence and wonderful state of the game this is not the case you cannot ignore your existing playerbase and dedicate everythgin to potential new subscribers this attitude will kill eve
you forgot  40 new skills to go with the new t3 ships that take 2 years to get to lvl5
indeed
guys guys ccp is too busy working on first person games for the next 18 monthsbut i support for the lulz regardless
i am subbed till fall of 2014 ill be around to push this at least that long and who knows maybe by then after all this mmofps and wis pi stuff is done they might have room for poss either way i have been pushing this since early 2007 and i see no other threads that are half as well organized supported or any other plans by ccp that will improve what we call the junk in space that is the player owned station until something can replace this that is equally as good this will remain on my list of things that ccp needs to do even if they dont want to mess with pos code or its to hard
gentlepeoplea question from your friendly neighborhood csm who btw mentioned the dead horse issue in his platformassume for a moment that there is no way in hell that ccp is going to totally revamp poss note for avoidance of tinfoil hattery i have no knowledge of ccps plans to do or not do anything about this issue nor have i had any conversations with them about itin such a circumstance what functional changes in the current pos system would you want
a while ago id have asked for copy and invention slots to be made available across the alliance and the implementation of that fuel pellets idea that was being looked into
better resists better fitting better jump range extra dps would be nice but better targetting so it can be a rrsupport ship for the covert fleet would be nicer i thinkbut id rather you just give it a covops cloak
big bump
its fail and all of eve will be deserted because u want to remove high sec and turn it into low sec is any of this getting through to uexactly my point1 u fail to see it because ure too stupid to ooh limit fleet sizeoh wait who says they need to be in one fleet ull still have the blobs and any antipirate stupid enough to engage will get baited and blobbed just like in low sec way to be an idiot 2 this proposal is only really aimed to boost afk autopiloting hauling which is probably what u really wantthe only turnover of ships that will happen will be the miners mission runners and any antipirate stupid enough to engage the multiplefleet blobs then missions and mining will still be unprotected especially with the antipirates now dead against the blobs so belts and mission deadspaces be deserted as a result just like low sec great idea right cause pirates never roam huh with so many pirates roaming ull be lucky if u can even stay for 5 minutes in a beltdeadspace assuming u dont get ganked before thenthose options already exist atm all u want is to extend low sec pirating to depopulate high sec of all producers 1 because this is a sandbox not low sec low sec and more low sec2 because this isnt good vs evil its everyone vs everyone
u can claim to be whoever u want to be just like every other carebear the fact is your proposal will only boost low sec pirating past low sec with multiplefleet blobs to get around your ed system clearing high sec of everyone else just like low sec furthermore u want to boost afk autopilot hauling but heres the thingwith no production what exactly r u gonna haul and fyi we r following the rulesure just too stupid to understand themnevertheless if who u claim to be is true then that does explain your total lack of perspective your ignorance and last but not least your stupidity but plz continueim really looking forward whatever nonsense u idiots will continue babbling
yes its getting through you dont like the idea and you think everyone will quit im not suggesting chopping up 5  10 into pirate zones 8 and up will be free of this hell you could confine my idea to 5  6 for all i care im just brainstorming i like how you have to throw personal insults in every chance you get anyways i understand there could be blobs of multi fleet pirates okay fine i and 3 friends bring battleships outfitted to pop frigates like cheap party balloons i dont think youre understanding how limiting it is to be restricted to only frigates as a pirate so i guess its impossible to fight a few blobs of frigates which are confined out of stationsgates i had no idea high sec players were so defenseless exactly they have to keep roaming so hopefully any pirates are doing quick hit and runs and moving on means if i survived an attack or i know they are there i dont have to wait long before risking getting some sweet sweet golden omber i cant get in 8 thats not at all what i want i am a high sec producer maybe i want less one man with 3 account corps being as competitive as a small tight knit corp that knows how to defend itself vs frigsactually i think youre wrong there maybe it can be anyone vs anyone but good vs bad is all relative so if you want to knit pick that go right ahead if you need me to be 100 correct in my definitions then fine its high sec non pirates vs high sec pirates which currently is high sec minersindies vs suicide gankersanyways thats the last ill really say on this as its beyond the scope of the op i do agree with removing the insurance on suicide gankers but that fix alone doesnt fix other problems imho right now low sec is rewarding if you can use it its just no one feels the risk is worth it however im sure we can all agree going from relatively peaceful high sec into low sec is a slap in the face and can be a tall order for most small corps with little pvp experience im just trying to think of ways to introduce players gradually to the enjoyable pvp aspect of the game maybe the answer is to add a mid sec instead of my initial proposal 1  3 can remain low 4  6 can be mid with some pirate pvp in frigs and 7 and up can be safe everywhere including belts maybe ill post a proposal formally and see if getting the community brainstorming on this can help shrug although if everyone responds like anna maybe im wasting my breath
seconded for common sense
who would like the idea of more low sec when ppl cant buy any ships cause the markets empty it makes no difference how this is confinedlow sec is low sec u just wanna remove high sec for more low sec plain and simple emptying more space and crowding yourself into the highest sec space as well as the other carebears assuming u r who u claim to be which i really doubt try coming up with a wellthought out proposal this is the assembly hall not features and ideas u halfassing moronand ure not understanding how battleships cant kill anything they cant lock or track let alone a blob of them of course u r a stupid carebear who knows absolutely nothing about pvp after all thats why the insults r there it is for u because news flash its not high sec anymore and conversely ure confined to gates and stations u could step outside those areas if u dont mind getting farmed for killmails great thinking again moron right because pirates never roam back and those will be the only pirates that will ever come through the system  you dont even know how to defend yourself against frigates were u expecting to give your corpmates fail advice to pad your enemies killboards good job on being a fail ceojust because ure not shooting someone doesnt mean ure not competing against them whether its zapping the same asteroid or market sales of course someone like u obviously doesnt have the mental capacity to grasp this concept
alright anna enough battleships can lock and track frigates if they use the right modsguns im suprised you didnt know that im happy to have informed you yes i know you can theory craft a fight where i die horribly to your carefully crafted counter everything in eve can be countered so lets not get into that anyways there is no point arguing any further as you are simply presenting worst case scenarios in which the opposing side cant fight back despite having access to ships with 200x the hp and the ability to field more guns per ship while having the law on their side if people cant handle this even in high sec a little then i doubt ccp can do anything to entice people further to low sec since the people you describe fighting the pirates cant organize fight back play smart or manage the risk you must have a very low opinion of most the players in eve my original post was that i just wanted some constructive criticism to hash the idea out and that includes addingchangingdeleting parts of it if you cant reply without getting your back up and without name calling then fine go find someone else to trollquit wasting my time  draek
heres an ideatry coming up with a wellthought out proposal instead of a ed halfassed idea that fails so much u cant even back it up at all then instead of crying so much to nerf suicide ganking escape it by going into low sec if u think its really worth it actually do something about it for once instead of throwing out stupid spontaneous ideas in the assembly hall oh no ure not wasting your breath at all because in retrospect its very entertaining watching stupid carebears like u fail repeatedly with your crap that u call proposals so by all means continue
oh im sryr u running out of halfassed ideas to throw out or do u have nothing left to defend your current ones funny how ure already throwing out a proposed counter yet u supposedly dont want to theorycraft maybe u just dont want another refute cause u cant even handle forums so go ahead at the risk of being a  go ahead and prove your fit that will counter a frigate blob unless u affirm that u know absolutely nothing about pvp or eve in general news flash for your stupid ignorant carebear brain 1 most of the players in eve r pirates2 the bolded part describes the stupid carebears aka yourself that refuse to learn from their mistakes and adapt and expect ccp to hold their hand u ppl r the ones ing and crying about this like u said ccp cant help u if u wont help yourself for the millionth time this is the assembly hall not features and ideas wow u brought this on yourself when u gave halfassed ideas in the assembly hall and expected no one to counter your ed halfassed arguments if anyones wasting your time its u for failing even more than your fail ideas
well if ideas and features is the place to put this my apologies for not putting it there sooner and no its not like i didnt expect people to counter my idea or even be against it i just didnt expect them to be asshats about ityoure an asset to the community anna thank you for your clear concise remarks

supported if i missed supporting this one before
supported fix it in this order 1 lag2 update the sounds most of them have been the same since 20043 bring back the old cyno effects d
a lot of people want things fixed but no one is explaining how these things are brokenone common example im seeing is claims of pi being broken because new players can use it how is this a bad thing the market used to seed items automatically in order to meet demand players now have the option to produce those very same productswhat about the production ui its not perfect there are certainly small changes that i could see working for example instead of creating multiple filters for corp alliance and public they could be configured with different colours or giving individual players outside of alliances the ability to rent slots but those might not fit into the grand scheme ccp has set up other than that id say its close to perfect as it could be what bugs are there with factional warfare once again i wouldent call it perfect based on the rewards and perhaps from a story perspective its not perfect because more players prefer active armor hardeners to faction webs and passive armor hardeners but the system worksi agree that many of the bones weve been tossed have felt lacking but i dont think theyve necessarily been hollow shells planetary interaction gets criticized for the thats it style of game play it has but thats not a fault of pi but more the expectations of the players on the other hand incarna has been identified as an eyecandy feature which might earn an expansion of players from the likes of microsoft vchat moove or imvu while evading the issues brought forward by a core group of eve players among them being lag or the issues created with the introduction of the new sov warfare system but ccp can only work at the pace that their research data allows  keep connecting to those sisi test fleets you miserable jackassesas an aside i wonder how many 00 players commonly viewed as a minority of players actually run empire alts id put the number at a third to a half based on the csms results where virtual nonames representing nullsec alliances are instantly propelled into the csm superstardom im not sure im far offone area id like to see figured out is cosmos agent rewards and perhaps a rebalancing of faction reward distribution yes i know the gallente didnt invent microwarpdrives but japan didnt invent automobiles either

incarna will be introduced with a whole new batch of bugs of its own if ccp cant fix the stuff thats broken now due to misplaced priorities what makes anyone think they will suddenly prioritize these fixes 18 months to 2 years from now after a whole new host of broken features are addedi support this topic not just for fw but low sec in general and to show ccp that they need to focus on the game we have today not 2 years from now
not supported i dont engage in fw and would like wisincarna furthermore wisincarna in needed for dust which is needed to bring more life in pi
i apologize i did not realize participation in faction warfare was so widespread if amends to it could be proven to not only retain players currently involved in it but grow participation from the rest of the playerbase as well as attract new players to eve to a greater extent than incarna and dust 514 then yes it certainly deserves more developer attention however i do not believe that this is the casei played warhammer online for the first year that it was out and it was built from the ground up to be based on realm vs realm faction vs faction pvp it had many great mechanics for people to form ad hoc groups to accomplish both pve and pvp tasks the progression of the greater pvp war was based on smaller pve objectives any of which could quickly turn into pvp engagements sound familiar the combat had a nice skirmish feel and the game got a lot of things right warhammer online is now also widely considered a massive failure its subscribership numbers dropped off a cliff why in small part due to the normal implementation hiccups that almost all mmos face bugs server problems imbalance issues etc but what really killed it was that from the very beginning the concept was flawedby dictating the players opponents by an arbitrary choice at the beginning of playing one more based on roleplay aesthetics or so and sos side is or isnt the current underdog etc rather than allowing all conflicts to be born out of individual player choices and interactions the burden of giving pvp conflict any personal meaning went to the developers so the developers would try to come up with more and better ways to dynamically rewardpunish the victors and defeated with various game itemsrankslimitationsperks these things soon get old and people soon realize that such a system devolves into gaming the system itself instead of each otherrealms factions would occasionally achieve widespread cohesion and accomplish all of the goals dictated by the realm faction conflict mechanics after which rehashing such accomplishment would become trivial faster than the devs could pile more new content or incentives on top of the heap each side would soon devolve into chaotic sparring against people they might rather be ridingflying with but hey theyre part of such and such faction so were supposed to kill them while wishing they could kill some of their very own realmfactionmates or into cliquey semiorganized groups that effectively gamed the system for maximum profit and then eventually got bored of it and quit tldr  faction warfare as a larger concept is a dead end many proposed improvements to it would make it less player driven and more dev driven and there are way more compelling things for the csm and devs to be spending their time on revamping low sec new features that will for a certainty result in playerbase growth things that add on to the sandboxyness of eve rather than spoon feeding more of it etc
more people would come into the game through incarna than any fw fix fw is horrible for new players because it tanks their standings with the opposing factions and it teaches them the only effective pvp is battleship and up blobsplus incarna solves a real problem the game is boring half the time when you are waiting for skills to train currently its just grinding isk and looking for trouble this adds more things to do fixing fw doesnt its just to benefit the small number of people doing itthe metagame is as borked as the rest of the games pvp plexing isnt much different than playing timezone games to nail a pos or using spies station games and neutral altsreppers thing is there is no shortage of pvp opportunities in the game and the fixes a lot of people mention for fw really wont get new people into it if it can be fixed at allmetagaming will never be and thats a large part of what makes fw badyou wont have a game in 2 years if they waste time trying to fix unfixable things they have to focus on what will bring in new people because in 20102011 you are going to start seeing population in eve decay even further simply because new aaa games are coming outlowsec cant be fixed most of the fixes are harmful in general and would actually lose players like lowsec routes only between empiressome things can be fixed and polished and there is a problem when they dont work on more basic things because of it but lowsecfw is impossible to fix imo
a troll a clueless person a player whos bitter that they invested time in a game they dont like you decide now back to your regularly scheduled program
i did fw on the amarr side and there is no way to fix the thing most of the problems with fw are metagame ones that wont go away the militia channel being a refuge for alt spies and the inability to make fw occupancy matter without it being exploited just like the fw level 4s are look at navy slicer prices freefalling for an example lowsec too ive soloed in it most of the time that ive played most of the solutions here to lowsec break the game because for pirates to exist you have to force hisec bears in there to lose their ships any other changes already are covered by wormholes bettermy point still stands fixing both wont draw people to the game eve players have too much tunnel vision about the nature of the game being one way and dont realize the benefits of incarna bringing people in
fix existing game features now plz
yeah i think i trolled myself thats a weird experience anyways i agree and am quite looking forward to incarna it should make the game a more interesting place and may lead to improvements in many places far more then any fw fix would managelowsec and fw as a subsection of lowsec though some may not agree with me on that however have a lot of opportunity to grow and improve there is a lot of potential for fun game stuff that could be made with those two products they arent as hopeless as you make them out to be obviously not with forcing carebears to lowsec or something like that and honestly who wants em anyways let them rot in highsec if thats their thing but working with the nature of the area and the people who live there and emphasizing thatanyways im for letting them finish incarna so when they actually start to improve the stuff theyve already put in game they can actually focus on it properly rather than a bunch of bandaid fixes that bog the game down with nonsense also its likely that incarna could also give them that ability to gather more resources overall assuming an influx of new subs
i think that this proposal is a better solution but this is certainly better than the current system
no no no no no no no nodont like them dont train them stfu
total support
i believe this has been discussed several times before and was approved  i do not see it implemented for the forseeable future though given ccps schedule i hope it can be made part of a fw overhaul in the midterm we will be sure to push for it
supported another one for ccps backlog to be considered when dev time and server performance allows it write access via api authentication to evegate functions which apparently has an xmlrpc backend already anyway would be real nice though as im sure any player implementation of those features will be better and more compatible than the backwards official one they have so many people working on
this will be dealt with when i can mine ice in hell
im a rocket man here on page 10
tamber made me do it
tamber made a lot of people support and post without supporttamber should get some prioritiesi think it is a good idea and some tamber shaped clouds stare angrily at me until i do it
no
could you elaborate on the noits a relatively simple change that would help many people its also optional so you can either have it on or off i dont really see any problems with it
what he means his ctrl  space  0ms s easy isntbtw that doubleclick feature is very useful and fast in pvp
lol somebody has a faulty script i see and no 
yes it is very fast in pvp but thats why its optional do you people not get that  leave it on but there are times when it would be nice to have it off
agree
this is driving me insane and i know i am not the 1st person to complain about itplease fix the noncontrasting colors of the probe boxes when you are scanningthe colors are too close to the background colors even worse when you dive below the plane of space illustrated by the 2nd picture1st picture  shows how horrible the colors are below the plane
thats stupid make them illuminate if put against darck background simular issue arises when probes are put against a bright background you cant see the scanning spheres as an alternative blur background a bit and adjust its brightness so the probes can be easelly seen against it
good idea supporting
yeah this is one of the few things about the new scan system that really bugs me
i r agree cuz lag make me 3
this is s very technical proposal i will support itbecause it is definately worth loocking into but it raises a number of issues that might stand in the way for example how do stacked drones receive damage can a single drone be hit the drones have to have the exact same coordinates when firing otherwise transversal and optimal will be different for each drone and damage calculations will need to be done separately for them which makes stacking them useless will they move as a single entity will they be inside eachother will they be made into swarms where drones are so close to eachother that any difference in transversal and optimal is negligible and an average is used for all of them
what s up with small smart bomb on drones if they are all nbombed due to proximity they all die if they are wandering around there is a chance some survive
a good idea that wont work as locking one drone locks the entire flight of drones while this is not so bad an issue when youre shooting them where the destruction of the first drone in the stack breaks the lock requiring another locking cycle for the next drone in the stack its an easily exploited hole when using remote repair or other support modules on thembut yes you are right drone swarms in fleet fights are a part of a big lag beast of their own methods to limit that do need to be explored
this would be very helpful
oh yessss 
actually they just passed one of my recent suggestions to align to bookmarks so thats not entirely true but living in a wh we constantly have to update bm cans and go to it and drag and droprefill it etc and if no one replaces and it runs out well were just sol so im with you 150 on this one definate 1
must have feature
i could go for this
so why then have the time tables of everything that the dev team is to work for the next 18 months at least set in stone and practically none of the concerns eaised to the csm ion that list no fw fixes at all so in fact it will be 4 years after implimentation that this system is even looked at i know fw players are the red headed step child but come the hell on publically admit it at least or give us a firm date and a dedicatated dev or just flat out say that you dont want our money and end fw
wrong its being followed very well on massively and they generally dont have a shortage of news to report
idk about increasing difficulty and max blueprints 3 runshonestly i think there is too much here for someone to agree on every single thing on i agree with cosmos recieving a touch up and on the part boosting metas but not everything else 100
fix1 yes2 what exactly does boosting the meta level do3 dont care4 yes5 yesmoar cosmos1 a lot of work but would be welcome2 not sure3 screw drones nuke the drone regions please4 there already are some pirate cosmos serpentis and bloods come to mind5 you will never prevent players from creating guides6 might be asking for a lot here7 absolutely notwhat i really want to see remove the 1 time only limit i think this should be changed to 3 6 or even 12 months
1  yesminmatar and gallente have too many agents that dont give faction standing increase they need to be changed to one time mission offer with faction increase2  yesright now only a few storyline modules are equal to or a bit better than t2 modules most are equal to meta lv 3 they should all be equal to or better than t23  noamount of runs can stay the same more variety of different bpcs is needed instead of getting the same bpc 4 to 6 times4  yesalso the area where the skill books drop needs to be more random once a player finds out where they drop they farm it and make bank5  yesas it is most of the cosmos rewards are under par compared to regular agentsmoar cosmos1  notheres already plenty in high sec2  yesthis is definitely a must just to keep things balanced3  yesi like the idea but it should be limited to 2 constellations have the drone mind cosmos agent refer players to it after completing its mission4  yesjust to keep balance the pirate cosmos constellations should only have half as many agents as the main factions5  yesinstead of having super high standings to access players need to first complete all the missions for all the cosmos agents within that faction 6  noone for each faction is enough dont need to put even more stress on the server 7  yeslol this is a great idea make it only available to players doing cosmos mission agent x offers players mission to find his friend lost in a recurring wsystem in a certain area the agent inside offers a 3 or 4part mission with the last mission to find a way out the entranceexit would open and close at random times players could end up being stuck in it for days most cosmos missions are already way tougher than regular missions some are great to call on friends or corp mates to help complete it when needed but since faction standings arent shared i think they should still be more of a solo optioni agree cosmos missions are fun with a great story to them i have currently completed all level 3 and lower cosmos agents for all the empire factions and i plan on completing all the level 4 cosmos agents in the near futurethe storyline modules definitely need a boost after looking over my answers it seems i agree with 34s of the op so i give this thread a thumbs up
fantastic input demichael also i am aware that there is alot in this proposal i am not asking that all of this be implemented or at least not all of it in one go i am pretty passionate about cosmos and its potential contentwise just trying to start dialog so if you would like to see cosmos paid attention to in any way give it the thumbs up
well i do and since ive supported my argument with numbers and youve just blustered i wonder who has more credibility at the momentso would i but it wont happen until lst cpu use is fixed or rar pg use is fixed by a 400 increase
now imagine that fleet where the ravens can fit lsts without filling their lows with coprocs then it suddenly wouldnt be viable anymorehow can the impossibility to fit lsts on almost all battleships without requiring coprocs not be detrimental to the possibility of fitting a shield rr gang give them all 8 mids and they will still lack the cpu your argument just doesnt make any sense armor rr got more mids to play with shield rr should get more lows but has to use them on coprocs fix that and they can do more damage than armor rr gangs so got their role
reading this thread has increased my respect for sokratesz rather dramatically sensible observations and conclusions good presentation and comendable patience in the face of the stubborn opposition
erm no it would work just fine under current game mechanics because with ample logistics backup the battleships dont need to fit rr mods the only reason people havent tried it before is probably that they are stuck in the old doctrine of armour  superiornow we may have hit upon a totally unrelated issue heremaybe rr armour mods on bs are too easy to fit what if rr mods were meant to be difficult to fit on anything but logistics what if the proliferation of rr armour gangs without logistics is not working as intended 
lowering the cpu need will bring both raven and the scrop to the bs line and value assets to fleetsthey have base two free high slots free to use for that kind of purposesi can inmagen a rr fleet get warped by 10 rs torp ravens and 2 scrops if i had faced that i would have bailed
i loledi cant see a reason why you are not comparing the xlarge shield booster to the larxlsb 550 mw  230 tflar 2300 mw  55 tfthere is even a cross symmetry there factor of 10slst 192 mw  154 tflrar 660 mw  48 tfthe symmetry is not perfect factors are 4 and 428 but still quite obvious note that im using these numbers to show that both modules belong in the same class not that they are fine as isobviously your observation is wrong because your assumption was equivocal the fitting requirements decreasei agree with this analysis note that you should use an apoc instead of a mega for comparison as ravenapoc are the extremes in regards to cpupgi am not generally against the rebalancing of rr modules but this proposal is sloppy the premise that lst fitting requirements are the reason you dont see many shield rr fleets the flawed analysis and imprecise change request the discrepancy i would definitely like to see changed is to bring the cap use of both in line then maybe lower the cpu requirements of lsts a bitill consider supporting the proposal if you improve it and after youve done some more research on why shield rr setups or caldari ships for that matter arent used that much oh and its not like shield buffer hacs  shield logi support were being used effectively before the fotm armor hacs came up right
me clapsthis issue is extremely relevant i have outlined that in my very first post in fact i have outlined two possible solution and making armor rr harder to fit was one of them i am very glad that in the end we came to the same conclusion even if it took that long it had an absolutely opposite effect on me as i have seen him flipping sides answers and opinions just to preserve his face which he has not done very well and engaging in a large number of unreasonable attacks on various members of the community and ive told you times and times again that for you to prove my proposal inadequate i demand your words to be backed up by apropriate numbers which time and time again you have failed to provide moreover grater half of you argument is an irrelevant side discussion regarding logistics ships midslots and whatnot those things have little if anything to do with the topic of the proposal i would like to see strong evidence if you are to call my words rubbish i dont know wtf you are talking about simply does not cut it by now i highly doubt there is any aineko i dont think we should be comparing xlarge shield boosters because they have the boosting power and capacitor drain about double that or a large armor repairer so i think that comparison is not appropriatethe symmetry you show looks convincing but it is not seen in the fitting capabilities of armor tanking and shield tanking ships and so is a weak reason raven does not have 4x more cpu then an apoc to compensate for this fitting symmetry and to let it fit modules that require 4x more cpu percentage comparison done by gypsio iii is far more appropriate in my opinion
the higher repping power and cap usage of shield systems has always been a defining characteristic its even been mentioned ad nausea by at commentators what doesnt help is that shield boosters have 4 sizes in the same space where armor has only 3 s to xl vs s to l the naming of the 4 shield transporters sizes is imo more fitting micro to l and should also have been used for boostersofc not not all modules show extreme bias towards pg or cpu one could easily argue that the percentages are irrelevant as long as you can still make good fits regardless or rather youd have to prove that fitting a lst to a certain ship has in general as in not cherrypicking a case thats supportive of your stance more negative impact on the setup possibilities than fitting a lrar to a comparable shipalso you still dont acknowledge that there are other reasons for the popularity or lack thereof of shield rr fleets
actually the numbers to prove how wrong you are and how little you understand the game in which you play have been provided time and time againalso sok hasnt changed sides or answers anywhere in the thread time and time again hes telling you your wrong and time and time again you argue so afaik thats a pretty stable stance not flip floppywhat is actually happening is that you are selectively picking and choosing points in the thread to argue against and ignoring anything that flies directly in the face of your position in essence you are not arguing but going lalalalalalalalalalallalaimalwaysrightlalalalalallaa so nobody really cares anymoreyou simply dont understand pvp or ship fitting and theres nothing but time and hope that can fix thattldr your still dumb and fitting has little if nothing to do with the lack of shield rr gangs in eve
i dont really understand why a need is felt for shields to be on the same footing as armour or vise versa they are different aspects of a ships health but they are different and should have different causes and effects and requirements can some one point out where he explained why shields and armour should be treated in a similar manner he claims to have done so but i cant find it and given that its an assumed premise upon which his whole proposal rests on i would think it would feature more predominantly in this thread you know rather then being completely nonexistentalso please dont confuse how with why it baffles me that anyone could confuse the two in the first place but it seems to occur frequently enough
total support its not fair to ignore your current player base at the expense of expansion that most pvper and i dare say a fair few bears as well dont even care about we want a pvpstability fix
just wanted to say that the rework on level 4 and level 5 agents sending pve players into low sec systems should be considered an upgrade for pvp players
lets take a look at what they actualy saidonce incarna and dust are fully implemented focus will probably shift far more towards improvementfully implemented basicly they can keep claiming its still not fully implemented as long as they wantprobably thats right its not even a sure thing more of a maybeand at last far more well if you do jack  about it now doubling your efforts is far more but still crap d
me 3 ccpnoone griefs better than ccpi love this gametamber
i very much appreciate this the consistant approval of this proposal by the vast majority of people posting here suggests to me that drone options are sorely wanted even if not in this particular iterationif you do decide to bring it up please contact me ingame and i will put together a short presentation for you outlining what id like done primarily the contents of this post but also other additional options prefer size prefer velocity prefer nearest etc my thanks again and thanks to all for the ongoing support
ehm this is  just do it yourself dont be so ing lazy hows this helping anyonejust bind the drone attack button and use it i dont get this it wont work in a bilion yearseven if this stupid idea will ever get implemented itll only add more lag and youll be better off assigning drones manualy anyway since it doesnt take any time to press a combination of two buttons and no ai is going to be betterreally people who thumbs up this never heard of key bindings are seriously lazy and for them playing the game means staring at the screen or they just want annother buggy feature to complain about because i can tell you right now it wont work as you see it in your little head even if it did it wouldnt replace binding drone attack everedit think really really hard in your little brain how many lines of code youd have to add to drones ai and multiply that by about 2000 which is very generous for a fleet fightif drones need any help itd be faster reaction times and a working focus fire optionsorry this one time ill call anyone who supports this an idiot because this is pretty much saying ccp please control the drones for me i dont want to actually play the game by myself
i agree that we need new ships hull and while new tier ships do that i want criminal factions to get the combat class ships they dont havethat is destroyers battelcruiserscarriersdreadnoughtssupercarriers and titans after all these ship classes have been ingame without criminal faction models for a long time its time they go criminal

meh not supported in its current form i dont think it would be usefulhowever a scaled small medium large version with 10km range which pulled all ships and such would be fun larger the ship less the pull would be another interesting use antifrigate work
how could you generate a gravity well that only effects specific structuresobjects gravity acts on mass and ships have mass the same as cans and wrecks that used to be ships the proposed module would break the science part of scifihowever a gravity module that effects everything within range and uses the mass of the objects effected to create the actual effect would be sweet you could use one on an interceptor to help you orbit a large target faster and closer than you otherwise could the larger target could launch a jet can or drones which would get into the field and may actually slow you down or throw you out of orbit or a larger target could use one combined with a web to pull a smaller target in perhaps you could script it to be antigravity for a push effect as well this would allow a battleship to push drones out of optimal or a small ship to bounce out of the range of that blaster boat that just landed on top of itthat would be a cool moduleyou could presumably use the same code to alter the effects of the original tractor beam as well making it mass based and allowing it to be used on anything instead of bouncing you could tractor people off of station if you had the mass to do it of course if a cruiser tried to tractor a carrier the cruiser would be pulled into the carrieryou would also have to make the effect elastic and it would require ship thrust to be used and carefully im not a physicist so i dont know the right words to use but for instance the beam could produce a force that will apply a force of max strength of 5000lb figurative at a max range of 10km if ship a using the beam is stationary and target a is stationary and they are of the same mass the beam would pull the two together accelerating both toward each other at a rate corresponding to the relationship of the beam strength and total mass of the pull if the objects are of differing masses the smaller of the two would move toward the larger at a proportionately faster rate than the larger would move toward the smallerif one or both ships applied thrust in one direction or another it would effect the mass calculations of the ships and if enough thrust is applied in opposite directions to exceed the strength of beam the ships would move away from each other at reduced speeds until the range of the beam was exceeded and both were released from its holdhaving this in game would be good for when they eventually get around to being able to target and destroy specific system on a target ship you may need to tow your buddy back to station because even though his engines were disabled he managed to win that fight he was inbut its not going to happen your idea breaks immersion in the science element and mine would require way too much programming and cpu to accomplish on eve could you imagine someone lighting up the gravity well in the middle of a fleet fight blob grabbing several hundred ships potentially worse than that every ship in the blob lighting one up ohh especially the antigravity version  it would be sweet to see but the effects would be intensive on clients and servers alike
how about it being a net which will hold wrecks and cans placed into it with a tractor beam as long as the net is active the wrecks and cans wouldnt expire that would also help make salvaging faster be being able to free up the tractor beam to bring other wrecks and cans into the net which is being pulled along behind the ship
in homeworld 2 a gravity well generator prevented capital ships from jumping in within its active range  now that is a mod i could approve of
its a simple problem with a simple solution it is not quite accurate when you have an enemy locked on and your attacking or repping them and you can see a vague bar indicating how much shieldarmorhull they have i propose that we simply have a percentage of how much damage is done so say and just to keep it simple that your target has 800 out of 1000 armor left so when you hover over their lock on icon it will tell you the percents much like it does when you hover over your own having it set as just percentages will not change the gameplay a tremendous deal but will provide a bit more accurate reading my friends and i thought of this as we were sieging a tower and couldnt figure out how much it had left so like i said simple problem and simple solution especially as they already implement this in our own ships functions343guilty1
agreed especially for pos bashing during pos bashing theres a lot of are we there yet how much longer and you reply half a cheeto
seems to me that there shouldnt be a readout at all of how much health your target has you should have to tell via graphics on the target its self knowing exactly or even relatively how much armor or hull hps the target has isnt a realistic idea anyhow the only way you would know is by seeing chunks blown off in the case of armor or maybe the glow of the shield getting dimmer but shields dont glow in eve unless they are actively hardened or repping so why not get rid of the target hp readout all together it would make pvp so much more risky stressful and funmaybe we could even talk ccp into adding some kind of visual effect on the ship to indicate relative status like increasing amounts of blue sparks as the shields come down visual blackening denting and blowing off of armor plates most ships have what appear to be primary armor plates anyhow and we already have the increasing burning effect as hull goes downthis idea will never happen but i certainly dont thing there is any need or justification for having more detail on the little bars below your targets
lol the exact opposite of the direction i had intended but ccp cant and wont do graphics like that because it would cause a stupid amount of lag moreso than there already is and its a game not real life so we have sensors to detect their health
why bother when anyone with atleast 2 brain cells can do the same thing without all the fandangled paperwork
great idea but you must also understand that the isostandards are not a magic portal to awesomeness here is whythe isostandard stickers are just there because everyone has that pile of maps getting dust in their cabinets nothing more to see there been in a quite few corporations which have so oheverwonderfulfixeseverything isostandards and gotta say while they work in some levels they usually add pain and misery to some more creative in this case probably would be game design  implementation areas of workand even those would be there it doesnt help if people do not commit to follow blindly those standards which ofcourse are made by a person who wanted some profit for oneselfalso been in one project leadmanagement and logistics standardization process a long long time ago which gotta say was pretty neat and would have worked if the marketing  sales department would have adopted it first pretty much went down hill when the tech side adopted it and then the sales started calling us with pretty imaginative words for not accepting some random paper as a project and oh lord stay the heck away from itil if you want working itenvironment that actually works itil prolly works when you got itnetwork around 20 countries with 20 000 workers who do have some clue what to do but in the end the management failsinstead of itil hire a few bored itartists dbnetworksystem and appreciate their works of art not by money well dependant of the person but imagine that if everything works smoothly some extra free time and be open for ideas instead of asking your friends rightoutofschoolmba freshman how the awesomeness in the it work and then forcing people who actually knows the stuff to be a mindless slave and then blame on them for the managements bad choices and what comes to 27001 well it describes nicely what could be done however you need to do compromises as people are not robots  they need food drink and cigarettes  some are bold enough to demand love and affection in the way or otherwise youd be employing 1 actual worker and rest of the people in the company would be security guards and then only thing you hear here is every step you take every move you make ill be watching you if going by the standard as you cannot trust anyone probably should lock the corporations board of management in the cellar too as they might have too much power at their disposalwhat comes to network security there are some much flexible ways to implement the best practices in itsecurity by allocating services across your network while applying nice and thight security policies in the access which does not hinder the actual work where some have fallen into the darkest pit where anything youd need to do actual work is either denied classified or both which is in my opinion pretty dumbmore bureaucracy you bring into work well take a good look at goverment offices sounds neato huh
trust me i do know that i work in a fortune 500 company with 250k employees i can see the standards failing and also failing to fix what many people would expect them to every single day yes that is what happens if you hire a bunch of dumbos iso standards dont guarantee any form of quality in the output as we probably both know in my experience itil only starts to fail and it fails hard if this happens when people are employed that have no formal itil training and arent given any either due to cost savings but are expected to work within the standard this mostly applies to helpservice desk and 1st2nd line employees i agree rightoutofschoolmba freshmen are the worst but luckily that doesnt seem to be the case with ccp otherwise wed see a lot more paidfor services already also considering the fact that eve runs one of the biggest clusters on this planet if the it experts massively disagree their leverage is too high for them to be forced to do anything they cant be replaced because if you try the cluster goes down before you have a suitable replacement now as a counter example if ccp would be using something even close to itil theyd probably have tracked down a few more causes for the lag by now i think anyone who works in it knows that there cant be a single cause for the lag by now by iterating over recent rfcs and monitoringincident trends of course ccp most definitely already has a solid monitoring infrastructure by now otherwise the size of their cluster would be impossible to maintanewell i cant disagree there but it gives you a good guideline at least cont
trust me i know that feeling recently at work i had to get 3 separate approvals for 3 different things to be allowed to connect to a server but i do not believe this would happen with ccp as they dont have enough people for it to be worth it to implement such drastic measures however the threat of such overbureaucracy does not warrant not trying to be as secure as is reasonably possible i am painfully aware of parkinsons law no need to tell me i can of course see how all of this could very much go very wrong so your criticism is excellent in regards to pointing that out thank you
this standardization isnt the issue an active neglect for spending effort on fixing the problems with the game is iso1234567890001 wont fix that
current situation notifications are generated automatically and every player gets all notifications they could possibly get with no option to turn them off proposed change add a settings window for notifications somewherein mail settings its own window whatever where we can choose which notifications we get and have the others not how up at all perhaps add a daily digest modesimilar to most discussion groups as a third option for people who want to see the notifications but not get spammed incessantly one additional point would be nice to work in at the same time fuelmails should get an x hours remaining stat added and there should be individual checkboxes for each hour that way if i want to get mails hourly i can but if i want to drop it to say 24h and 6h only to lower spam i can do that tooobviously this should have toggle all functionality for easy switching benefits less clutter and trash in the ui window especially for directors of larger corporations god forbid they may even be able to use their mailbox properly drawbacks nil

you want to do whatas hes one of the few people i respect ingame ill support it without readingtamber
supported
i certainly support but do you think ccp has the resources to do such a thing
snarky answer of course they do in 18 months assuming nothing shiny comes into their field of view between now than then serious answer ccp has just said that all the major slots in expansions are filled it said nothing about minor stuff being full and this is pretty clearly in the realm of minor stuff if they wanted to this could be put in pretty quickly and every major patch has perhaps half a dozen fixes this size i doubt that this is at the top of the priority list but yes they have the resources to do it pretty easily assuming no unforeseen technical bs
oh hell yes
bump to save from a lock
thanks for bumping or i wouldnt have seen this awesome proposal supported
right now there is an alarm for your hit points on your ship what is also needed is an alarm that would go off depending on standings for local channel this of course can be customized to your likingit would add more imersion to the game because it would be like in star trek when the clingons get nearbwaahhhhrp red alertwe have advanced spaceships and not having this feature is like having a top of the line pc but having a dot matrix printer hooked up to ittime to upgrade the printer ccp

when you pin a window in the ui you have to go into general settings and check the lock windows when pinned option to get them to actually not move i think it would also be a good idea just to have a simple dialogue box appear when you pin a ui option with the option to disable it from appearing againi know you guys in the csm already covered ui changes in general last meeting but maybe you could fold this into the portfolio of changes you planned to make its silly to enable pinning without giving the user the idea of how to accomplish its purpose not getting windows to collapse or move
every time i log in my chat stacks reset themselves to some stupid order that i dont want and i usually leave them pinned and what i really enjoy is when i try to unpin them and drag the windows in the stack into their proper order but whatever i drag out seems to think its still pinned so it wont restackso i strongly support getting fixes within the next 2 years derp
i like your idea and would like to add a few of mine to refine it some first off ccp should remove the current learning skills in game and refund any skill points spent training them you attributes however should stay the same so if you trained 44 or 55 or whatever you still have the same attributes if you are a vet that already trained the skills then this proposal wont affect you if you are in the midst of training the skills however this will help you out a lotthe next thing that needs done is for ccp to add 6 new skills to the game dealing with learning these however cant be directly trained like normal skills they would gain points simultaneously as you train other skills one skill for each attribute and one skill for learning each skill would grant a 2 bonus to its attribute per level so the benefit is the same now as you train a skill in game you earn sps in that skill plus you will earn the same amount of sps in the corresponding primary and secondary attributes i would make these new learning skills have a high enough rank so it takes about the same amount of sps to get them to level 5 as it does now to get 1 attribute basic and advanced to level 5so for example you are training engineering to level 5 and are earning 1500 sphr at the same time you will get 1000 sphr in intelligence learning and 500 sphr in memory learning numbers are made up just to illustrate the example i feel that this system will limit minmax gameplay somewhat in that you get no real benefit to training all intmem skills in a row or bouncing between skills you reach the same attributes after the same amount of skill points anywayedit im not sure how the skill that gives 10 boost overall aka learning should work how should you get sps for that skill
addressed this in the post right above yours will edit the opex velocity makes rockets broken the other issues just make them underpowered
excellent idea ive been wanting to use my vengeance assault ship its too shiny to be so useless
with all due respect this is a naive statement it shows at the very least that you havent made any attempt to understand the missile formula or read the correct rocket explosion speed thread in the test server feedback forumthe biggest problem is drf damage reduction factor its a constant in the missile formula which determines how steeply damage is reduced by the velocity of the target thankfully ccp seem to understand that simply increasing the ev explosion velocity would be a bad ideaonce ccp get round to fixing rockets they wont touch them again for a long time so the fix needs to be right first time to bring rockets in line with torps youd be looking at something like thisdrf  15ev  100er  20damage   65clip size  200note that the most significant changes are to the drf damage and clip size the base ev only needs a small increase in this scenariofixing rockets is not as simple as giving a 100 increase in ev which would leave us with poor damage and wed still need a web to hit ab jaguars let alone ceptors or dramiels the issue has been discussed to death for the last 18 months we know what needs changed and are just waiting for ccp to pull their finger out and do it
this topic was passed by the csm over a year ago the most recent word from ccp is this quote from the correct rocket explosion speed thread in the test server feedback forumif you wish to support this topic please do so in the existing thread that was passed by the csmits nice to see this enthusiasm for fixing rockets but lets keep to a single thread rather than having many small threads scattered about the place
i number of variations of this proposal have been suggested by other players in various other threads my major reason for posting this is that while i agree learning skills need to be addressed i dont agree that everyone should just be awarded 10 points in each attribute and a 10 skill bonusproposalreplace learning skills with a sort of attribute acquisition system players then gain additional attributes based on how many skillpoints they have trained in a given attribute a skills primary attribute would be used in determining which attribute to increase secondary attributes of skills could also increase as long as its twice as slow as the primary one though i dont really care if they are each attribute would cap at 10 the bonus from the learning skill itself could be acquired at an even slower rate than the attributes from simply training any skill the exact point at which additional attribute points would be awarded couldand should be adjusted to scale with the approximate payoff times of the current learning skills this obviously involves a lot of number crunchingimplementation of this proposal would fix the pointless tedium that is learning skills without giving newer players the same attributes as veterans it would also prevent the massive buff to alt training times which would occur if every character were simply given attributescybernetics would stay the sameremaps would stay the samethe noob training bonus would stay the sameall skillpoints for trained learning skills would be redistributed in the same way they were a few weeks agowhy its necessarywhile training learning skills isnt technically necessary to play the game its necessary for anyone wishing to have competitive and efficient training times a player who gets a 444 setup in the attributes of the skills hes training will shave days off the same plan that a player who doesnt train the learning skills will a person who trains learning skills is literally able to train more skills to level 5 over the course of a year than someone who doesnt
looks like a halfassed ninjaed version of learning skills replaced with focused trainingit may be my fault but i couldnt exactly understand what you mean you want to revamp the attributes system too oo
breaking news eve is broken apparently polish is too much to ask for start canceling your accounts because thats the only feedback they listen to
according to ccp zuluparks dev blog ccp are including incarna teams when talking about the number of devs working on eve thus if incarna is eve then the csm would in theory have the same input as they do with flying in space ill leave that open for a joke about the csm having no real input 
well the influence of the csm seems to be quite limited better than no influence at all though and i apreciate the hours you guys put in
is the csm still here
kk good speed at working within and outside ccp you folks have been doing fine work im sure you will let us know when we can be of help delilah
my favorite part was where vul kept good on his promise to the community and really let ccp have it about that lag cluster  where super caps were spawned back after they jumped outthe right decision was madebrofist
thanks for doing such a great job representing our point of view to the developers and owners of the company they seem to be focused on other things right now but i still have hope that there heart is in the right place
being in the business i tend to cut ccp a bit more slack than i think the average customer would but that was my impression as well from the outside they appear to simply be doing waterfall with different meeting and reporting requirementscould we have small change x nothe right answer is to completely rewrite it and that would take too long thats a pretty classic antipattern that you dont typically see from shops that have internalized agilei am not in the gaming industry but i am a saas veteran and it seems to me that ccp would benefit from smaller more frequent releases among other agile principlesi suspect part of the problem is economics they get huge bumps on expansion releases and relatively good retention numbers despite the bugs eve is a great productthis is all speculation on my part of course our csm delegates could probably comment with more authority having actually met and interacted with several of the principals
edit posting fail
ccp used to do waterfalland yes wed rather overhaul the entire thing rather than make these changes is a pretty common response by ccp to csm issues for broken stuff such as poses and evemaili am not really a management sort of person and dont really know all that fancy lingo but those are my observations also i think that overhauling response could be due to the original writers of the system leaving ccp and everyone else being afraid to touch their code its no secret that their pay isnt the best and i wouldnt be surprised if their more talented programmers get headhunted
ankhesentapemkah should have been removed from the csm and finnagain zero should be removed from the forums

ill throw in a commemorative spoon too perhaps we can get sokratesz finnagain and ank to sign them delilah
this needs to be removed as she has been booted in disgrace it is unfair to the good honest and mature members of the csm that she share this badge of honour with decent folk
posting to confirm that this had better be dealt with
i really really dont care has she even posted since the whole thing went downeither way though the bookkeeping should probably be done
it would be good to see this handled it may provide closure for those afflicted by the issue delilah
sniff ever since ankh disappeared i just cant sleep at night without knowing what happened to her

oh lol not my intention
pUFFFDtur is on vacation at the moment i assume it among other pressing matters will be dealt with on his return this week
other pressing matters such as my ingame csm medali will gladly take the forum badge from her as i am less disgraced and more honorable monocle
i freakin lUFFFDUFFFDve monocles
id do an asian chick with a monocle
fantastic job folks keep moving forward if ccp wants democratic input keep giving it to them if not then they need to get honest and end this
worked on then i completely understand your view on it an thats a shamethis raised my curiosity  which features pray tell might those bethxifly
do isd still exist this sounds like a job for one of them to do some research and produce a listthere are a lot of fixes suggested by the csm but its a big pain to research all the items and see if they made it ingame so i dont have one right now one off the top of my head i remember is they added the showinfo button when people convo you and they also removed term limits woohoo
too funny  missionrunners being abused for daring to want to contribute to a thread related to improving lowsecoh the irony even funnier the number of lowsec dwellers who will read this and not understand what im refering to
breaking news eve is broken apparently polish is too much to ask for start canceling your accounts because thats the only feedback they listen to
lets assume ccp set up a cluster with one blade or one cpu core dedicated to a single system it is not a good approach for the highly uneven load distribution in evea it would be a waste of resources as most systems have little loadb it would not solve the problem of the performance ceiling on the highly loaded nodesyou might have noted that nowadays cpus improve in the number of cores not so much the speed of a single core for eve thats unfortunate as it cant use multiple cores the code is not multithreaded the tasklets they use are good for dealing with asynchronous requests but not equivalent to os threadsto distribute load among multiple cores or even servers you need to first break down the load into smaller chunks of work ideally those chunks would be independent from each other so you dont have the issues issler mentioned but game code is typically highly branchy and interactive on multiprocessor systems those dependencies can be bad enough keywords locking bandwidth cache coherency which is one of the reasons smp systems usually do not scale linearly in performance if you distribute the load among multiple systems you additionally have to deal with latency which can break your neck data that can be accesses in nanoseconds locally takes milliseconds over the network with thousands of accesses per second this quickly becomes a problemprevious dev blogs on the cluster stated that the db and storage backend are handling the load just fine and are not bottlenecks during fleet fightsindeed ccp burdened themselves with that issue when they designed eve the way it is i do believe it was naive but in that context the fact that the subscriber count did not explode extremely fast is a blessing for ccp
while there are a ton of ideas people would love to have this is my wish list and i am sure a lot of pos managers would agreesource
agreedalso though im sure this is getting buried in this threadnaught if ccp wants to give us something shiny and new why not crank out the faction battlecruisers the models already exist in many cases the skins already exist it wouldnt be difficult to make fleet issues of the prophecy ferox brutix and cyclone and pirate faction ships of the harbinger drake myrmidon and hurricane racial bonuses have pretty much become standardized across the board so really the hardest part would be deciding where to put those extra slotsif ccp wants to give us two updates a year only one should focus on game play changes the other can tweak existing mechanics and add fun stuff like this for the players
i would rather fly a well maintained ship into in combat then have my guns jam when it really counts

yes ccp we  or or or or  some of us have even gotten to 
i completely agree youll get more subscribers by fixing whats broken rather than introducing exciting new features that only keep us entertained for a few weeks

i subscribe to fix fw as soon as possible but dont waste effort that was put into incarna for that incarna is important and has priority and people are waiting for that much too long now this gets a bunch of new players a bunch of new targets profit and new tacklers for the own fleet eve really needs this even if you are not in rpbut fw is seriously broken fix it please i subscribe for this but dont do it with a hot needle id appreciate a serious overhaul of that stuff take your time but do it pleaseUFFFD  with cherry on top
ccp always create a fanfare of this big new features but as always they turn out to be half finished useless additions that just get left bascially ccp think by adding a small item it satisfies the player base and thats all they need to dopeople go on about but its a free upgrade yeah but its a useless upgrade i would much rather pay for a very good upgrade than have a useless one
i havent played any fw since just after it came out back then it was all new and exciting but quickly got uninteresting and i left to pursue some 00 pvp instead as such i havent really followed up on how it works today but everyone here keep on saying saying fix the bugs would someone care to enumerate what exactly is wrong with fw beyond simply being boringaj
how much resources can a bone or two costlike lp for fw killssupported
supportedfw is by far one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game for me and i would love to see some extra pvpcentric added or at the very least a cleanup of certain longstanding quirks
ive been in this game nearly 2 years i jumped into fw after just a few months and found it to be great fun and far too broken so i left to try other thingssince then some things have been improved combat lag lpmissionsisksink etc but as a whole still not enough to be called fixed other things are still as broken as when it all started plexing lack of consequences of system occupancy alliances etcive been other places in the last year but fw feels like where i should be shame to find it still the wooden hut i ran away from so long agofw is 2 years old and still needs to be fixed equally wis has been on the way just as long ccp you need to hurry up and finish the stuff that is live before you deploy the stuff thats comingps that bit of propaganda you did regarding the domainance in the calgal zone ages ago get real that situation was a result of the monumental fw problems not it working as intended
supportedremove learning skills ccpits one thing to make a mistake in adding these stupid skills to the game its quite another matter to have let that mistake stand for so many years even when you acknowledge theyre a mistake still better late than never
kinda making me said  but also happy  we will have lot of fun with the noobs
cmon ccp your fw players have had to htfu so how about about you start showing us some excellence hmm

supporting this is one of most user hostile color and illumination schemes one could think off
this 1 though im not sure that the limitations on cargo holds are needed one one hand access to extra ammo and cap charges may be considered bad but on the other hand it would be pain if the aggression was caused by rats whilst miningpresumably the restrictions would include not allowing swapping of modules with those in your own cargo hold
as i was reading the op i kept thinking to myself lofty redux i see how there may be a need to address this issue but be careful the cure is not more deadly than the disease
100 agree

going through the assembly hall supporting awesome ideas
shield and armor are different but different doesnt mean one should be impossible to fit why not make extenders and plates different by increasing pg of plates by factor 10 then they are also different makes you more happyi guess you also think rockets should be nerfed since they need to be different yes that is pretty much what sok is doing he has given a total of one serious argument and besides that it has been just troll arguments trolling and screaming lalalalalla and that serious argument has been explained why it is a problem but not the end reason why you couldnt do a shield rr bs gang even if you would give them all 8 mids you still cant do a shield rr bs gang since barely any ship can fit lsts without coprocs explain me sok just said that a raven  some other gang could be extremely powerful at the same time he also claims a shield rr gang cant work so now imagine that same raven  some other gang but with lsts that can be fitted on ravens without coprocs then you still got that powerful gang but now they can spider tank how would that suddenly become a weaker gang for fitting lsts
probably gets ignored again by the lalalalllalalal crowd but an attempt anywaythe argument is that shield transporters with reasonable fitting reqs would still be useless due to lack of mids rightso what do we have for rrrequired low dciirequired mids mwdheavy med cap boosteri think we can agree that required for shield tank are dual invuln  lse sure a second lse would be nice but cant have everything and i think we can also agree the lack of second lse doesnt make it a useless principleso that fills the mids of our 5 mid bsnext normal fitting for rr bs is the sensor booster i will take the tempest and hyperion here for comparison both 5 mids but hype has larger sig radiusshield version for both gets lse  3 shield rigs with shield rigging 3 i think that is a nice average with 4 it would be bit better for armor but honestly differences are small armor version gets a sensor boosternow the self lock time of the pests is 7 seconds for shield and 47s for armor the hyperion is 58 and 38 so what we have is 23s slower lock for reps in the tempest case and 2 seconds slower for the hyperion is a bit over 2 seconds really a reason why it would fail can you seriously say thatyes you say okay then armor rr should be useless in general meta 4 or for armor even 3 is uses for rr modules they got a cycle time of 5 seconds 45 seconds for t2 shield reps in beginning of the cycle armor in the end the result shield rr groups without sensor booster will provide logistics 253 seconds earlier than a comparable gang of armor rr shipsyes it also means enemies are locked slower still it is indeed a difference but again can you really say that it is that significant if you really think it is a problem dont fit that mid slots sebo but a low slot sig amp then you are still slower locker but got more targetting range can be handy when being damped not that much though and more important you got another 2 locked targets that should easily compensate for slower lockingalso remember having a high scan resolution so you can get quickly reps on your friend is important when you do 40 vs 40 but if you got 4 bs  2 tacklers and are roaming through low sec you can just prelock all your friendlies anyway and most likely also all opponents so here the lower scan resolution is really completely irrelevantso the next point eccm these days amount of ecm is not nearly as much as it used to be still indeed it exists and mid slot eccm give more sensor strength and can be overloaded cant deny here that it is a potential problem luckily there just isnt that much ecm around anymoreoffensive ewar then minus tackling gear pretty much never used on rr bs so skippedthen tackling simple solution 1 take some hictors with you they should keep some  tackled and can be repped when they drop their bubble solution 2 not all bs will have 5 mids maels ravens and rokhs have spare mids they can be fitted with points really not everyone needs a point in a rr bs so which problems do we have with mids the lack of eccm is there and no tackle only true on 5 mid bs and while definately doesnt make you happy panda you can work around it in return you get loads of low slots that you can uselets say you want to do some roaming through low sec with shield rr bs you get a couple of ravens they can all fit a point if you want but they cant possibly fit lsts without coprocs how would a rr raven gang some support hic huginn etc be useless
what would honestly be so bad about lowering the cpu req of the lst all it would mean is that ships fitted for rr shield gangs would get is an extra 100 dps as they would be able to fit that 3rd damage mod they may also be able to fit the t2 lst too which means better tanking abilityif the cpu lowering proposal were to happen rr shield gangs will still suffer from in general slightly lower buffer slightly lower sensor strength and the need to use cap transfers to manage their cap they will have one advantage over armour and that is dps a gang of 10 rr shield tempests will deal 1000 total more dps than a gang of 10 rr armour tempests the shield fits will also struggle to manage their cap especially when the armour pests can use the second utility high for a large neut
qft we get that this is what you believe now show us the numbers demonstrating the rationale behind this belief leave logistics aside leave midslot differences aside show us how the current cpu needs of a lst is not a limiting factor when compared to the fitting needs of a lrar
again sok were not talking about logistics cruisers the topic is rr mods on battleships this is not a totally unrelated issue nor is it one that has just been hit upon i brought it up in my first post in this thread i am happy with the fitting requirements of lrars and their tactical utility  they can be fit without fitting mods on bs and the distribution of rr ability among a fleet rather than being isolated within whatever logisticscarrier support adds diversity and tactical options i see no justification for the prohibitive cpu requirements of lsts the absence of shield rr bs gangs damages the diversity of the game making for predictable and onedimensional fits and tactics hac gangs are balanced and viable whether shieldtanked or armourtanked because their rr source logistics cruisers are balanced and i see no reason for the disparity on the bs scaleyou overstate the medslot problem i showed that what the five medslot bs lose on ehp is more than made for by far superior damage projection the effectiveness of received rr is similar the tackle issue can be handled by the sixmedslot bs and by nonecm scorpions eccm cannot be regarded as essential and the need for sensor boosters is mitigated by the delivery of shield at the start of the 45 s lst cycle the option of additional ewar such as damps or tds on armour bs can be counted against the much superior dpsatrange of shield bssure the armageddon apocalypse abaddon megathron and typhoon would be difficult to fit into a shield rr bs gang mwd large injector invuln invuln dc extender rigs still not impossible though a typical shield mega would have 35 less ehp but do 41 more turret dps with 67 better tracking at 20 km so what its no different to the difficulty of fitting up the maelstrom scorpion raven and rokh for armour tanks
sigh you dont get it do you shields are and should be different from armor the fact that you compare rr bs fleets only makes me think that you have absoloutely no idea about medsmall fleetswhile armor rr is best for large scale bs fleets being saved a gazilion times so far shield rr is great for medsmall fleets no armor tanked fleet can match the speed and agility of a schimitarcanemach nanofited fleet then again a strong dpswell armor tanked harbringerguardian fleetbut slow  or even a drakebasilisk fleet with a strong tank and that not huge but stable dps my point is different fittings and ships for different use and desired effect you want to make shield rr same as armor rr but then no variaty in pvp not as many overal uses simple as that btw changing modules fittings requirements will either k up all logi pilots including myself because now modules need more pgcpu or the shield rr now has lower pgcpu requirements and all scimitarbasilisk pilots get a huge boost by fitting better tank other modules they could not fit 
no you have this completely wrong the objective is for shields and armour not to be different it is for them to be different but balanced i suggest that you read up on armourhac gangs rr bs being armour only  no varietyits been said a million times that the logistics cruisers bonuses and fittings would be tweaked to maintain their balanced status quo
reduce the cpu cost of shield remote reps by 2030 of so i think that would make it more viable without breaking stuff obviously the logistics bonuses would need to be reduced to compensate for this so it remains the same across the board
how is only armor bs spider tanks variaty you got an interesting definition of variaty there most people would think that more viable but completely different fittings would be more variaty you apparently think that only a handful of possible fittings is variatyone thing is certain here you do not fly shield logistics cruisers if you did you would know there isnt any viable fitting where cpu is an issue so even though it has been mentioned hunderd times now that logistics cruisers simply could have there cpu lowered even if that didnt happen they wouldnt be boosted in any way since they dont lack cpu now it doesnt matter if you got 50 or 200 spare cpu if armor pg reqs would be increased than the bonus of the armor logi cruisers could simply be adapted so that is also a bs argument now i think about it if you would want to adapt shield logis for some reason just lower their cpu role bonus so they use exactly same amount of cpu on logis when the transporter usage is decreasedbut you are obviously part of the lalallalala crowd since we explained this several times now and every time you just flat out ignore it and a while later you come again with a post that it would make shield logis op and that more different possible fittings is bad for variaty
lalalah crowd is obviously not reading they brought up logi cruiser argument on the first pagethey still keep bringing it up on the 4th pagebecause a personal insult is the best way to win an argument
gets my vote but i do think that if ccp does expand it may be able to devote more resources to eve whether or not they would do this though is a completly different matter it may even be the final acid test
blizzard supports their product like nobody else in the industry while ccp maintains its not worth it to support theirs

not supportedsanctums are somewhat in line with level 4 missions maybe a bit harder and a bit more rewarding but thats just my personal opinion if you want something tougher scan for cosmic signatures and find yourself a nice 810 or 1010 plexi would vote for spawning more signatures instead of boosting anomalies but i dont have the economic statistics or any true insight of the amount of those plexes run every day ingame economy is delicate and any changes to isk flow should be very carefully implemented if theres need for those changes in the first place
i dont want any dungeons thank you very much
my personal opinion is that you shouldnt get your csm badge until youve had a proposal passed unanimously by the current csmso right now only ankh mynxee and myself are truly deserving of csm badges sok in particular needs to give his up asap
sorry giving out csm forum badges is not in the 18month plan once incarna and dust are out theyll consider looking in to the problem
guys this is the worst trolling also this is seriousi still dont have my ingame medal and im pretty upset about this how can you live without having medals i might have to resort to awarding myself a csm5 medal
supporting this and also would like to propose ccp award merit badges to those who manage to get themselves kicked out of the csm
only a question maz has been confirmed as a member of the csm or she is still a alternateif i look the official csm page i still see ankhesentapemkah as full member so if ankh removal has been finalized and the csm regulations assign the seat to the next one in voting order she should get the tag if ankh removal in not jet completed because she oppose the removal and she and ccp are still arguing about it or if the csm regulations dont consider a way to fill the vacant post with a new seated member and maz will stay an alternate she should not get the tag
i have been confirmed as a csm member ccp just forgot the icing on my cakebangs fist on table
confirming i am not an alt of tamber and i support this thread
i support this
i agree take away everything that she has and give it to me kthx
care to share the confirmation mailso far ccp hasnt communicated anything about your confirmation
also trapped fighters like a sheet of flypaper also dont we already have a cynojammer for that
not really cynojammer effects an entire system what soks version of the gravity well generator would do is prevent capitals from jumping into certain patches of spaceyou could for example activate the module to prevent your fleet from being hotdropped in a system that isnt cynojammed or prevent counter dropscapital support being jumped in if you had an enemy capital tackledshould also disrupt cynosural fields within its aoe so that you cant bridge into it

so erm we need more cap fights oh i like that
it strikes me odd that a player cannot own a pos that the pos is always owned by a corphow can one setup a proper pos if they flip corpsi believe there should be an option for a player to have full control over a pos
stop flipping corps so often that taking down and putting up a pos is getting bothersome
going through the assembly hall supporting awesome ideassomme players do have sufficient wealth and ongoing projects to warrant a pos managing corporationowned and playerowned towers is a pain i wont even talk about permissions and related stuff  there is no way to make a corp member able to manage his stuff without also giving him the rights to steal all the corps assets
this feature was scheduled for the implementation by ccp they even announced it in a dev blog before some expansion im not sure which exact expansion but i think it was dominion however the feature was lost in some black hole along with ab bonuses for assault ships and formal alliance treaties
i too would like some player owned player owned starbases
not supported when i started playing eve years ago i was in favor of something like this but no longer duals can happen using ag mechanics in highsec using can mechanics or war decs corp vs corp or even inside ones own corp because concord doesnt interfer with a corps internal affairs with propper trusted moderators bets can be placed prizes can be awarded so theres no really any need for this if you want to do it for free iskwise you just arrange a meet on the test server or just have a dont kill me rule way more likely to survive a civilized fight with a corpmate if youre just wanting to practice all in all plenty of options already id be more interested in incarnagames where wagers can be made on and against other players spectatorparticpation sports or games that dont involve spaceships because it would be something differentnew
ok we understand that there are many many threads about lack of ccps focus on delivering decent upgrades as of late or the lack of continual development and supporti do feel there is this its a free upgrade so stop whining attitude correct  but doesnt make it right tho does itthe problem is people actually like the additions but they are so weak and buggy and shallow that people almost crying out for them to be upgraded ccp seem to be more interested in bringing in more players rather than looking after their existing ones trouble is new players see the problems and leave we know there hasnt been a significant change in ppl online for a few years despite some of the big upgrades so im not longer ramblinglook im sure that alot of people would be happy to pay a one off payment for upgrades if they where substantial and supported fully and constantly developed the revenue could pay for a team to work on enhancing existing content and bug fixes its a little annoying as ccp must be make millions per month in subs but howeveri mean alot of mmos do it yes if ppl dont upgrade theres the different instance problem as they could no longer play and ccp still insist on having a single world which is fine and there may a point where ppl say im not paying for upgrades small i think but i think the benefits probably outweigh the risksthe problem will be if ccp dont commit to enhancing and fixing if we did pay for upgrades i dont want to talk about wow but blizzard have got it right they listen and they create some outstanding updates you cant deny that and this isnt about wow the games its about business intelligenceanyway these are my thoughts and ideas
i wouldnt mind dropping one subscription in order to pay for decent upgrades if there was any reason to believe ccp actually understood what is decent at this point they dont appear to get why were unsatisfied
supporting my own idea btw
i rather get ty upgrades free than pay for ty upgradesthere is no reason to assume that with more money we would get better expansions the vast majority of their devs dont work on eve now more money probably only increases the amount of dustwod devs
yeah you assume the quality deficiency comes from a lack of rl isk
while i would like more shiny stuff i have no illusions regarding how much work ccp is actually doing i personally would not like to pay for updates unless i was to see massive improvements in expansion quality it does not seem that money is the issue though as curretly ccp does not have any employees sitting around and are hiring which means they are willing to spend money which means they have money they need and i really like the concept of free expansions in a subscriptionbased game
not supported
fair enough guys just have to stop whining and put up with what you get thendont think there is much more to say
oooooh burn you really got us with your web of logic exceptno you didnt did you we all pretty much answered that until ccp demonstrates the ability and willingness to deliver good upgrades paying for said upgrades would be pointless try again
players would just use ventts all the time instead of some of the time a good comwarfare stratagy is possible already in the game just hit the primary and or other targets with endless private chat invites with the right timing those windows cascade his screen long enough for you to distractconfuse him allowing you to change tatics or we to ensure you get the kill im not saying it will work all the time or that its appropiate to every situation but it can be a good tatic against tanky station huggers or to active tankers when you are trying to close in nuet rangeetco crap i just got trolled by jason edwards noobs in belts dont have time to call for help lol

i wouldnt go for removal of health bars and i have no problems with being able to see percentages besides that ccps backlog is already full and then this is imo not a very high priorityhowever regardless of that i would be in favour of having a visual indication how your target is doing also should not be that hard to make stuff like sparks on a shield that increase if it becomes lower armor plates falling apart would be harder though but since it can be done purely client side and make it an option just like other effects it should not add any lag unless your comp sucks and you just turn it off
just as capsuleers have a combat record i think it would be fitting for ships to receive battle stars for ships they destroyit would add quite a bit of character to see a ship with a hundred kills the stars stencilled down its side proudly heradling its fallen enemiesthis could be read off a ships show info and would likely wipe if the ship is repackaged but thats reasonable
i would love to see something like this if a feature like this were possible i think a ships name should be unchangeable once its given and once it starts gathering battlestars i dont like that name but its what you called it other history items might also be cool to see for ships   systems visited or  days hours flown or  lightyears traveled etc give the ships some personality and uniqueness supported
theres not a hope in hell ccp could or would get iso9000 ive been there twice in companies and honestly its a pain in the rectum to comply with it its also very expensive to do and time consuming upon managers and staff however once youve got that compliance it opens doors that previously had been shut the ammount of money those two companies generated afterwards was astounding
as a rule good management will make good decisions sox and iso dont help with that  they just get in the way in a number of waysliang

i dont have a side pro or con on the banning issue i read the thread for the drama went to her website and noticed thison 19 september 2009 eva graduated at the utrecht school of the arts receiving her master of arts degree as graduation project eva developed a realistic 3d space shooter game featuring advanced physics for more information about this project visit the game design pagenow if i worked at eve and if eva had any access to eve code or nda protected info during her masters project red flags would fly for me enough for me to take a serious look at her projectjust saying seems like an important piece of info no one has brought up yet more interesting then who did what with a spoon
she stole dust and used it to get a masters degree calling it now

so weve got a shield warning armor warning and hull warning but when a curse rolls around it would be nice to have a capacitor warning toowhile were at it perhaps make it a bit easier to see when people are targeting you an additional filter for the overview settings could be added to include a pilot that has you locked this could even help you know if youve lost friendly rr support as youd see that your friendly has lost his lock even if youre playing without brackets zoomed out whateverlastly some slightly larger easier to read incoming ewar indicators would be nice okay i have miscellaneous affecting me but what is that although ensuring locking targets are on overview would help this even in its current small icon formtear it apart
on the whole good ideas
yeah good ideas especially the ones about locking but this thread is in the wrong forum perhaps a friendly neighborhood mod would move it to the assembly hall
sure i also proposed a drone aggro warning your drones getting damaged a while ago but people went meh why dont you start a thread in ah for more audio warning options so we can support it
i assume that ccp soundwave was referring to issues that have been done or are being worked on for inclusion in the winter expansion csm doesnt have a clue which ones those are i asked what those were later in that thread but there has been no response to my question either in the thread or privately draw your own conclusions from that
asking the eve community to draw their own conclusions based on limited information is like asking a dog to lick its own balls

mmmm how can a good idea get more visibility is the idea not as good as i think
wonderful idea i agree the tactical overlay needs some serious updating1
great idea you could additionally color code the line based on speed if you like with perhaps 35 possibilities  red above 3000 orange 23000 yellow 12000 blue 5001000 or black 0500or whatever just the idea of having rough speed communicated by color coding for instantaneous recognition recognizing line lengths where the line can be in any direction on a sphere would be difficult
as a programmer it makes my teeth grind when i see people blithely say this would be an easy fix whether the fix is easy or not i definitely support this idea
sounds like a good idea
opposite to this i would remove concorde from the game sorry
cmon ccp pi blows and you know it just look at the price of robotics now 1

100 supportedi will say though that i think ccps reasoning is that they want to get other features that they seem to have their hearts set on into eve and then work on what they perceive to be minor problems their style is that of an artistroughly sketch in the main parts of the drawing then after you get the whole layout you go back in for fine detail the problem with this particular philosophy is that we are interacting with and existing albeit virtually within this world there needs to be a much higher level of polish to be comfortably habitable by eves citizenspatrons
supported but ccp has pretty much proven the csm is irrelevant to their development process i fear that only if they start getting a lot of bad press or subscriptions drop substantially will they finally start to get it you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means
make this game great again
if it needs a radical change in the way ccp is planning their next 18 months then so be it i think the player base is fed up with halffinished expansions that never get touched after release ccp need to seriously consider allocating ongoing significant developer resources to finishing content to an excellent standardsupported
seriously
im really glad that this topic has been addressed full support here
the bugs and other issues need to be worked out of the existing game before ccp introduces new bugs    er content   
and put some actual resources into the current game why dont ya

i would also like this fixed since i scan on daily basis it is very irritating and a fix doesnt seem so hard
i just want to see what implants people really have p
look here
it seems the evelopedia forgot to mention the most important effect this will have in order to stroke that all important epeen people will start trying to get more pods than ships pods will often be worth more than the ships this shift from concern about killing ships to killing pods will hurt new players who need to have implants in order to try to get decent skills so new players should not only avoid pvp due to lack of skills but they will suffer larger economic loses in pvp than older players i think this is one of the many reasons why this proposal is voted down by the players in assembly hall  at least every time i saw it players rejected the idea it seems a csm who are mostly veteran players had a thread they thought supported this idea  although the evelopedia doesnt give a link
what is the game you are playingop supported this will give us better idea of the damage caused to the enemy another rifter down meh whatever but look the dude had 1 bil of pirate implants in his head
im playing eveand your response on this shows what i predict will likely occur you will find many many more pods killed with attribute implants than with pirate implants
supportedbut id just like to confirm that this change will not make me want to kill pods more than ships that argument is entirely incoherent you need to kill the ships to get the pods and why on earth wouldnt you want to kill pods regardless of implant disclosurekill them all
actually you can kill pods before all the enemy ships are killed right now you would be best served by killing all the enemy ships before you start switching to pods however if implants are shown its much more likely that you would try to target pods before you target the next ship
only result is more epeen  pirates dishonoring ransoms even more often  less victims go to low sec  pirates go whining for easier targets  not in the mood for that so againston similar note remove killmails

supportedalso at the general lack of reading comprehension in this thread
that is your opinion and easily made a spectacle of ghost was a complete failure never took off and soaked up a ridiculous amount of revenue that could have gone into other projectswow itself is mindbogglingly stale with the same models released years ago still being recycled and reskinned and many of the encounters little more than remixes or tiny revisions to old ones it succeeds in spite of itself their business practices are dubious scalping players for more money by selling cosmetic features like mounts or minor services like server changes for double what a month of playtime is worthccp is the very model of good game development ethics and while you will likely not find all of their work appealing what they are doing is excellent on a final note this incarna project everyone complains about as a waste of development is very much going to improve eve bring a fresh wave of players and raise the bar in the industry for character renderingthe lack of a human avatar is the most complained about feature for eve by potential players its in every other review by game journalists interested in what this game is about if that is any indication of the impact that this feature will have to new or potential players this will cause an explosion of growth in the game most of whom will increase ccps ability to staff an even larger development team by contributing their subscriptions its a short term pain for a long term pleasure be patient its not your favorite features turn for touch up just yet but that doesnt mean it wont come now is the time to establish what things you want so that when it is time you get something you like from it
i dont care about vampires and console gamesim annoyed that the game im paying 240 a year for is being cannibalized to develop themif they want to develop new titles why dont they raise money in capital markets or sign a deal with a publisher like every other studio if they want to plow the healthy profits from a wellmaintained eve into other ventures thats their businesshowever i object when they cut support of eve below maintenance levels to boost their investment in other titles and ill vote with my pocketbook
everyone knows and loves overloadinghow about 3 new modules low mid highthe module when activated consumes waterice product and will negate heat to an extentfor example if i have a crow with 3 launchers overloaded 4th highslot goes to the watercooled heatsink modulei might get 2mins or so without watercooled with watercooled i might be able to keep going indefinitely if the the water supply is available crows can often have lots of room in their cargosimilarly i might be in a megathron with 7 neutrons without water i might get 2mins with water i could overload for much longer except my cargo is full of cap boosters and ammo i have to give up cap boosters in order to bring water alonggive and take
i would suspect ice products might be too bulkyalso the idea of using a cargo product is great if your amarr not so great if your one of the other races and also have to find space for ammowhat i would prefer is a some kind of heat sink thermal dump rig module and the ability to link specific modules to itlink to many items to it and you risk destroying it when overloadingif you also wish to use a fuel mechanic for it then i would look at using coolant preloaded in station or off carriers to extend its life in the field
witcheri think you misspelled ccp in your title you ask us to support cpp but then again maybe you intended to ask us to support opp and mispelled that if thats the case i do give that my full support
no
you can say its being lazy that i want to be able to effectively and efficiently control and program my drones to do what i want them to do but thats what they are automated robots whats wrong with setting them up to have greater functionality and less stress theyre already the most vulnerable weapon type in eve whats wrong with at least making them do what you want them to do while theyre there would it create more lag possibly but so does somebody spamming whatever hotkey theyre using to get the drones to engage the correct target which can avoided using this method and did i mention less stress whats wrong with being able to enjoy the game that much moreanyway the idea gets my full support mainly because the more options there are to counter falcons and other ewar ships the better
i have been pondering over this for about 4 months now and i believe i have figured something out at the moment we are unable to create implants simple find them or buy them i am proposing a system that would allow us the ability to build them much in the same way we build rigs from ship salvage imagine being able to scoop a corpse with 5s docking and using an instation moduleservice to reprocess the corpse for biomass material and implant salvage that could be used to create more implants if the corpse has no implants you could still get biomass from it and use it to create something else or sell it to the npcs for use in making clonesi am telling you people this would be genius we would be bringing in a whole new area of market bpo for implants and implant salvage plus all the other things like biomass and npc buy orders for them etc just give me some feedback and let me know if yall approve
i like it
i think that this would bring a hole new world to eve if you like this support it 
while the idea is intriguing i see some major problems with it first off it would bring about the ganking of pods even in highsecthere would be few if any ransoms and every pod would be destroyed for the salvageplayers would use alts to destroy their own alts just for the biomassnot supported
1 there is already high sec ganking for high value items pods are no different2 ransom lol3 you can already use your alts to destroy your alt ships for salvage but unless you are stupid for cheap ships only why would you stick imps in an alt pod and destroy it the same principle appliessupported
enthusiastically supportedpeople laughed when i said i was collecting corpses they thought i was creepy and steered clear of me whos laughing now muahahahahahaha
so you need people podded with implants in to be able to create implants so to make more someone first needs to lose implants that would be a bad mechanic imonot to mention i am against it to protect pirates against themselves would only decrease the amount of targets they have further
title says it all add an option to align to bookmarks its a must for fleet combat in wh and is the logical thing to do
add an eve time clock to the login screen
why 
so i dont have to log in to c wat the eve time is
there are already half a dozen ways you can check what time it is in eve without asking ccp to divert a team of people to waste time working on a clockbecause thats what theyll do you know and we wont see any expansions any more and eve will die
this is possibly the best proposal ever and extremely usefulsupport 100tamber
nothing against americans but may i do the guess you are one who else would need to login to find out the current eve timefor those unable to calculate themselves their local time to utc
this is ont of the most goddamn simple an usefull proposal around after moving the goddamn trash it button do it
i gladly sacryfice this in exchange for some new ships in eveinfact i would gladly sacryfice it for nothing in return
try c6 wspace dungeons when you can survive then come back if you are not satisfied
lf raid hogger 12 gearscore
anomalies aka know by ccp as dungeons since half of the designers dont play eve it looks like that orelse they would have fixed alot of issues allready i call it dungeons so they get what i mean810 and 1010 sansha are boring and a comlete waste of time im talking about double or triple sanctum spawns pve on pvp communication  play style so u actualy have to interact instead of farming sanctums all day in return people get more entertained by the 1825 bs spawns and the killfrenzy
only if this new type includes about 20 scrambling frigates so your still there in your carrier when i try to kill you
i dont know if the specific text of the mail falls under the nda or not regardless it didnt really say anything special just that im a member of the csm now it didnt even give me superpowers or anything
that doesnt tend to get any attentiondarius tried that many times to no avail try throwing a spoon at somebody i hear that carries some weight in the csmseriously though change the records to show mazz in 9th place and ankh with strikethrough script give her the medal im sure ankh would agree with me there and the csm delegate badge
the csm is really just an internet spaceship fraternitylet the hazing begin just dont let sok paddle you
hurrah for csm slap fight supported because griefing is fun d
the title say dont give so you are supporting giving the badge to mazz or not seeing that mazz was nominated she has the right to badge et alli dont like her positions about eve but as she has the role she should have all the perks and responsibilities
supporting this to show csm ignores this forum and promotes personal agenda when mazz gets her csm ticker anyway
i follow a very strict motto  support everything and ask about the details later
hello i come after having suffered the dire circustances of logging out in space my hulk which i saved up for forever to be able to buy and fly was destroyed due to my own ignorance of not knowing a pretty important aspect of the game before i could even use it to earn enough to insure it i am not some newb and have been playing the game for a great while though did not know that logging off while not in combat isnt really removing you from the game may my hulk rip and save other pilots who do not know the dangers of loggingwhat i am asking is that some warnings are put into the game to warn both new players and some veterans like myself who just have no idea that there is danger in logging out in space in particular in the tutorial at the beginning to warn players about the games noninstant logging out or if a pilot has a pve flag as the gms so nicely put it they recieve a warning message much like the one for using a 4 or below gate warning of the inherant danger but allowing them to ignore it if they choose
veteran right
wow yeah ive been playing off and on for like 7 years and have logged out in space many many timeswasnt aware i could die after i logged out then again im pretty carebear
this ways you still need to dock and undocking is the point where you can be vulnerable to attacks if not handled properlynow if you allow remote mission access that would remove yet another point for pvp making it even harder to get a fight then it is now
a skill based option to acceptdeclinecomplete missions in space is excellent if the mission doesnt require you to pick up or drop something off with agentcould make the skill level represent the agent level ie  lv 1 skill for lv 1 agent lv 2 skill for lv 2 agent lv 3 skill for lv 3 agent etc
i would like to have my privacy so i would like to be able to remove every single log when i sell a character like the wallet transactions private contracts killmails etc i am not sure how great this would be but worth the proposal
yes i think this should be doneclearing contract history would be abused by scammers to clean their past transactions so this feature needs to be outside of player control and be applied automatically on char sale yes still leaves an option but it costs
not supported the selling of characters should not be supported i think ccp feels the same way althought they have allowed it to keep people from doing it behind their backs it should not be encouraged
ccp does not feel the same way
the things i read there seem to be to protect people from getting screwed by friendcorpmates character having a new owner not to help out the person selling the charactera person transfering a character and that new owner stealing everything from a corp should be stopped hence the delay put on characters but helping people who sell account is different
almost every 00 alliance has a jump bridge network the ability to open your map and see not only your current destination but also its relation to any jump bridge network you have access to the routes could either be entered by each pilot or by an authorized alliancecorp official they would be color coded to show who owns said jump bridges and even maybe notifications that would show if any bridges have been reported as being out of fuel you as a pilot would have the ability to hide or show bridge networks or only specific networks belonging to certain alliancescorpsthis would really help fleets in 00 when coordinating just about anything be in logistics or roaming while being able to see your eve destination and how the two paths interact with each other
because dropping capitals at gatesstations on subcaps  capital fight also just as a counterargument thered be nothing to prevent you from lighting your cyno elsewhere and then warping a capital fleet to the fight and engaging enemy capitals
i understand the ops idea but as was said itd be much more broadly useful to affect any and every thing with mass i genuinely like the idea particularly since its not truly agressing anyone since theres no damage or ew being appliedjust forcing a change in their position which can also happen by bumping alreadyas a side note i think the range should be much much wider but act like gravity truly actsthat it will pull in with a force proportional to the distance from the gravity field it just makes a lot more sense that waytractor beams will still have their role as the time it takes for a single object mass to be pulled toward the gravity well or the gravity well toward the object mass will be much longer from max tractor beam distance plus tractor beams do not alter the operators flight trajectory but the gravity well can and willit would need to be used with care otherwise the operator of the gravity well may well find themselves being drawn towards stations or other large objects and thus possibly into less or more advantageous situationsit would create new strategies and open up an entirely different aspect of gameplay all without directly causing anyone to take any damage or otherwise be affected by electronic warfare so there isnt even an issue with more concord response and thus no extra lag from that standpoint unfortunately the mechanics of affecting so many objects with mass at so great a distance would create more lagso a limit on the distance would be appropriate not sure what that distance should beon another interesting sidenote from a logical standpoint it would make missiles hit the gravity field operator more precisely p

while id also like to own a personal pos theres a couple of issues if youre in an npc corp the pos is immune to wardecs possible solution only allow personal pos while you are in a player corp if wardeced youre alone to defend it because you wont have the option to assigning roles to other people knowing ccp wont touch pos and access control code with a ten foot pole its one more feature towards a massively singleplayer online gameso not supported
i also have posted a version of thiseverytime people bring up sandbox blablablbalbalbalbaah ccp does it for their tournaments so why not for some player run events im not sure about the 1 vs 1 business as you can do this anyway  but as someone whos had 50 people can flipping i can tell you this would be nice and someone whod regularily like to give away free rare ships i can assure you that this would be a nice featuretamber
if its good enough for the bitter old veteran community it should be good enough for the exciting young newbie community
i agree might as well make it so that ships can not engage each other outside stations in high sec systems unless they have wardec if they want to fight they need to go to the arena that might help relieve some lag or stress on the server

ccps expansions have been exceptionally good except for the last two dominion and tyrannis and it seems clear they are subpar because ccp did not have enough people working on them as they had on previous expansionsi dont see how paying extra for a dedicated eve expansion team would be pointless they could fix a ton of bugs and give us a better player experience ccp has made it quite clear that the full eve team will not be back until 18 months when incarnadust comes back and no amount of whining or ingame demonstrations is going to change that the op is asking you to put your money where your mouth is are you willing to pay a little extra to get eve back or are you just going to sit there and whine about it
tell you what you start paying for updates and ill take a break from eve for a few months let me know when they finally get off there ass and fix there damn productoh waitnot gonna happen for 18 months to a couple yearsdamn shucks on welltroll
qft
blizzard can charge for its wow expansions because they are extremely polished products which add a tremendous amount of content to the game and take years to develop essentially it takes as long to go from 7080 as it did to go from 160 and that doesnt include the massive amount of endgame content it includes ccp simply would not be justified in charging for two expansions a year even if they were the best biannual expansions ever made because biannual expansions will simply never have that much content
unsupported adding such features will just force people to use ventts to the exclusion of eve voice
i propose that periodically ccp issues a release that includes 10 smaller items from the backlog assault frigs rockets balancing issues etc nothing huge like a fw rewrite or entire new pos system things that can be reasonably accomplished by a scrum team in  200400 manhours 12 full weeks for a 5 person team next to each item they include a target  of plex players are then free to donate plex towards whichever item they feel should be fixed once an item has the required number of plex it is tasked to a team and a new backlog item takes it place on the listin this way players can directly influence which fixes are being looked at the extra plex donated to ccp result in an effective transfer of real life money to ccp to compensate for developer time
why the  should i have to bribe ccp do to the job they are already supposed to do for a game i pay to play for alreadyim a paying customer screw the donations i want my product the way it was advertised as such pure and simplethats like saying pay me 30 usd and ill fix this glitch i seriously doubt ccp is that hardpressed for funds
400 manhours can easily run ccp somewhere on the order of 16000 or around a thousand plex you might think you can get a dozen guys to chip in 300m each and get rockets fixed but the price is simply not something that we would be willing to pay if it was over and above our subscription fees the plex is an appropriate unit of measure for some server bandwidth and the odd petition but dev time needs to be amortized more broadly voluntary contributions simply wont cut it the tragedy of the commons will see to that the problem is how our subscriptions are being used not whether theres enough of them
not supportedi fail to see why i should pay a subscription and need to bribe ccp to maintain the game im already paying for
no its not on the priority list but in the future i think it would be a nice touch on the features especially since they have the code setup to do it on our own ships i cant imagine itd be that hard to do the same for other ships your viewing although im by no means a programmer and this could be incredibly difficult for all i know
eve is already plenty big plenty of lowsechighsecnullsec under exploited what they should do as ive supported in another thread is kill the highsec expressways between empiresmaking lowsec more intergral to crossing the galaxy as i believe it once was being able to stay safe traveling between opposing empires is to put it lightlya little lameplus the expressways which are just about everywhere cut down the travel time significantly from what it used to be to get across the galaxy but to prevent it from being impossible to cross lowsec multiple routes and less chokepoints need to be ensured 00 has plenty of systems completely unfrequented its just that when alliancescoalitions clash they each bring like 2000 players or some such nonsense to contest one system it seems like the first ones to break up their forces to hit multiple fronts at the same time will just loose every battle for having divided their force against a super blob in the first place but the drawback of a superblob is it cant be everywhere at once whereas smaller fleets could hit several places at a time confusing intel channels and disrupting reinforcement chains eventually superblobs would have to split their forces to respond to multiple threats this is the tatics employed against larger forces in rl military excerciess would it work for eve i dont know not many fcs like dividing their forces so superblobs in single systems are the norm doing the equivilent of a rumble in a parking lot really though you should try to flood many systems at once forcing enemy capships to priortize clashes as their intel struggles to know where your main attack will be
ccp just added a huge number of systems to eve last year wspace that combined with how little of our current space is being used makes me not support this
eve is far to small we need many many more systems
your bad at trolling
you might be right about that there may well be similarities since ccp couldnt find a hooker in a  house i would be suspicious that ccp stole game design and coding from eva that would sound like the most realistic scenario
thats right blow your own trumpet tell us what youve done after reading the threadnought about ccp zulus blog i looked up the wiki which says youve managed to get 6 issues resolved in 5 csm termsis this accurate
absolutely brilliant thread i approve thread of the week
saying six issues is uninformativewhich six issueshow soon after they were proposed were they fixedhow many issues have been put forward that have not yet been dealt with and how long has it been since those issues were put forwardsix issues over five years would be a great track record if they only made six suggestions and each one was fixed within minutes of proposing them
each other you mean 
the csm cant achieve anything if ccp refuses to ever work on things they bring uptheres a link in the op with details
if i could blow myself id never leave the house never mind get on a plane to iceland
thats so disgusting i mean men are so disgustingly obsessed with getting themselves off your hand will do  its all youll get
in time for whatthe death of evethis is not a troll post but a genuine question
i doubt itll get that bad lets just say in time to avoid serious damage to eves brand and player base
notes sokratesz official looking forum badgeyes sir right away all tags enabled
traditionally you would start building out unit tests for those sections of code so you would have some confidence around going in and changingrefactoring i suspect though that paying down technical debt meets the same objection as feature polishing or even worse as it is essentially invisible to the paying customersthe other troubling thing i noted from the csm minutes is the constant refrain of expectations management your typical agile response to this at least for internal constituencies would be transparency you publish the stack ranked list of things youre working on and update that at the end of every sprint youre always going to have people disappointed but that is mitigated somewhat by over communicationnow obviously ccp feels some of the details are market sensitive but i suspect this could be mitigated somewhat by either only listing polishbug fix items or simply changing descriptions for external purposes something like winter expansion feature 4321
edit fixed linkthank you csm in particular the visible work of teadaze as secretary  i voted for you based on your performance last csm and now mynxee for chairing and challenging ccp so carefully and competently  i will be voting for you in future csms however im posting here to recommend that you listen to the recent lost in eve podcast for the interview with both of these fine capsuleer representatives
ankh was more dedicated to csm and did more for it than any other member of that sad club the other csm members are not that useful and should be proud to wear the same badge like ankhe as long as we the voters dont get full detail on her misbehaviour and the truth why our votes dont count anymore ankh is to be seen as a victim by ccps information control policy or even martyr for free information access and freedom of speech
your vote doesnt count any more because you backed a loser anyone who couldnt see her for a poison trying to kill eve deserves to have voting rights revoked imho
and you have a secret gift of clairvoyance so that you can look in her head and discover her intentions  or can you offer us some solid evidence an example that backs your ridiculous accusation 
posting to confirm that the gods of the web team have been contacted to have this rectified
seconded i regret the trouble she caused for ccp but im grateful she lit her own petardankhesentapemkah the real reason the web team cant solve lag
while everything you say is true its also extremely hilarious that she has it and mazillu doesnt and therefore i must reluctantly decline to support your campaign and further assert that your mother smelled of elderberries
fyp
keep up the good work mynxee this is why i voted for you i feel confident you alone can inspire a change in the status quo  render our playerscsmccpdevs idea exchange move useful i know it wont happen overnight but im sure you wont settle for lesscheers sanedit just read that back and realized i forgot to thank the rest of the csm who are also doing a great job thanks
i wanted to post here first so i wouldnt goof up with some conflicting aspect i recently proposed something that i was then told already happenedanyone know if that target lock filter would totally bugger up and lag out the overview i have a feeling shifting state things tend to do that but for the most part it works if someone goes gcc as your overview can handle that without too much trouble
supported current concept is terrible how do my moon minerals magically float from the harvester to the silo and i know this is the future but no matter how many years pass and no matter how advanced we get in technology electricity always needs to have a path to route to that being said how are my modules powered by my command center when they are not connected when i play games i play to immerse myself into the virtual world so i like realism
this
an excellent idea very much supported
supportedtactical overlay needs more juice
did not realize that you could not fit a cloak to a black ops bs have just wasted 40 days of training to find that i would be flying ship inferior in most respects to my current bs i whole heartedly agree that the ability to cloak would make this type of ship more useful
45 ly is a joke triple itbut even then theyll just be used as cheap titans for bombers and recons definitely buff the resists and agility probably give them a covops cloak too
the reviews are inthe populace demands excellence
ill take a large excellence with a side of awesome hold the dust pleaseseriouslyeve has had two meh expansions one with extra lag and one with allyoucanstomach clicking time to change that ccpthe goodwill youd earned with qr apocrypha etc has been spent now its time to earn it back now youre just another software developer not the friendly neighborhood awesome factory you used to be please change my mind i beg of youi want to believe but i do require proof youre worth my time and money alliance tourney viii was pretty damn cool though keep that going at all costsgi mig en tudekiks nu
supported and agreed toi wonder if anyone has sent this threadcontent to mmorpgcomperhaps its time we had some outside visibility on what the issues are and why this is importantit seems to me that ccp wants to add new expansions to gain player base if the potential new player base understands that ccp is not listening to its current players and that there are a lot of broken features perhaps it will make a dent on their strategy to gain new playersjust a thought but i dont think were going to get a response until outside pressure starts to build too
i agree
in software engineering theres a thing called goldplating costly polishing the client didnt order the line between excellence and goldplating is extremely thin but it all mounts up to  release new feature fix until client thinks its goodversus fix until coder thinks its good release new featureit would seem ccp has mixed up the two or actually theyve mixed up release new feature ignore results with excellence

signedaddendum id like to see drone faction ships with drone minerals as requirements for creation granted a drone dominix wouldnt sound very balanced but when you have heavy hitters like the machriel to contend withand it wouldnt just be the gallente getting the drone faction ships theres multiple other factions out there that the rogue drones come into contact with having a crazy buggedout raven or typhoon doesnt sound like that bad of an idea

after hearing about riches and fame in 00 i joined up to a corporation in cobalt edge when i got there i was thinking money enter my pocket or something along those lines was i expecting to stay docked and get rich just magically no what i was expecting was to make more money than the lv 4 missions i was running earlier that day what i ended up doing is finding out that i can only make money with the battleships in the belts which seem to have more ehp than the mission rats i was killing and if i got lucky i would make 5 mil a night 2 hrs of play long story short after 2 weeks i jump cloned back to high sec and started making actual money againyou may be thinking cry me a river but i remember hearing somewhere the ccp wants people to get out of high sec and their lv 4 missions and try zerosec how can they do that if the drone regions make it nearly impossible to support yourself much less your corporationedit bounties for drones
agreedits dissapointing when i can make more money an hour doing lvl 4 missions than in 00 space come on ccp you were talking about risk vs reward ratio nice one

has anyone noticed btw that almost all datacore prices are way down in the past yeareverything is down between 25 and 65 except for minnie starship i guess vagas etc have become more popular with players in the past year and plasma physics  caldari starship cores more or less held stable and everything else is way downmy next thought is what is the equilibrium price lets say you get an account you raf it and effectively get a free 45 days you then have to pay roughly 600m for 2 more plex while you train up rpm 4 on all 3 toons on that account a science skill to 4 negotiationconnectionssocial to 4 i assume youre running them through missions on an alt it took me maybe 40 hours  was a while ago to run one of my alts up to 78 standing with carthum and that was in a crappy double lar dominix with t1 drones with a marauder or somesuch im sure itd be much faster but its not like youre not getting paid for these missions anywaysthe finished product should yield roughly 8 datacores per day per toon 24 datacores per acctday thats about 700 datacores per month with a startup cost of 600m and a 2 month lead time you could probably train them up more science skill to 5 or rpm to 5 or even negotiation to 5 but at these price levels its not really costeffective though since this feature has existed for years it probably was at some point and over a sufficiently long time horizon youd make back the extra iskif you buy 1 plex every 6 months thereaftermonth 8 900m spent 4200 datacores  215kcoremonth 14 12b spent 8400 datacores  143kcoremonth 20 15b spent 126k datacores  120kcoreits difficult to say how big the impact of this activity is of course because we dont know how many cores are consumed per day nor do we know how widespread this activity is nonetheless market prices generally converge to the marginal cost and are determined by the lowest cost supplier i think its pretty obviously bad for the game but i also think its bad for the game to take all the devs and put them on vampires of xbox so what do i know on the other hand at least if i decide to cancel more of my accounts while the folks at ccp develop other games ill have datacores to come back to if i ever feel like returning
best csm request since the corpse catapult100 support it
raised for discussion at the july 25th csm meetingwiki link
not supported also this
why is that a problemi dont agree with your assertion that it will make pilots go after pods over viable combat ships but i sure hope your assertion is true if my gang is fighting your gang id prefer your gang mates lose their composure and go after pods during the fight rather than focusing your firepower on ships that are still shooting them
get jump clones use a clone without implants when you know you are going into a suicidal fight pretty standard procedure
i never really know when i will end up in a suicidal fight if i did i guess jump clones would work wellbeside the fact that it will further discourage people from going into pvp i think the other disadvantage is that killing pods is not really combat i mean its not like you say wow how did you manage to bring down that pod in your rifter the answers will almost always go along the lines of well he was in a pod and pods cant shoot back really the most common 3 answers wont really demonstrate much in the way of combat skill by the podding party1 he was in a bubble and couldnt slow boat his pod out of the bubble in time2 he was in a pod and must have been new so didnt realize he should start hitting warp to a distant celestial once he is in structure3 he must have experienced lag or some other technical glitch preventing him from warping hence to the extent killboard stats supposedly are some indication of skill it would further skew them
right older players will think like you they have many skills already trained up so no need to use expensive attribute implants go into a jump clone for 24 hours or so with a bare clone you have no intention of flying a cladari dreadnaught so caldari dreadnaught 5 can wait meanwhile newer players are anxiously trying to finish getting t2 guns on that cruiser they are flying and arent too keen to have to wait a day with no implants if they want to pvp even if veteran players use the attribute implants they have built up resources to replace them when they are lost so its not such a big deal  for them but for a new player those plus 4s or even plus 3 implants probably cost many times more than their ship and mods incentives to podding will hurt newer players much harder than veteran players so to the extent you create additional incentives to go after pods you create disincentives for newer players to pvp its that simple
edit this proposal has been changed to support character gender changes only this thread no longer supports race andor bloodline changesread before postingi want to propose an idea for incarna when it comes out and i figured id throw this idea out there now while its still in the development stages first off im a guy irl and my character is a gallente female i made this cause i didnt even care and thought it didnt matter as it was just a sorta passport photo and i also didnt know about this incarna feature untill months after i started playing but having read up on it i absolutly do not want to be wandering around a station in a female avatar that is just completly wrong in so many ways it would completly ruin the whole experience and i would not be able to immerse myself into it as i am not a woman it would completly cut off my ability to immerse myself into the game and ccp you said you wanted to create the ultimate scifi simulator well i want to be able to create an avatar that looks as much like i do in real life as possible and a gallente female is not iti did research on google before posting this and found many other forums with the same idea all of which are over 90days old and have been closedmost of them wanting to change their race and bloodline for roleplaying purposes or whatever and seeing as their are no stat differences or different gameplay mechanics whatsoever between different genders this should be another added account service sure that would take some coding and other technical work i dont know exactly how it would be done if ccp actually decided to do this but i just wanted to throw the idea out there once more also it would only be a cosmetic change not stats or anything main thing is i dont want to walk around a station as a woman and be one of those nerds that walks around in a halfnaked female avatar anyways i screwed up in the character creation process and have been regretting it since i heard about this incarna feature and skills take far too long to just start another character and i know im not the only oneand as for not being able to justify implementing this ingame cause of reasonable rollplaying aspects like was said in a previous post ccp after making the entire universe of eve and all its coolness there is no way you can bs me into saying you dont have the creativity to come up with something that worksand one last thing i do not support the idea of name changes your name is your reputation and that is the one thing you absolutely must stick with we cant have people completely stealing everything from their corp running off getting a name change and then joining the same corp to do it all over againthis proposal no longer supports racebloodline changes and has been changed to allow for character gender change only i figured id say this again cause people still arent reading itsupport for gender change only
1 make new character on your account for free2 use said character to rp and run around stations all willy nilly3 4 profit
skyee you know that just completly defeats the purposeeven if you dont care for this it will be a payable feature so those who actually give a s about something like this can have the option to pay ccp for it more money to ccp  better products from ccpcheck this out blizzard entertainment released an account option for their game world of warcraft which allowed players to buy a virtual flying horse for 25 blizzard made over 14 million dollars on that horse the very first day it became available now i guess you could relate that to ccp selling ingame ships online for real money which ccp will never do and should never do but its the same concept i know a fair amount of people who are unhappy with their charactersso why not let those few pay to make the game better for all of us
but then there will be no more caldari achura left
i like my character just the way it is personally but i think hes gota point there supported
helloi thought of this idea a few days ago and ive come to find that i really like it hopefully you guys do alsothere comes a time when you must upgrade your implants unless you have l33t 5s but to do so with the current mechanics you must destroy the current one this always feels like a waste same thing goes with ship rigs  once you rig a ship it is destined to follow whatever role you first intended when you rigged it and deviating from that initial role will more or less gimp itthese game mechanics limits the options of what a player can do rigging a ship for one thing and then deciding to use it for something completely different latter one is usually not an option however i also do not believe saving the rigs should be riskfree thus i am proposing a new mechanic based on skills that allow you to have up to a 50 chance to save those implants and those rigs two skills one for each implants and rigs each level raises the chance to save by 10 lvl0 untrained  0 lvl5  50 the rank on the skill shouldnt be too high so that new players who i think will benefit from this the most since those with 5 rarely want to change out their implants but then again shouldnt be too low im thinking 3 or 4 the best possible chance you can get with lvl5 skills is like a coin toss which i think is fairtell me what you think
oh and demichael the reason for limiting the bpc runs to 3 modules per print was to limit the availability of the items further if indeed the attribute meta level was increased sort of a balancing act may be dodgy logic but it seemed to me that if you were to boost these items significantly their availability should be limited as well
full support to this
ccp has made it pretty clear they dont give a rats ass about fixing the game they would rather spend their time making dust and nice new avatar faces and stations  features none of us players could care less aboutsupported

sorry i dont support ccp anymorethe interesting thing op is that you assume we are trying to hurt or damage ccp through this action and through our postings  by criticizing them and by demanding that they change their direction and this couldnt be further from the truthwe are attempting to help themhow are we attempting to help them im sure youre asking yourselfif there is a problem amongst the player base or a significant issue which could jeapordize the game  that being paying subscribers will cancel their accounts and move on to another mmo then we have a duty as people who enjoy and care about this game to bring it to ccps attentionthe fact islarge portions of the game are broken the number of broken features in the game keep increasing the list of broken features has been well documented by the csm and presented to ccpthe player base has used the available channels and processes to present these issues to ccp and express the players concern regarding these issues those concerns have been ignored in favour of creating yet more new shinys and really imo trying to make something so new and cutting edge in order to give themselves a pat on the back and be industry groundbreakers ie egoimo  this could very well be the death of eve if it continues moving along this pathi dont know what the corporate culture is like within ccp but im getting the feeling it is truly one of arrogance and we know better than you and one of indulgence as well this i cannot support
i support ccp every month with my subscription paymentand thats all they are getting atm
tldr dont like the game quit playing either that or stfui truly support what the op is trying to get across and no im not trollinglet me first start by saying that i understand everyones argument  it does seem silly that little things like rockets or glitchy timers arent being fixed in a timely manner if i was a developer i would take a quick minute to fix many of the bugs but what a lot of people dont understand is that this is a company in which all decision big or small need to be thought out and run by everyone before their implemented they cant say hmm i think im just going to ninja this fix in  it needs to go through the proper channels just like everything else ccp is a company first and foremost and will do what they think is right for the company just because you pay them doesnt mean you tell them what to do for all those i pay them so i demand they listen to me  no you payed them to access this wonderful game what they do for expansions and patches is up to them even moreso since the patches are 100 free if you dont like playing the game that they have offered then quit playing its quite as simple as that if you truly think that the game is so bugged and that ccp doesnt give a damn about its playerbase then wtf are you still doing hereits disgraceful when you have idiots shouting fix the lag whenever a dev blog appears even when the dev blog isnt relevant to anything of that nature when everyone knows that lag is probably the hardest technical problem ccp comes across and will probably never fully solve due to the nature of ityes im also a little peeved that they are devoting most of their resources to new projects rather than taking a week to fix and balance rockets and the small stuff but i also understand that they are a company trying to make a profit and to do that they need something to sell they cant release an expansion a free goddamn expansion and try to sell it with eve online the bug fix expansion they need new content that will draw new players into the game at the moment that new content is incarna and the dust interaction which are both major releases up to the scale of the trinity patch i wasnt around back then but i dont know of anyone who has ever said damn i wished they fixed the damn rockets instead of adding new shiny models to the game i loved my blocky thrasher it didnt need an upgradebe thankful that this company is as transparent as it is had this game been made by blizzard you would have to pay for the expansions in between of which youll get almost no insight into the company or the game and there would be exclusive betas and not the freely accessible test server ccp does a lot for usim disgusted by all the people frothing at the mouth yes the game has problems that really need to be addressed yes ccp has been a little too enthusiastic with its vision for the future but i do not believe that ccp is telling its playerbase to stfu like so many on these forums claim they doi support ccp and the work they have done so far even though i may not be entirely thrilled with some of the decisions that have made like the saying goes you cant win em all to those complaining stfu or quit the game whatever youre complaining about is obviously not enough to get you to quite since youre still here ccp is aware of all the problems they dont need its playerbase to jump at them at every chance
signedoh and op please tell me where you fly your primae id like to uhm come and tickle it with my lolkets
dear god yes please drone ui is terribad
yes but ccp has not been recording what implants were in those corpses heads therefore all old corpses would have to be treated as unimplantedas it is you destroy an implant by removing it if you could somehow get it out when the persons capsule has been blown into little shards i would think that you could simply unplug one while alivetoo much to change not supported
already passed by the csm
cool im glad to see the simplist things get noticed for once
or just use evemon this sounds more like a waste of time for the devs
anybody who does a significant amout of missioning or involves themselves in factional warfare will sooner or later become kill on sight to one of the empire factions there is currently no way to avoid systems belonging to hostile factions on routes generated by the autopilot this can lead to the possibility of embarrasing accidents as well as restrict the general utility of the autopilot for long journeysmy proposal is to include an option in the autopilot preferences menu to choose to avoid systems belonging to one or more of the empire factions or alternately to be allowed to avoid all those where the faction navy would have issues with your presence this would be a convenient change which would improve ease of gameplay
should have done this to begin with
im using systems avoidance list for that just add there the entrance systems of a hostile region
and what if you miss one you warp into a hostile factions space and lose whatever your flying when you afk
just pointing this outall t2 ships that are just a diffrent colour ti tech 1 version is because like all t2 its just a overhaul and improvemetn on that hull some of them like ishkur and enyo have slightly diffrent parts than the incurses and to each other simply because they are redesigned better varientsthis is why when you show info and go to varient it shows u all the same hulled t2faction so no they dnt need to diffrent hulls and no we do not need new ships only over the past 7 years allso learn 2 fly the current ships properly then ask for new ships
please request new ships only when you can already fly and own all of the ones available now otherwise stfu and train for what we have now

there are rules there and plenty of people choose not to follow them and clutter the caod forum with useless crap or nonsense replies to serious topicsid like to see some type of ban or suspension for these offenders simply locking threads is a pathetic excuse for moderation

nice idea also add there smt like you can decline more mishs not just one per 4 hrs
the idea of bringing pirate antipirate and neutral players together in low sec is an idea of under appreciated merit alongside a general principle of excellence ala dierdra vaal the csm has set forth several ideas that might also serve as principles for thinking about a low sec expansion eg a space of small gang not blob combat and a space for small holder not alliance influence id love to see a general low sec buff in terms of mining scannable sites missioning smuggling routes that bypass regular gates and so on yet we also need to ensure that low sec doesnt become any more of a pirate ghetto than it already is genghis suggestion might serve as a general principle to better integrate low sec into the rest of eve delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
i am happy you have spent the time thinking of a way to introduce players who normally wouldnt venture into low sec this however is forcing them you cant force people into low sec they wont go
oh so true nicely said amber fun aside yani i mean no disrespect but i think we all need to be more fair in our expectations of the csm we arent talking about simple technical changes as if anything in eve was simply technical or as if technical issues were themselves simple rather we are talking about policy issues with a technical dimension policy issues are much harder to change as they are based on values and culture in this case the values and culture of ccp and its player base please give the csm your support and a reasonable period of time to try and effect such change it may not work i acknowledge that yet it may and we will all be better off if it does delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
i think we should start improving eve by ending sexismall those in favor of podding delilah and amber say aye all those not in favor go post moar qq about hulkageddon and lowsec
wait till we tell what wed do if only we were really limber
csm has not exicted for 5 years it is more like 2 years
this is a very good point should have said terms  possibly should have been iterations as ccp seem to like that wordindeed i wasnt getting at the csm quite the opposite the current pandemic of nerdrage is getting out of hand for that reason i was looking for concise information that might be used as a form of medicine to help treat all these poor nerds in their hour of need
ah thanks for clarifying this and apologies for misunderstanding your intent
i would like to point out that the page in question is a wiki page as a wiki page it only is updated when someone updates it as it was last updated 1258 16 july 2009 by erik finnegan i propose that this is more a case of a wiki page that hasnt been updated and less an issue of csms ability to get issues resolvedin fact the page was only worked on by erik a csm 3 delegate so those are probably only issues resolved during csm 3 issues that he remembered to move on the wiki to resolvedi think the problem is that issues are often resolved outside the term of the csm who passed the proposal so there is less impetus to finalize the work of someone else simply to blow their horn as you elegantly put it
ccp needs to disband the csmid rather see all that money go into more development than see it squandered on the joke that is the csmthe fact that nearly their entire presentation at fanfest 2009 consisted of them trying to justify their very existence to the attendees illustrates how useless they are that broad from pl who showed up late hung over and simply stated thanks for the free trip to iceland really sealed the deal for me toodisband this joke asap
heres some lowhanging fruit that id like to raise for discussion
this csm is doing a fantastic job advocating players views i really dont think ccp was ready for this at all mynxee has really shined in this role you can tell she is familiar with professional atmospheres and knows how to get things done in those committee settings where less experienced people would get bamboozled she put her tenacity logic and tact to good use forcing ccp to face what players wantthe interview posted above is very good both teadaze and mynxee represent themselves and the players very well what happened with the minutes was brilliant mynxee claims she was shocked that ccp let the minutes be published without anyone trying to do some damage control but something in her voice inner glee leads me to think she knew they werent going to bother with them and it was going to blow up i think ccp has learned that they have to deal with this csm somehow because if they continue refuse to take any actions other than offering sincere looks and firm handshakes this csm is gonna call them on it nice job guys and gals
my god you killboard bois will complain about anything
not true you will never hear them complain about mining not being profitable enough
i would hire ank if i read her cv but then again that is a complete and utter lie because i actually play eve
aeron im not in a technical field so i looked up iso 9001 via google i may be quite off but i assume you are posting it here because it provides an alternative to ccps waterfall style of producing code would you be so kind as to say more about the standard and why you think it would be of help to eve thanks in advance delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
over the last few days ive been reading the many posts regarding csm and ccpmy own personal feelings are that ccp have created a no win situation for the csmalso the reaction of many people on the forum have also added to thisall the csm can do is put forward our own feelings about eve they can not force ccp to do anythingi will admit that are some things i feel the csm could do better things which have already been mentioned in various others threads however on whole i feel they are doing their best with the tools they have at their disposalfor those people who are complaining about the csm i have a question for you do you think you could do any better i can not see how much more the csm can doif ccp do not act on the advice given to them that is not the fault of the csmat the moment the reaction of the many people is that csm suck because ccp is not acting on their advice if they do then people accuse the csm of only proposing changes for their own interestsone thing i would like to know is is there any ccp member of staff who is in charge or has been delegated the task of communicating and liaising with the csm or is it very adhoc
to me the csm is a rather problematic entity and if there were a public voting to stop the whole thing id vote for itfirst they are not needed ccp has known for years what players want and care about by simply reading the forums and all the csms do is basicly present threads from the assembly hall forum to ccp ccp could as easily just watch for theese threads themselves all the discussions and meetings with ccp is just void if there is something that players badly want ccp will recognise it anywaysimho the only reason ccp holds onto the concept is so their marketing can advertise how eve online is the first mmo with a real democracy second is the issue of misconduct you can not tell me that the information passed onto the csm members is not subject of misconduct ccp can not control what they tell their ceos over teamspeak or what they do with accounts hidden behind a proxy or a vpn people are generally not so lacking of intelligence as larkonis for anyone with just a little bit of it knowledge it is very easy to set up an account that ccp can not track back to them and again even if they could all it takes is a friend and a small teamspeak session if you really believe this is not happening just now then you are really rather naivetldr csm is uneeded and provide issues of misconduct
ccp needs to disband the csm id rather see all that money go into more development than see it squandered on the joke that is the csm the fact that nearly their entire presentation at fanfest 2009 consisted of them trying to justify their very existence to the attendees illustrates how useless they are that broad from pl who showed up late hung over and simply stated thanks for the free trip to iceland really sealed the deal for me too disband this joke asap

do they honestly believe incarna is going bring new people to eve when once they leave the dressup chat room theyre going to run into a lot of gameplay that needs a lot of workthey might well get given a frigate with rockets they may wonder why faction war isnt more fun they may well wonder why a stagnant 00 means a lot of corporations see no reason to recruit and train new players aggravated by the lack of treaties they might wonder why a 6 year old game has so few pve missions that theyre seeing repeats in their first couple of days they might wonder why the epic quest leaves people with a why did i bother feeling perhaps theyll look at the idea of spending 25 million isk and days of gaming time to master learning skills and wonder how that counts as funtheres no point in adding bags on the side if the core isnt healthy fun and evolving supported

ccp can at least have 2 or 3 of their 200 devs fix minor fw bugs instead of ignoring it altogetherdo not want new stuffs until old stuffs is not completely borken
fw is currently choking on a number of well documented problems and a general lack of new content it needs an investment of time and resources
hmm clear skies is in my mind fw is beyond fixing
yesfix the issues that you already know are there please
right click on an item and have an option to view contracts we can view market details on most items except those that are contract only why not in addition to the view market details option we would have an option to view contracts which would bring the contracts for that item up seems pretty logical to have
good work mr laforge number one get on that
yeshowever i think it would make sense to limit this to contractonly items for most normal market items it would just clutter up the menu interface more than it already is

this is for cosmetic purposes only no stat changes seeing as your race and bloodline dont offer any difference in stats anymorealso ive heard that you will one day be able to jump clone yourself into a jovian so maybe this is how it will be done like buy an ingame item like a jovian clone or minmatar clone kinda like you buy a plex i think it should be a payable feature tho so those who dont care about this feature will also profit from it in the long run more money for more development
given the function and description of eccm this seems more like a bug than a feature and it seems more likely that it persists because ccp are incapable of fixing it at this point the ability to make a sc unprobable is ridiculousthere are already valid mechanics in the game to accomplish this stuff theyre called cloaksuntil we see some blue text on this saying its an intended mechanic its a bug and users are exploiting you want to make t3 unprobable make a subsystem that explicitly states that it grants this ability and make it impossible for nonspecialty shipsdisappointing but not unexpected lack of response from ccp
prepares for countless rig skill whatever is broken threadseve is about planning and risk you can risk losing implants and the reward is faster skill training you can avoid the risk and the penalty is slower skill training
no
regarding implants most people i know simply get a new jumpclone any decent missionrunner shoud have access as well as anyone in 00 sov and plug the better implants into it that way you dont waste your old implants and have a nice backup clone in case you get poddedrigs why not simply get a new ship with cheap ships it shouldnt really be a problem of course what cheap is depends on your wallet and in case your rigs for your pimpmobil need to be replaced well t1 dont cost that much anymore and t2 im all in favor of having choices with consequences in game and they are getting fewer and fewerso no
if you are throwing 100m isk into 4 implants you are hardly going to be worried about the 20m you burn breaking the 3 implants if you are throwing 500m into 5 implants you shouldnt be worrying about the 100m you burn if you had 4 implants in already besides if you were rash and put in 4 implants for the what 20 days it takes to reach lvl 5 to put in 5 implants you definitely shouldnt be worrying about the 100m isk that you knew was going to die
nnnnnnnnnno
takes quite a while to gather up all the skills and special materials needed to produce most storyline modules and as it is now most of those modules arent worth the effort or the time to manufacture i agree that the 2 run bpcs should be raised to 3 runs but any other bpcs with 3 or more runs should stay the samemyself id rather see the attributes of all storyline modules increased to be better than tech 2 modules short version storyline modules should have equal or above attributes and lower fitting requirements compared to tech 2 modules
i have run all minmatar gallente concord soe thukker cosmos missions and those ore missions i could standing wise i really like cosmos missions the fixesyesid like to see soryline items equal but different to meta 4 or maybe t2 sureif its necessary for balancing ok i dont think it isyesi wont go into your additional ideas because cosmos needs fixing first and i dont see new stuff anytime soon for me the most important things are make the storyline items worthwhile fix the agents that are broken and add a few more ore high or lowsec agents so that you can actually run the current ore agents
storyline items should be better than t2 i have two storyline bpcs in my hanger that i never put the effort into building because they are worth less than manufacturing effort that makes those worse than getting a civilian gunminer drop if you think about iteverything else sounds like a good idea as well
i dont see new stuff anytime soon is part of the reason i posted this thread adding some agents some new constellations with agents and tossing some more crap into the item database cant be that hard i would love to see ccp prove me wrong on that front just because we dont see new epic arcs and new cosmos like content often doesnt mean we should lower our expectations unlike cough some recent content additions and some in the pipe that havent exactly had the cough best reactions from the playerbase i have never heard of anyone whining about cosmosit is the sort of content that adds just the right flavor to this game especially for those that cant stand most bland pve grindfests which means it makes things more attractive to new and existing subscribers from my standpoint when it comes to the development of content promote from within and focus on areas where you cant go wrong i see cosmos fitting the billeta for the priorities priorities fix this fix that crowd i could pick a constellation name 10 agents write 10 5part storylines and add 50 balanced rewards to the database in one working day easily if 1 guy cant pull that off he is doing it wrong
i think you are completly missing the fact that shields have a big advantage over armor in the fact they recharge armor does notevan a buffer tanked drake has a respectable recharge on its shield that any buffer armor tanker does not have i dont particulerly want rr drakes to dominate the battlefield and myself as a pure armor tanker pilot think that the current set up for the rrs is fine not supported
lol if you dont use the modules how would you know if there is a fitting issue or not
armor has higher base resists nerf armorif you would ever fly in any pvp rr fleet you would know the self recharge of shields is irrelevantstill it stays confusing one side is still arguing shield rr should be impossible to fit on most bs because otherwise they would be overpowered while the other ones argue it should be impossible to fit it since otherwise it is still useless
because my girlfriend flys caldari and i use her account a lot so i can and do fly caldari and shield tankers on her account just not mine 
so how often did you use her account to fly in a shield tanked ship in a nonnano gang of serious size so something where you would want shield spider tank did you ever happen to get shot if yes how come you missed that your self recharge was completely irrelevantbtw protip admitting to eula violation on the official forums is not that bright i personally dont have problems with people doing that but it just isnt really smart to admit it here
agreeing with sok yes the two modules are a bit weirdly balanced but the problem from my experience in spider shield gangs is the slot requirements for the tank not the rr module itselfnot supported
you could lower the cpu needs to 0 and people still would fly rr armor gangs insteadif you cant understand why then you should probably stop posting till you do
losing skills for dieing in your t3 ship is completely unnecessary isnt losing half a billion isk enough of a penaltysome of people may say lol nub eject its not that hardwell there are plenty of reasons why one would die while still onboard a t3 ship likelagalphadlagforgetting while in the mist of an adrenaline pumping good battlemore lagemergency need to leave pcserver crashdid i mention lagmaybe have an option of some type of insurance thing one needs to pay before they board t3 ship like we do with our clones a module that negates losing skill
you know the risks prior to boarding the shipits a great unique factor to t3 and its not like its a long retrain
i see nothing great in losing skills and them being not long to train doesnt negate the fact that its just completely unnecessarysupporting my own thread
op might nog agree with the second point  k matter of opinion  but first reason still standsso not supported
given how powerful t3 ships are i think the penalty is finenot supported
no penalty is not fine read carefully they are powerfull but also expensive compared to other equal sized ships im for removing this penalty or make it change not loosing some skill but lets say you will be not able to pilot another t3 for 2 days or so
invalid completely voluntary just dont take t3 to lagfestsinvalid how the hell does a cruiser with 150200k buffer get alphaedinvalid his doesnt even make sense why should ccp base their designs on peoples doorbells pizza deliveries incontinence invalid pretty damn rare node crashes are far more frequent refer to first lineall in all a pretty damn bad suggestion with even worse argumentation
they used to be expensive nowadays they are cheap imho and comparing t3 cruiser with hacs or recons is kind of lol take a proteus with the armor amount subsystem and you get what 300k ehp  700ish dpsyou get close to bs performance out it so your comparison with t2 cruisers is weakuhm  it takes about 34 days to train the subsystem skill back to 5 and you dont want to fly a t3 without the subsystem skills to 5 anyway so there is your few days period where you cant fly t3proud owner of 4 t3 ships atm and soon to be 5 or 6 anyone got a good gang link legion fit ideally with 23 gang links
the reason why you are still in the ship when it is destroyed has no bearing on the discussionlosing a t3 ship is the only way to lose skill point that dont involve losing the pod and forgetting before entering combat to upgrade the clone skill point is the only currency in game that you cant replace with some effort but only with the passage of time so losing them should be limited to the pod destruction supported
recons are not only powerfull but also expensive compared to other equal sized t1 ships i agree with you the penalty for losing a recon losing a lot of isk should be significantly reduced or eliminated after all a curse is 40x more expensive than an arbitrator but i might lose a curse to lag or a server crash or it might get alphador you could just accept that there are risks to flying t3 ships just like there are risks to flying t2 the risks for t3 are much steeper than t2 but that matches their incredible increase in power
here is a thought if you cant handle loosing t3 ships dont fly them
i heard a rumour that losing a t4 ship will require one to commit suicide irl
i still think its a cool feature wouldnt stop me flying onenot supported
no
no its not lag can strike at anytime ive tested pvping with t3s on the test server although you can escape most of the time sometimes you can spam eject all you want but you still dont leave your dam ship so buffer is the only valid way to tank your t3 ship now because lost skill time is the only thing in this game your not getting backit still happensmaybe they can change the skill loss penalty with some other penalty not being able to use your t3 for a certain amount of time like someone else suggestedi just think ccp shouldnt involve skill loss as a penalty for anything and if they do it should be easily avoidable like updating your clone
its about as easy as not flying your t3 shipdont want to lose sp dont fly a ship that makes it so you lose sp if it diestaingda
yes but is it really necessary plus removing this penalty will encourage more people to fly t3s
i dont mind itinfact they should make the addition of all the rank 1 skills are in the mix also balanced against perhaps not losing all the sp from a skill necessarily its just an amount of spso you drop lvl 5 to like 45 or 4 to 275
spoiler inbounddont fly the ships if you dont want to risk your skillpointsim in one a lot it makes the fights more exciting of course youd know that if you liked to fight however you dont you like to play this game and it has fighting in it which is ok because you avoid that like the plague however this one ship that you really really really like to fly also has this terribly scary penalty that might occurso you made a thread about it
thanks for your support guys anyone else got any thoughts
actually vacuum is one of the best heat insulators there is in existenceor notwe are talking about however is something which can supplement overloading far more actively then offlined modulesmoreover they could implement a graphic for the watercooling of steam coming from the ship
yes please1 for god sakes yes i just recently moved to drone space and you have to pick destroyer with many high slots but no cargo or industrial with next to no high slots and high ammounts of cargo seeing as drones drop nothing but alloys picking between or using only 1 is a huge pain2 decent cargo space too please iv been struggling with a myrmidon or another bc just to fit the 5 harvesters and i can only use it in a fleet op unless i wanna jet can mine which isnt smart to began with no matter who you are or where you are3 i dont agree to much with this last one sence unless you increase the cargo size to over 38k m3s my mark 5 no matter what you do is gonna hold more unless it can compress planet materials
supporting this so hard di love the primae model but the stats are so meh d
i agree the primae is a junker the only thing its actually good for is being a better shuttle in fact its almost like the t2 version of a typical shuttle only that it has better cargo and a couple of slots thats all its good for at the momenti would recommend setting the ship up for its original purpose before ore tried to scrap make it a more formidable salvage ship something that can outsalvage a catalyst
i like our second suggestion at least the ship could be used for something now itll omly collect dust
this in a huge way cool ship definitely idea 1
idea 1 rules
i guess thats worse then an instalocking remote sensor boosted remote repaired lachesis
not supported we dont need frigate gate camps in low sec travel is dangerous enough as it is in regards to no one going there to pvp because they dont want to bring a bsbc well thats bull go to a populated system with your frigate gang and warp to the top belt youll get some action the top belt in amamake isnt called the glory belt for nothingedit rrd remote sensor boosted lachesis is really specialized though ive only seen that once in nearly 2 years of living in low sec its cool as  though
some of the more mentioned topics in si and gd but i didnt see them on the first 6 pages so i figured id bring them up1 increase brightnesscontrast of mineral scan overlay  presently if a material is in low concentrations it is very possible for its hotspots to fade into the background or be impossible to pick out against the planet image especially problematic on plasma planets2 allow grouping of extractors and massselecting cycle time  this would vastly reduce the carpaltunnel inducing clickfest3 reduce storage facility cpugrid  right now they are absolute hogs and not worth the fitting cost a reduction would make them viable and even attractive for longterm pi storage
was searching for a thread about pi clickfest on the hall and seems its the only one on the 1st ten pages strange1  not really bothered by that we can adjust colors2  oh yeah baby i finally stopped clickfesting 2 days ago even if it take me less than 30mn for all alts it was so boring having to do this much clicking for the current pi pricethe problem about having to click a new link each day was corrected on beta meaning they care about thisbut nothing about having to click extractor each day we at least need a csm to ask if dev are willing to do something about thisif they are working on it but didnt find a solution or if they wont change it at all never3  true for sure launchpad cost a lot of cpu and for processoronly planets we can have a use for storage as not enough cpu left on some case but with the current value on storage cargo and the time between each move these have really small utility like silo coupling arraysome tweaking on the numbers will be a good thing
bumping this here
this is covered under commit to excellence proposal i believe
yah well i dont really have faith in ccp not ignoring one proposal because it insults their ego
supported logistics range on t3s needs an increase to make it practical
i love the idear of scanning wrecks with combat probesthe issue i have is people scanning wrecks to get to the mission runners insidenote im not a mission runneri think that wrecks should become scannable after the site witch they are in has despawned they would have a low sig radious to ensure that they are not insta scanned on top of that the sig radious could increas with the number of wrecks with in a 500km radious of the sentral most wreck thus making abandoned mission sites easyer to scan than lone wrecks
i agree wrecks in an active deadspace should remain unscannable until the deadspace area is completed and despawns if the mission runner wants to lay claim to the wrecks for salvage they need to keep the mission area activeas for increased signature per amount of wrecks in the area or separate signal strengths for different class wrecks no way thats where the random aspect is area could have 1 frigate wreck or 50 battleship wrecks
pods are different currently podding across a few systems to pick up a new ship for example is relatively safe in highsec since there isnt really any benefit to shooting one of those pods simply because there is nothing of any value in one with this suggestion the corpse would become a high value item and system jumping in your pod would nearly equate to a suicide missionhave you ever pirated personally my pirate account not this one makes a decent living using ransoms and i know quite a few others who do too your lol is just plain childishhow many players do you know who destroy their own ships cheap or not for salvage it isnt worth it and where in my post do you see me saying anything about putting imps in an alt to destroy it although installing the free cheap ones given in the tutorials would be a viable use the op suggested using the biomass to sell for cloning even if there are no implants so every corpse would be profitable whether they had implants or not
wow so you would buy a set of 5 implants and then pod yourself its like a ship the salvage from a ship dosnt in anyway even come close to the value of ur ship i doubt ppul will pod for fun in highsec i mean i have podded ppul with 7 implants for fun but thats just for lolz p wow and the biomass would be very minmal like the cost of oxygen and you wouldnt get more then a few units so you would need tons of corpses just to get enuff biomass to make a new clone
killing pods is pretty good fun anyway i think the idea of looting the corpse afterwards is amusing in a macabre way although how much of a body is going to be left after it has been hit by a 720mm artillery shell is open to questionthe main argument against salvaging corpses is that it would significantly increase the implant supply whilst im not against that in principle the effects should be considered first
supported with the provision that harvesting implants is a criminal activity and that partaking in this industry will likely make you an outlawi made a similar proposal a while back where harvesting implants were used to make learning booster drugs
dude there is no need for such a thing though it is admittedly convenient just simply create a safe spot near but not too close to a celestial if youre somewhere else in the system align to that celestial and whala instawarp as for whs thats different
have you ever found yourself turning on the television or loading up another game while you are playing eve i have it seems that every time i play eve i must load up something else on the background to entertain myself during the long and unnecessary waiting timestherefore i propose that the following should be implementeda reduce session change timer to 10 seconds or lessb increase warp acceleration speed and possibly increase warp speedthese small changes will not impact the balance of the game very much and they would increase player enjoyment by quite a bitedit me anticipates getting flak about the increasing warp speed as it will kill solo pvp  if you are with the faster warp kills solo pvp crowd please indicate if you agree with a at least
im all in favour of shorter session change timers  i cant imagine there is anyone who wouldnt be and id support your proposal if it were only for this changefaster warp speeds have significant gameplay implications and i think youd be better off putting that as a seperate proposal
changing gameplay is a necessity no matter what the proposal isas benign as the reduce session change timer suggestion is it is still going to be a significant change to the station campers crowd if it is reduced to 10 seconds or even 5 seconds reshipping will only take 1020 seconds instead of the full minute as it was before which was enough time to deaggress and gtfothe point here is not whether or not it changes gameplay for some but rather would it benefit the game as a whole i think it will who really wants to spend 30 seconds to wait for the session change timer who really wants to spend 30 seconds in warp doing nothing right now it makes for a bad game experience as most people just do something else during these boring transition phaseswhen we were new these transitions are easier to accept since there were a feeling of wow im in a spaceship feeling when we just started the game we tend to inspect our ship and the environment and be impressed by the graphics but these things have became stale now that weve done them a thousand times imagine what would happen if incarna comes out and you have to sit through the transition scene approx 30 seconds every time you exit your ship everyone would be up in arms about it also supporting my own topic
i could code it all in about 5 minutes i mean just copy paste the script from the actual game clock then done
i unsubscribed with 23 days or so left to play it told me it will unsub me when my natural playtime has finished this is ridiculous why cant they unsub me now and freeze my account with 23 days saved until i sub again whats happening is ccp effectively robbing me of my subscription money that i do not use mine is a simple case what shall happen when someone with 11 months left on his subscription decide to quit thats a good 165 bucks enough to feed a third world family for half a yeari have already unsubscribed the fact that i can still sit here and write this thread prove that it doesnt actually unsub me i do no wish a refund but i would like to have my remaining play time saved and the game immediately unsubscribe me by the next down time when i sub back i can use that playtime again
i suspect it has something to do with the fact that you could use those 23 days to train instead of the old and dearly missed ghost trainingwhy not just set a 23day skill and reallydoes anyone use the 12month sub if they dont plan on using it the correct answer is no
no that was the contract you agreed uponno that is effectively allowing you to rob yourself of said playtime that is not ccps issue if you want to you can rob yourself of all the playtime you likewhich player is stupid enough to make a contract for 12 months unless he really wants to play for that time doesnt matter anyway he is still able to keep skilling even if he doesnt playalso enough to buy drugs for one weekend to feed yourself in a 2 star restaurant with a single dinner and a bottle of wine for one evening enough for putting your hands on the boobs an expensive prostitute for one minute your point beingunfortunately for you that is not the contract you agreed on
i actually agree with the op but heshe said it in a very assy and i want my way wahhhh tonetechnically when you signed up you also signed a contract like the above poster said a non refundable subscription payment i dont see whats so hard to understand about that so no need to get all angsty about iton a lighter note i do somewhat support changing the system so that youre able to freeze your account to save game time in case youre going away on holiday or something maybe have the option to freeze for at least 30 days to prevent abuse though the fact that you could always have a skill training in that time thanks to the passive training that kinda defeats the purpose
then you die for your own stupidity darwin and so oni am with korvin here the tools exist use them
thisand for missions you should be running missions for opposing factions alternately and turning down faction kill missions like every other missioner is doingfor fw you joined it youre kos should be more worried about opposing fw ppl instead of npc faction police anyway
it already does you can add whole regions to the avoid list
yes please as you get on in experance and years you find the selection a bit slim when buyingbuildingprepairing ships for what evertheres more then 1 ship in the t1 catagory but destroyers you think expecialy for caldari they would have a missile destroyer instead of just 90 gun onebattle cruiser wise meh i donno i cant think of a reason why youd need moret3 i agree you introduced it and if we discovered something like this in rl wed make every class including mining class t3 shipsmore faction sure wheres the faction mining ships other then the ore orca and rorqual which cant even mine unless using drones as far as other ships id like to see faction destroyers and battle cruisersnot sure what jove is but why notpersonal suggection new race  whole line of ships maybe one that uses weapons like microwave or radio guns hey its not the best idea but at least im trying
spaceships
yulai  this is a breaking news story scope news has learned that an armada of unknown origin has jumped into the yulai system concord and ded warships have been scrambled to intercept we will continue to provide coverage of these events as they unfoldwhat do u think of scope news not meaning anything ingame for the most partyes its a good read but in the end its for noyhing than ur imagination which sucksbs i saycould have been made a ingame mission like i said beforety ccp
you must be joking these events resulted in an entire concord station being crushed and the war between the empires to start ever heard of faction warplease do your research and dont use the article by the scope thats had one of the biggest impacts on the game to this date as an example of how little impact they have seriouslyeditcheck out this trailer which is actually about this exact event
i saw that vid so ur saying that a station got blown up also tell me one person involved in a battle with concord did u see or engage the amada of onknown origin were npcs battleing it out or was it players in their respective factions fighting as usualconcord and ded warships have been scrambled to intercept did any1 see this happen its all make believe and worthless faction warfare is always happening ingame this scope bs doesnt just like that gallente supercarrier crashing into that station or the amarr empress havein that big meeting it never happened ingame
that stuff happened back during a downtime yes several stations were incapacitated and to this day still show the physical signs of an attack more recently sansha fleets have been engaging players yes actual ingame events players can joinscope news is a good thing keeps the gamemoving
i was never in favor of creating the csm to begin with player councils in mmos end up being nothing but pr tools to make players think they have inputas csm5 proves we have no input our csm representatives have no input there isnt anything ccp is doing that either we or the csm can change they are out to do dust514 and incarnaccps 20102011 development strategy can be called damn the bugs full speed ahead
exactly the money ccp spends on expenses flying the csm to iceland and providing them room and board twice a year probably could get us another developerif that developer does nothing but read bug reports and gets them into the queue to be fixed he or she would be achieving more than the csm doesnow this isnt a knock on csm5 i think for the first time a csm went to iceland and actually tried to do something good the fact that ccp basically told them to suck wind and wait until never proved that it doesnt matter who we elect or what they say if what we want doesnt match what ccp plans to do we lose we have no influenceit will probably take subscriber cancellations on the level that matches the swg nge debacle to get ccp to move teams from incarna and dust to fixing bugs in the stuff they released in the last two expansions
you guys thanks for the kind words tbh im not really gleeful about ccp being put in a tough position but the csm is pleased to see the problems and challenges faced by csm well and truly out in the open hopefully good changes will come out of itboth in the game and in the processthere are glimmers of hope
regardless of how well any sitting csm has performed the system itself does not work and is a waste of resources it needs to be disbanded asap
csm is there to get answers for the players they clearly have so they have been doing their job ccps job is to provide a game people enjoy playing players armed with the knowledge obtained by the csm can make informed choices
i was expecting great things from mynxee and as usual she has delivereda special thanks to all the sitting csm members great job in pressing the issues i dont know about the rest of you but i was amazed when i read the minutes especially the summeriesagain great jobps  no word on towelstribe
as a person who has driven efforts to bring two large software organizations into iso and other quality framework compliance i can say from direct experience it would be a waste of resources it would require allocation of substantial resources to meet compliance requirements and would distract ccp from focusing on getting eve improved even if they did manage to find a way to get certified there is nothing that would change what they choose to focus on going forward lots of companies that embrace iso still make horrible productswhat ccp needs to do is make some hard choices and create a plan that addresses the horrible problems their legacy code creates even if that means essentially creating what amounts to eve iiin the end as long as enough folks are playing to keep eve in the black we can expect ccp to keep doing what theyve done till now which is work on whatever they are most interested in at the moment even if that means leaving a lot of existing stuff unfinished or broken no reason to expect that to change since other than some forum griping that has been a successful business model so farissler
ccp does no longer work under the waterfall modell they are using scrum now
you know thats how new games get made right you take the profits from the old ones and pay devs with it jesus dont be stupidi dont really agree with ccps plans for eve atm but suggesting that youre some sort of shareholder and have a say in how they spend the dough is ridiculous
broken and bugged as eve may be there still isnt any better mmo that i can find so the op can make his loud im leaving claim and i will dutifully ask can i has your stuff
congrats to all the csm great attempt at it i hope like all the the other players hope that ccp takes a step back looks at the issues and thinks about what they are doing and where the game is going mynxee your doing great keep it up sokratesz i know you get alot of hate but keep it up at least you mynxee and now mazzilliu are doing your best to keep us in the loop thanks for the hard work and keep it up
excellent idea
concord has its place  leave it in thereinsurence payouts for all has its place  leave it theresuicide ganking has its place  leave it theremake kill rights sellable that will fix the problem and i am pretty much sure all parties will be happybounty hunters get to hunt down players in high sec miners get their revenge by selling kill rights to get money back and see the offending party killed pirates get to pirateimagine hulkageddon 4 with sellable kill rights ohh the carnage and the funand by bounty hunters i mean vigilantes who dont do it for the money they do it for the justice
this we need a workable bounty system and god knows theyve been proposed enough times the current system badly distorts the balance in high sec
supported keep hope alive
its time
signed
total agreement you cant expand if what u have doesnt work stop the sidelines ambulationconsol fps and instead of trying to recruit new gamers fix the game for those who actually spend money to play it now apart from anything else what is going to happen if all these new things have their desired effect and suddenly we have peaks of 75k or even 100k eve lag happens now at 50kccp fix your first game before you start loosing your core player base
bumping this incredibly important proposal come on ccp work with us please
yes it is always fail when ccp announces something then it comes time to deliver and we get some watered down pos that does crap half of what it was supposed to do and has lots of problemsbugs ps 5 minute time delay is so overdue to be gone gee ccp still couldnt get anyone to tackle that eh
please
what he said
as someone who has screwed up and accidentally repackaged courier packages i definitely support this
rf freight seems to not only deliver good services but also good suggestionssigned
supported trying to say titans and moms are in the same weight class is just hilarious
explain to me how 5 of those hyperions can fit in that assault carrier too while your at it
supportedcapital ships should be exactly that capitalmake them at least twice as big as the biggest battleship or 3 times as bigive yet to see a titan around but if im flying a frigate i want to be able to have to take the time to fly from the stern to the prow as an added funny note can we have a sticker ont he back of titans saying we brake for nobody 
this capitals and supercaps need to be imposing presences on the battlefield not ooh look at the slightlylarger battleship and its stupid little dromaigawdgetemoffme though the latter situation is pretty funny
booya
i for one support this thread with the power ccp vested in me through the small little thumb below my portraitthe scale is off the whack not only are motherships not dockable whilst they are not larger than dreadnoughts we are supposed to believe that battleships with the size of a carrier are supposed to fit into it and that hundreds of carriers are able to fit into such small stationsthe only ships which are to scale at this time are the capital industrials and titans
supported you dont put 910 bill into a ship that is still the size of a battleshipit is another ridiculous problem that can be fixed in this game without little effort
this is a good idea i am support it
this is a good idea i am also support
umpa bumpa
i agree with most of the points  ill have to make it into an issue one of these days 
tamber told me to do it

proposing this againprevious threadlinkagecurrently you can change your characters face i would like the option to change the character name could charge a fee could be part of buying a character could be freei feel it would be nice for someone who bought a character to change the characters identity thus remove former associations which could be positive or negativesomeone who wanted a specific character name that wasnt available at the time of creation is now available biomass processinganyone who would change the picture of their character would surely be interested in changing the namean argumentlets say for instance i infiltrate your corporation then gain your trust and you give me access to something that is valuable i steal it now you want revenge you hire mercs post tearful threads about how you were wronged and try to make things difficult for me now with this proposal i change my name without this proposal i can create a new character on my account sell the evil get it character and buy a new character or wait a few week before i try to do it againso as you can see it isnt difficult for me to do right now today sure this will be another option but if this is the reason for not supporting this proposal you need to find a new game anyway because it will happen to you or someone you know or your entire alliance was the buddy list an intended intel tool like localif this was tied to the character name rather than some other value associated with the character it could be a problem easy fix would be require that the character doesnt have any kill rightssurely characters are tracked using some type of unique character identifier not the character name anything character specific that must be tracked employment kill rights ect could be tied to that rather than the name of the character

imagine you are a small alliance youre right nearby empire you want to pay a very large fee for concord to come to your space and secure it to a 05 level perhaps for 10bilmonthsystem you can secure it to be as good as highsec everyone is welcome to come and playthis would make roamers focus more on the nonsecured systems more fights this way in addition to people who treking to and from the secured systems
i just spoke to a concord representative about your proposal while he expressed interest in the idea of securing all known space under concord jurisdiction he claimed that with the sansha invasions hulkageddons aftermath and the spate of suicidegankings concord is simply too busy to consider your proposal they would be far more interested in securing systems that are already under an empires control as it is their stated mission to protect empire assets and space they do however welcome donations from concerned pod pilots such as yourself so if you are interested please send money to your local ded office thank you

great for pricing faction ships and modules i approve
only for contract only items
yes
definitely
make it so
supporting my own topic and raising awareness
agreed and supportedunlike others however i would not minding having the option to rclick and either show contracts as well as show market details but not in the same instance
do want
usefull indeedsupported
i like this idea something we always needed it should just default to all regions imo
i think this problem could get solved by the drones only taking aggro if you have an established link to them if the npcs dont aggro the drones floating in space then there is no chance of losing them

back up needed
the price of the pi is going way down anyway so a small change like this is only going to drop the price a little bit more of at all and at the same time heple everyone out alot and save a hell of time
look at all the haters hatin
gender change is a must race and bloodline however no i dont think sothis is not world of warcraft ccp does not sell themselves like s as blizzard doessupport for gender change only
i would support this only ifrig salvagingimplant salvaging skill would be a truly evil grind 10x rank or highereach level would award only a 2 chance of success for a 10 success rate at level va failed attempt to remove a rig from your ship would cause a huge explosion and severe ship damage possibly destroying other fitted rigs andor modules and eviction from the station for causing the explosion for 15 minutes aka jackass timera failed attempt to remove an implant from your brain would cause your instant gruesome death cue the biomass your character sound and you would then wake up minus all implants in your medical clonehow much are you willing to risk to pull out that 5 implant or t2 rig
you can save your implants just get a jump cloneeither naturally or with estel aradors help and preserve your old ones i still have my ancient 3 clone you can save your rigs  just sell the ship and buy a new one with the rigs you want this is completely unnecessary
this had already been posted in the ideas forum but i believe it this be here also here is a brief descdont forget to check the support box if you do
i created a similar request to give players a free the slaves option some months ago makes sense from a gameplay and a rp point of view to me
once again let us truly come for our people
this idea is terrible
wrong char
supported the extraordinarily high cpu cost of remote shield reps seriously gimps shieldtanking battleships even more than they already are to compensate i suggest upping the pg cost so that spidertanking drake gangs dont become totally overpowered
actually they would if you cant understand why then you should probably stop posting till you do
please note as of this post i have changed the title of this thread for clarity my point is still the same so i have not put a new topic up i just changed the title so my issue was more apparent
agreed i dont want internet spaceships second life and if we were to have dust it should have been for storming stationsso avatar worth having no  but what might be worth knowing is what will avatars bring to game play and game play seems to be getting lost at the moment
i dont think we realy have a choise here none of us need avatars or fps becouse we are already eve playersi can see ccps needs to do this things though they are doing ground braking work in something that has never before been donei am willing to sacrifice a few years for that besides they are still working on eve at the same time too
thisto much whining about ccp
supporting because i want the game fixed and dont think a stupid console game should hold up fixing a game that is out alreadythat is all
more games  more penniesincarna is a pretty huge feature to add to eve and will attract more subscriptions people who dont want it wont use itincarna and dust are both related to eve if anything see it as a sign they want to continue development of eve for a long time
i had the idea when changing moduals on my shipplanet collens suffer some huge issues with power grid and cpu when their fully set up and its difficult with out deleting pieces and buying new ones to get them to balance out in productionoutputso heres my idea allow people to turn structures or links off and on like we can moduals with out removing them from the planet when offline they draw say 99 less pg and cpu and cannot be used for anything if a building is offline you cannot route resources though it if a link is offline same story
water why not liquid nitrogen insted
liquid nitrogen while it is very cold its ability to absorb heat is pretty limitedin addition it also makes metals very brittle and makes them break easily
i dont like people in militia who just do missions and do not shoot enemiesi propose you to change loyalty points reward of fw missions by adding pvp multiplier based on yours pvp successhow it works kill more enemies and grow your multiplier the higher multiplier means that an agent will give you more loyalty points if you dont like pvp the reward will be lower
come on seriously theres a much easier fivestep solution to this problem that you can implement yourself right now1 join fw2 find missionrunners since their missions appear on the overview3 pvp4 5 profit
are you offering me to kill my militia membersit is unacceptable
on the other hand theyll never see it coming making your job easier
this is not a bad idea militia should be an army not a bunch of carebears
i fully support this idea the primaes looks are just too cool not to have it around moreall three ideas are good ones since theres not ships that really fill that nice that each idea adresses
the primae looks really cool yet it is completely and absolutely useless not even a total 0 day noob character could make any real use of it as even the worst industrial is much better more flexible and even included for free in the tutorials there is no reason whatsoever to fly the primae what a wastewhatever is done to this ship to make it better and a more regular sight in space is a good thingnot doing anything would be a waste of good modelling and texture workthe ships background story dictates that there has to be a regular built salvage variant of it seed it
i am totally on board with making the ship useful its a one of the best looking ships in the gameanother idea is have a variant that allows you to have a more direct connection with the base planet side maybe you can do a direct link to it if you are in orbit and it would allow materials to go straight from the command center to the ship itself also moar cargo space pleasebut other than that i like the idea of making it a dedicated salvage or gas ship
yes this and having a dedicated gas harvster would be nice somthing that rips through gas clouds like a hulk rips through rocks
ccp have made a great game and put a lot of work into keeping it interesting for the vets and so that the n00bs can start all the while keeping it as balanced as they can you must have enjoyed it once or you are just complaining for no reasonif you dont think ccp is working hard enought to fix the problems vote with your feet it is easy to do if your fed idea of fun is playing a game you dont enjoy go play and whine about wow dont constantly complain about the hard work of the people who make a game i lovethere are issues but i am sure ccp is working hard to fix them and not just because it is their job i belive that the people at ccp want us to enjoy eve and not just so we keep subscibinggood job ccp keep up the hard worktldr stfu ccp are greatyes its an alt dont feel like being podded for supporting ccp again
personally i think that ccp does a bad job with community interaction thats why im not supporting this threadto many half finished features faction warfare territority has no meaning certificates how about inner corp accessto many well known bugs using logistics in higsec on foreign player is suicide hangar access is beyond fixingit would be easy to add 100 issues but thats not relevant for the current topicmaybe i should open a tumb down proposal threadactually im close to cancel my annual sub because the last 2 expansions where a waste of time in my opinion and projects like dust are not in my interest i dont intend to buy a consolei am well aware that some players are unable to respect my opinion but that is their problem and not mine
maybe its just me but i find the time restriction for posting extremely annoyingcouldnt we lower it to something like 2 min and still achieve the same goal
we have ccp employees and csms who have the time to go through and clean up the forums we have ccp employees who have time to make bets with the playerswhy dont you have time to respond to some of our proposals questions and concernsa little feedback in your own forums would be nice at the moment i feel as many players do that putting forth our ideas proposals and raising issues is a waste of time even the ones that get massive approval get no comment from you own customer service peopleim not asking for some person to sit and comment on the forums 247 but it would be a good idea from a customer relationship standpoint to have someone from ccp go through the forums once a day and comment ask for more info and acknowledge our input
because that goes against what the csm is player run
valuable request for csm to ccpive seen thread on this forum which where opened by ccp employees to gather opinions and feedbacks with 40 pages in them and no replies from ccpsupported
also have your ship keep track of the drones that you left behind so you can warp to them and scoop them something like the drones in distant space that for most ships has no use this idea is great

moar hotkeys my poor mouse is broken after a year playing eve1
gate guns ought to be removed and replaced with a concord faction navy which spawns and comes after you with similar dps as the gateguns and similar ewar as ud expectthat way the entire system gets some minimal protection the increased freedom on ship choice and such comes into it also
contrary to what some people say this would reduce the number of ships in camps for a good camp you need a rapier a lach and a hic this can be done with 1 scimitar as backup but if the scimi took sentry guns and got shot at the same time by a target it could go critiacal hence the need for a nother scimitar apart from that you can put in a keres to lock shuttles coming through however this requires another logistic ship only focusing on keeping that one frigate upif all this could be changed into a dramiel it would definately reduce the numbers in camps of course you would just see more small effective camps than normallyi dont really care if its one way or another just throwing my opinion out there
if anything the gate guns need to be boosted scramming camps is for 00 lowsec should at least be enterable barring the snipers who dont really have the ability to tackle at gatesif you want people in lowsec camping every gate 00 style is a bad idea it should be fairly easy to enter with the risk of being attacked while performing actions in system the security status penalty is completely ineffectual as most lowsec gankers live there solely and theres no npc intervention for them entering hisec
qft with some remarks thoin order to catch the smaller stuff in addition to the ships mentioned above you will need some serious remote sensor boosting ship 4 additionally anything larger then a bc would pose a significant threatwithout logistics ship 8 and 9to both the huginnrapier aswell as the lachesis in that context you will need some bs or bc dps ship 567added to that to make sure you are able to kill a bc or bs in a timely manner or try to ransom it whatever floats your boatin order for this not to become an howto gatecamp lectureon topic you guys really dont want frigs able to tank sentries in low sec travel would become much much more dangerous in testing weve been able to get an inty to have a scan res of over 6000 wanted over 9000 but hey and keep it alive with the help of logistics kinda ironic this coming from me of all pplin closing not supported
hi guys i just thought it might be a kewl idea if the full api could show the remainder of time left on your accounts subscription this way a program like eve mon could give you a message saying blah blah has 2 days left of playtime just so instead of spending my last few  on nachos i can spend it on game timeits fine if you only have 1 account but when you run 2x 3x or 4x you kind of loose track of when you last payedfoxz
there are sometimes legitimate reasons to give a full api key to another player to give information that is currently part of the full api some people might not want billing information to be part of the full api and knowing the subscription interval and expiration date is part of the billing informationso while this would be a useful feature for ones own information ill have to say not supported for the above reason
confirming eve has gotten so bad people dont even want to log in unless they have a skill finishing
some one set their drones on you didnt theypoor youps sounds to much like a smart bomb

dv note that your pi proposal is already part of the planetary interaction omnibus proposalshow a warning red pin icon if a pin does not have routes for its incoming andor outgoing productsi am perfectly happy to tweak the piop to include the blinking annunciator if there are no objections its a good idea and it makes sense to fold it in
i think dust514 will be ccps ngethey are completely wasting their efforts on it for one thing the concept of a console mmo has never been proven it is silly to not at least offer a pc client and it is clearly taking effort away from the existing and successful eve game i am not against incarna as it is an expansion of eve but i think that dust514 unless conceptually changed into an addition to the pc based game should gobesides console kidz who want to play mmos probably have a pc and play wow anyway
aww sometimes i wish my alliance devd the game cause ccp is getting much more emo tears than we are recently i didnt see in the notes that ccp said they were going to do nothing to eve in the next 18 months this seemed to be only related to losecon the contrary they also said that some things were coming in the winter expansion now i know that iceland has freaky day and night cycles but i am sure their winter isnt another 18 months ago either so we will still be seeing things coming upa lot of people like to complain like silly little spoilt brats however you cant make everything better for everyone and what they wanti have had some ups and downs recently but even with that and nearly quitting eve myself i have found myself coming back to the same things in here that i have always loved this game for and that is to do what i want and as long as i have that freedom in the game i will embrace changes rather than cry about things i never hadif i would buy a new tv after considering it i would be someone who would write a crappy letter to the manufacturer to give me new stuff what i think i should have had with it you pay for what you getif you dont like what you get or see it is still your right to cancel and leave the gamei would even like to see any other game developer who brings such a commitment to their game and especially to their players as ccp does and yes i have been to two fanfests in the past and also had the pleasure of meeting some of the guys while thereccp also needs to consider how to expand their business and i think it is great of them to do this within a universe they have created instead of completely ignoring this world they built and do something completely different this alone is a sign of loyalty to eve and its futureif more devs are needed to do it then fair play and that their decision i highly doubt they are going to start ignoring what they have made and achieved so far and also completely ignore the fact that they need to expand their business cause a minute few seem to not understand thati could go on but tbh i cant be bothered because i am now going to leave the office go home and logon to eve and enjoy some time with friends in a game i like and love
ccp will only be allowed to support dust 514 for 18 months for xbox live due to their software agreement
i would not want to be a csm member they are in a position with the current mechanics of how it really works vs how they are told by ccp and the player base on how it should work are vastly differentno matter how ambitious or hopeful you are when you take a csm seat you quickly realize have little say you have in anything stake holder ha the definition of what it is vs how ccp uses it is very differentccp basically says that csm has a say but the actions from ccp speak for themselves the csm has zero power over anythingso what do the csm members do then if they have no say in anything then what do a song and dance and try to make it look like they are making a difference that or use information and to use it for personal gain breaking the dna thus overshadowing and tarnishing all effort on the song and dance that the rest of the csm was doingall in all it is still 100 whatever ccp wants even though they say that is not the case i wonder if incarna and dust 514 will have a csm too
im a poor poor csm member and i dont know how i got into this predicamentcsm was always an advisory position anyways we arent game designers ccp can take our word or not and it looks like theyre increasingly taking our input on things which is pretty cool in my opinion anyways if they intended it to be a sham in the first place they wouldnt give us any more perks than they give isd volunteers and they wouldnt spend all that money flying us around to places9 people x 9 plane tickets x 9 separate hotel rooms x 8 days x time spent by at least 2 ccp employees to manage the csmeven if ccp never listens to a word we say we still win because we get free trips to iceland and a year of gametime if it werent for the csm i will probably never go to fanfestnow mynxee is gonna all get on my case because i said free trips to iceland im gonna run from this thread now
bottom line is ccp will say all they can to make the csm sound like it is more than what it really is that it is a pr move after the t20 incidentcsm will make it sound like they are making a huge difference when they really dont matter at all this is to have the feeling of elitism and to try and justify all the perks like free trips free game time etc that come with being a csmi for one would rather see all that money spent on the csm spent on hiring more devs to work on the broken parts of this game even if it means only one dev working part time it would be infinitely better for the game that what little csm has accomplished
obviously they are in a nowin situation for the first time imho a csm went to iceland and actually tried to do something constructive rather than engaging in power bloc politics or narcissistic epeen stroking contests and tried to use their alleged new stakeholder status to ask ccp to fix what we have before adding more broken stuff to the gameccps answer was go get stuffedso yes we now know the csm can do absolutely nothing it is a complete farce and frankly the whole of csm5 should resign in protest this will create a firestorm in the gaming press that will probably also spill over into the mainstream mediaobviously ccp isnt going to listen to either the csm or common players so if anything is to happen external pressure will have to be employedwhat happened in iceland proves all of us who believed the csm was nothing more to ccp than a cheap pr move in the wake of the t20band of brothers corruption scandal were correct in saying so if ccp is serious they need to readjust their priorities and dedicate at least one team to working on the csms top 2 or 3 priorities
i wouldnt expect it to see more than a paragraph about it in any gaming publication such an event stands 0 chance of squeaking onto the mainstream especially with darth vader turning to bank robbery
all the money spent on the csm could not hire one full time devdo the math on that well they could hire them if the dev worked for what passes for minimum wage in some poorer us statesalso ccp cant convince someone to move to iceland so they can work part time thats silly
this thread belongs on page one not page 2
bumpagei sure hope ccp is listening and the chutzpah to follow through on some badly needed polish work

this seems like a very interesting concept eve is rife with corruption scams and realism to a degree and to say that being able to change your name is not feasible which realistically it is would be absurd ccp has done an excellent job at allowing real world scenarios to pollute new eden adding to the realism of the very serious internet spaceship realm allowing the ability to change a capsuleers name adds more dynamic to the game and provides more options for pilots in general as evil put it people buy new characters not everyone wants to drag the associates and issues of the previous owner yes it makes hijacking easier provides more difficulties with intel and tracking creates issues with kill rightswhich i believe evil pointed out an excellent method for addressing this issue but overall just adds to the depth of the game eve is not the easiest online game to begin with being complex in nature realistic why not add more to the realismfly safeproclus diadochuruke coordinatorvarion galacticown alliance
why this new topic especially since older ones were better proposals yes to ability to change character name but you lack a very important part in your proposal that would make most counter arguments useless you should be able to track characters by their old name and searching on their new name should also give which names the char used to have
only if it leaves a permanent link in the characters bio about how the character was formerly called without that it would be a much too easy way to avoid consequence
no if you cant do what you want to do which is take advantage of people trusting you by other means a few youve listed i dont see any reason to make it easier for you the vast majority of requests to change a character name is to escape their past the minority being changes for aesthetic reasons or i didnt spend any time thinking about my name or i dont like my name anymore which also works as an excuse to hide the i want to take advantage of people crowd it is your character you made the face you picked the name if you didnt likewant it forever you should have chosen something else or just sell it and get another characterthe revolving door of alts and characters for sale is a problem in this game not something that needs boosting
imo a name change should be allowed for 1 time only per char per account and what im thinking about here is people who buy characters off the forum and want the change it to something they like now if that person sells that char to someone else then the new owner has the option to also change the name to something they want
give up already your posts are so bad that they couldnt even count as trolls
likee especially on nonmarket traded items

the problem with having a forum with this topic is there are so many players on eve that could care less about the forums imo there should be some kind of poll at the home page of eveanyway i think a name change maybe only able to change it once during a specified amount of time after incarna after which you cannot change it would be a good idea there are soooooo many people who would love a name change myself included didnt know fleet commanders call out names alphabetically at the time  and perhaps it would be even more effective for ccp if it was a paid option like 10 to change your nameand why not have a past names part of the show info if you care enough to set standings or look at standings then you wouldnt be lazy enough to not press show info on someone you are trying to view now would youbesides if it was a paid option ccp would make a nice buck or two off of this supported
yeah force those achura bastards to stare at their ugly mug for eternitysrs
like how there is a t2 icon at top left perhaps there should be a meta icon with the meta lvl ex m4 at the top right with a black background and white text this would show for all items except factionofficer and t2
i had this idea and posted it when i was in the csm ideally it would help for pi allowing small bonuses based on scientists etc available the happier they were the more they were fed longlimb roes entertained by exotic dancers et al the more they would produce this would give purpose to the human cattle and allow us to train our own citizens to serve our needsthe way ccp implemented pi im not when or even if well ever see this come to light especially with the new plans of ccp outlined at the latest meeting minutes so even though its probably way on the back burner if even in the queue i support this measure
so we have one group thatying thatand another group telling me thatthat is very interesting indeedobviously both sides completely ingnore 4 pages woth of facts and numbers both sides demonstrate horrible lack of comprehention both sides give arguments like slot layhout and passive recharge which have nothing to do with the topick of fitting reqs sinse in five pages of discussion no comprehencive counterargument was produced this topick should be supported
skillloss penalties are just a bad idea you are losing about 4 days of skill training that you paid for and youll never recover them youre a jerk
yeah we got your opinion in the op unless you have something new to add stop repeating yourselfps maybe you should try wow i hear there are no real consequences for death there
all great things keeping the t3 industry runningexactly id support the removal of the penalty if t3 was nerfed but not in its current state
irrelevant sp loss is a bad mechanic since it so strongly discourages pvp
probably the single biggest reason why i wont support this proposaldont get me wrong i love my proteus i just dont want to see it become the standard for richman pvp when i get into it i fully accept the risk that i might die and have to retrain one of my t3 skills up a levelnot supported
not supportedreasonsfirst of all the sub skills are rank 1 second it is tech 3 shipi would understood if the sub skills did have a rank 3 or above
piratefaction cruisers battleships capital ships are all stronger than t3s lets have a skill loss penalty for dyeing in one of them to
fix the product we pay for better that than potentially 3 products that all need fixing
it seems like just yesterday that the forums were chock full of people whining and complaining that ambulation as we called it back then was never going to happen and people wanted to walk in stations and what the heck was ccp thinking why werent they doing this now that they are doing it we get a forum chock full of whining and complaining that fixes are never going to happen and people want fixes and what the heck is ccp thinking why arent they doing thisjust goes to show you cant make everyone happy
while i can see definately see your point and owuld love at least half of the compilation of minor ui improvements proposal implemented so in battle i dont have to zoom in on the enmy ship and stare at it trying to figure out if its uswing energy vamps on me these features have been promiced for a loooooooooong time by now and i can deinately see ccp whanting to finally get them done delivered and over with so they are no longer hanging on ccps back i personally will probably never play dust i simply will not by a console because of one game i just dont like consoles and how limited they are compared to a pc infact still whant the dust to be realeased and see how it wrks out and i will probably still enjoy hiring mercenaries to brow up pi installations of that ninja salvager that jacked my damsiel in distressi might toy around with walking in stations for a few weeks and forget about it but i can understand why ccp is doing this and so i will not support this proposal ps ccp listen to csm they are really speaking the truth
while i will admit that a game of this age should in theory not need a whole lot of dev time to just keep it running and fix bugs howmany games of this are are still being actibly developed with 2 expantions a yr the constant stream of newly added bugs sorry content means that its not just a case of running through the bugsbalance issuesso in answer to the tldr and even more confusing clarification no i dont give a crap about consol kids and tbh walking in stations is on paper a nice idea i cant get over the fact if im camping you in station i want you to be just as bored as i am not pretending to have a beer
i cant wait for custom clothes missions and hatsmy girlfriend is pretty good at fps and i cant wait for her to work for me i dont know what all the fuss is about the game works fine for me

do we really need tojan warnings for youtube google and some other legitimate sites
theres a trojan warning for linkbacks to this forum as well
xss issue in youtubeandattacks with trojans from legitimate websitesso no the warning should stay as its not the site linked to that warrants the warning its the fact its being linked
how about create some actual security for the game sell people rss tokens for ten bucks make a few hundred grand and cut down on isk sellingworked for wow
i got an idea while talking with my corp mates and some friends this idea if used properly will decrease the advantage macro miners have over legit people who have lifes jobs and so onthe first idea we had is a que much like the skill que but set it shorter say 2 to 4 hours max so you could que up 30 minute cycles 4 times for 2 hours running and not have to pay attention to it or 8 times for the 4 hours the reason i stoped at 4 is to keep the 5 hour cycles a valid option if you could que up 5 hours worth of 30 minute cycles you might as well throw 30 minutes out and boost the output of 5 23 and 96 cycles to matchthe second idea we had is more versitility when dealing with cycle times the idea we had was set up a slider bar simular to this30m1h2h3h4h5h6h12h24h48h96hthis would allow people to set up more customized timing and have the output of the extractors scaled30m  100 output1h  90 output2h  80 outputand so on
seems like a fair enough point to me would make my life alot easier
you already can turn off links by just deleting them they are easy enough to set back up
true but deleting links also deletes routing that goes though it my idea would be to shut off the links and facilities but keep routes set up so all you have to do is turn them on or off and theyd continue with out you having to reroute everything
i like this idea
add a coolant bay to all ships if cargo is a concern or just realize you need to balance ammocoolant materialnanite pastei like this ideas to improve the dynamics of solosmall gang combat are generally welcome in my book
use water a direct export from the pi materials dont add a coolant bay you have to balance it like cap boosters and ammo make the module use something like 1 unit of water per module per cycle for a crow with 3 launchers it would use 3 water every cycle make the module just keep heat from absorbing into the other modules and itself but the ship still gathers heat
right now the preview screen for all ships and their respective race is the basic caldari background you get on the thumbnail pictures my proposal is simple minmatar ships have minmatar backgrouns amarr have the amarr backgrounds etc
its a ship preview window not a background preview window
although this obviously isnt high priority this would be pretty easy to impliment
kind of a duh thing
make moon mining in wspace possiblealthough this could make wcorps more profitable than they are now this change would allow small corps to harvest some of the most exotic materials out there rather than the ebil 00 blob alliancesthis would shift some of the power and market monopolies of the powerbloc alliances that now hold the profitable moons which can heavily effect the moon mineral supply marketthis gives the small guy a greater chance of stumbling onto a valuable moon and making him into a moon mining tycoonobviously the moon minerals that can be found should scale with the class of the resident wormhole for example only the r64s can be found in class 56 and the crappier moon minerals are found in class 432 and 1 if at allit gives the smaller wcorps more of a chance because if you attack a valuable moon you wont likely have multiple titans and lag wars when it comes out of reinforced also the logistics of keeping a c56 pos up and running is far more involved than a 00 r64 within alliance controlled spaceedit this is somewhat of a way to manage moon mineral prices as well as when prices for a certain moon mineral spike more people head to wspace in order to find a moon bearing that mineral
in a way i do kind of like this ideai dont know how itd work for balance and if anything were implemented it had better be after the economy fluctuations from pi settle down but wspace is uniquely at an advantage in this area for the simple reason its almost impossible to hold multiple systemsthat said its already a difficult if not impossible proposition for more than one corporation to have a presence in a system between this and pi making it easier to refuel wspace poss i think that situation might be clinched utterly
i sort of think this would bring back true exploration as nearly all of the eve universe is mapped and catalogued whereas wspace is so shifting and changing even if there was a database similar to the moon map project for wspace getting to the systems with the good moons is gonna be a mission
why it would be nice i sure as hell dont whant to see nullsec allliences filling up all valuable moons in wh space wiht their towers in near absolute safety for themwhat i would like instead is for the resources to shift and change true to the nature of unknown space every resource would only last so long a week two weeks before it is depleted and another random resource would spawn on a random moon int he same system could be useless gas could be tecnetioum a system of such unpredictable natuere wouldprevent nullsec alliences from setting up shops there too muc organisational hassle but would reward small entities something of spawnfarm wait for next one nature
no it wouldnt it would just draw the mega alliances into wspace and i really dont care to see them there
pi in wspace makes only with moonmining any senceits just wrong that you can have a whole colony with all extra stuff but not some mining on a single moon with a station from space both or nothing should be allowed
i wonder why they didnt revamp moon mining to be more like pi not exactly the same of course but still something more dynamic
no he is simply suggesting you to go and take the pvp to the enemy mission runnersor your only way to be happy is to remove options from other players
i want to involve more people in pvp the higher missions reward is a good stimulus
while i agree it would be nice if we could get better rewards for pvp due to exploits i dont think they can boost it muchmany people appearently have alts in different militias they will just put them in insured t1 ships and blow them up for the lp
how would you measure pvp success do the people who have thousands of kills but got most of them in a logi or ewar ship count as being successful in pvp or are you going to do it by top damage dealer on the km in which case you push militia into using larger more expensive ships and unfairly penalize new people or those who cant afford to fly faction or t2 ships

not sure what you are signing but it looks like this thread was made in error
not suported you have compleatly missed the t2 rig market    they are the equivilent of ur proposal
supported never has a ship model been so wasted by being only a singlerun designspecifically in favour of option 3
eh ill support this one and stronglywhile the threads a bit on the extreme side and i recognise there are issues ive had it up to here with all the shrieking about the developers current plan especially the erroneous claims all spacebound content fixing and optimisation is completely and utterly on hold for 18 months and hope to god they continue to ignore itnot that they can pull back on it if you ask me incarna is too far along for it to be anything but a financial disaster to abort it and putting it on hold would only create more problems including at least one largely wasted development cycle from reassigning staff and resourcesfor one i do not want an eve where everything was fixed early because of screaming children instead of being a proper development focus as they plan on it being only for a masspile of expansions from incarna dust and the rest of planetary interaction to break everything all over again and possibly take another few years to get fixed due to resources already having been burned in a previous redundant fixscramble that might even do serious damage to eve way more than a year or sos continuation of the current state complete with the usual continuous tertiarypriority fixing along the way could do
i was looking for a list of csms and found this
new and or inexperienced players typically take less of an interest in the community and everything else that surrounds eve  so how are you going to get them to vote
i just think it would make the player representation more balanced if there was a younger representative in the csm  like a reserved employee chair in corporate boardsedit not sure how it could be implemented  perhaps the departing csm and ccp agree on 3 nominations
new players do not know about the csm veteran players do i work with new people all the time in eve this is from my candidate page for the last electioni have started a video training program to go along with this saves me the time of doing classes and people can re watch at leisurei actually got about 4060 fewer votes then i had expected this last election while presuing the newbie votean actual new player on the csm would be difficult eve is a deep game and new players have not waded far enough to know enough about the broader aspects a new player will not have enough reputation in eve to gain enough votes the csm is largely a popularity contest qualified people do make it in for the most part but good people are left out because they are not a crowd enough as stated the main constituency is unaware of the election so do notcan not vote for the newbiethere are some other points but i forgot them while typing just woke up and eating breakfast while typing thiswhile i am more focused on entry level pvp it exposes me to the newbie experience equally important is that i hear and have to come up with answers to what the newbies are dealing with you dont hand a 2 week old pilot a t2 fitted hac and say fly this you give them a meta 1 fitted cruiser or frig insteadi do think the csm and ccp is missing an important element without having me there any worthy csm candidate could say the same there are many people with the same agenda both at ccp and in the csm and my views are defiantly outliers that is a good thing to shake up the group think but group think is what gets people elected in the first place
absolutely not eve is one of the deepest games short of something like chess or go its got a famously steep learning curve and people can and do spend years learning about small subsets of the entire game experts in say fleet pvp arent generally experts in market manipulation and they arent generally experts in lowsec ganking and they arent generally experts in running a lvl 4 high mission running corp and they what benefit would it be to have a bunch of green players giving input directly to ccp we generally want people who are knowledgeable and experienced new players simply arent
by we i assume that you mean you just because you have many years experience in the game does not neccessarily make you better at it i have met quite a few veteran noobs in this game who has absolutely no clue about some of the newer featuresfurthermore having a csm representing the new generation capsuleers will not cut it  its like asking your grandmother to show up for a focus group in college i would like to see a 6 month  1 year old capsuleer on the csm  just my humble opinionedit check ccp zulus last paragraph in the dev blog  we obviously need to improve things on our side as well  it takes two to tango
no the eve community andor people who want quality representatives want to make sure that their reps are both knowledgeable and experienced of course it will experienced players know what tools a new player needs and what areas can use improvement new players dont even know what those areas are
re 1 i do believe im part of the community and i disagree on experience reminds me of the peter principle promoted to incompetencere 2 strongly disagree  what tools did you use x years ago what tools do new generation players need there is a related topic here
i said we in general youre allowed to want someone who cant possibly speak as an authority on any part of eve other than not knowing what theyre doing but that doesnt make them a good person to suggest anything to ccp and no new players today dont need anything all that specific you seem to have missed the point that now they even have a wiki when i started we only had the dramatically incomplete tutorial and we still learned how to play the game we dont need csm delegates whose contribution will be to talk about all the things they dont understand
i started this thread just because i was curious if it had been suggested and discussed before the responses i have seen confirms to me that we really need a couple of younger pilots on the csmbtw i rest my case the tutorials and career missions are excellent they give a good introduction to the general features in eve you should try the new advanced combat or exploration  just hit f12
there is slight chance i will not be able to participate on the meeting due to rl commitments i will give my best to attend the meeting but i want to apologize in advance if i dont make it
its interesting that people think my observation that ccp is abandoning eve  i am going to rage quit logic is not easily taught so i wont try other than to say that is a non sequitur as to the poster who said they are working on eve i think i quoted the part about the one small bit they are going to throw us i dont know what to make of it the subsequent dev blog by zulu basically verified that the vast majority if ccp resources will be spent on things other than spaceships i have heard the number of people they listed for dust only includes those interfacing with eveaccordinly there are many more employees than what was listed working on dust moreover i thought there was some other games ccp was working on beside dust incarna and eve again proving that the percentage of resources spent on eve spaceships is even tinier so i think the headline of this post is fairly well substantiated and no longer even controversial does that mean i will quit no they arent changing eve for the worse although i thought tyranis did indeed make the game slightly worse with cost of battlships and would prefer they untyranis eve that is relatively minor they just arent making it better either eve spaceships aint gonna change much in the next 2 years
if that is the case assuming what you say is true then spending even one dollar more on its development is asininethis does bring up a salient point with respect to console vs pc when you develop for console you are at the mercy and whim of the consoles manufacturer the pc is open to everyone so is the mac
if i understood correctly combat expansion is a combat ui update where ccp will improve the way battlerelated information is displayed so perhaps csm should get right on with what they whant to see included in that expansion how interface should be changed overloading direction dectors i would consider that important
yes what you suggest would be nice i agree since they didnt mention any ui changes in the discussion specifically about ui im thinking they meant something else that is why i ask what could they mean by thatim thinking it they might mean the maps will better indicate where ships are being blown up in surrounding areas which would be not so great but it could also mean they will revamp the tactical overlay  which could be very good whatever it is it is the only thing that seems to involve eve and unfortunately we dont know what it is im assuming its covered under the nda so csm cant talk about it
this is extremely unfair and biased statement as someone who was part of csm 2 3 5 and had close friend and ingame mate in csm 4 i can say that there was never any power bloc bull involved nor epeen crap i cant talk about csm 1 but it was never the case after
man im not sure if you guys at ccp are paying attention but it looks like your players dont care about incarna and dust as much as you hoped or doit almostalmost looks like they want your attention spent on other issuesi dont know ive been wrong beforebut i have a feeling about thisbut hey its your paycheck ruin it anyway you want
should it be pointed out that dust isnt being made for eve players i mean if eve players want to play with dust great if not fine its targeting a different demo on a different plateform incarna also will likely bring back old players that left eve because they anticpated wis much sooner and left eve in protest also if incaran is done right i think they are hoping to appeal more to a female audience which might increase their subscription base wod whenever it comes out wont be targeting anyone who is currently playing eve or dust at the time though it will be open to them it will be focused on creating a new marketplayer base for ccp if those products are successful dust and wod could doubletripple ccps revenue no game company can expect to survive off a single game forever the fact that ccp has survived on eve alone for so long is remarkable and ccp is smart to diversify while eve still has a robust subscriber base hopefully eve as at least as many years ahead as it does behind it but you dont hang your hat up on hope in business instead you make plans and create you own opportunities for growth and ccps best way to reach brand new customers is to develop new games to retain old customers of course they should continue balancing and they should fix bugs and keep interest in eve high by adding new content to it and tweaking current in game features and they do that as those things become available every patch is all about that and every major expansion has some patch like adjustments just because there is no major emphasis on it doesnt mean there isnt a team or two taksed with working on performancedebuggingexploitbalance issues someone at ccp is always working on those issues i think the whole csm minutes thing was miscommunicated and was misunderstood very badly and while the fallout might be a good kick in the ass for ccp to bump up some issues theyve qued up forever ago but a lot of bull is getting thrown in for good measure it would be bad for everyone if every bad idea that appears on these forums stuck to this issue as needed improvements to lowsecnullsec etc ps if you want to know what devs are saying and paying attention to use the dev finder featuer on this website and you will get shortcut links to all of their forum posts
thats a very reasonable point but it should also be remembered that dust isnt making them any money investing income from eve to develop other everelated games is fine its a good basic strategy and i think ccp are smart to do itbut neglecting the source of their income  and tarnishing the core game on which these others depend  yeah not so smart mmos are about investment the player invests his time effort and emotional energy in to the game because mmos reward that threaten that investment by neglecting bugs that compromise gameplay and leave players with the perception that things will only get worse and what do you have a ui that makes us all nostalgic for windows for workgroups and a rts miningame with npc ai that would make the guys who programmed doom go meh make no mistake dusts success absolutely depends on eve continuing to thrive if ccp refocus on polishing eve then im mildly optimistic about dust i dont think it will ever really challenge halo or the other toptier games but it could give ccp a steady second income without cannibalizing their existing players i know ccp said that dust can work without eve but take away the eve connection and what do you have left just another late to the party console shooter that has to compete against the likes of halokind which has an annual advertising budget equal to about 3 years of ccps turnover and a huge established playerbase
a post of excellence right thereis ccp striving to become like blizzard make games for cash and not for players but wait  blizz doesnt release half baked stuffi have many concerns about the game and currently the only thing that keeps me playing are awesome people ive met in the gamemy main concern is the ui as this is where the interaction with the game starts it is trurly dreadful  worst ui of all games of all time you should get a award for the dreadful ui of yours ccpfirst of all the dreaded clicking redesign it so that more than half of the commands can be issued from the keyboard do you want mass rsi epidemic whos gonna play the game then ergonomy is on its ass and crying lack of customization whatsoever why cannot we place whatever we want wherever we want its like using windows 10 while the current standard is linux with compiz or the like why cant i remove the toolbar from the left or place it on top bottom or the left side why cannot you implement a feature that displays everyone whos jamming me and what kind of stuff is coming at me why cant i place my targets like on the sides or totally redesign module placementi mean cmoooooooooooooooon there is so much wrong with the ui only that i dont know where to startccp no sweet pr bull nor honey glazed marketing talk will blind your players your playersbase is not stupid and you will start losing them if you dont stop fake sugar icing and start fixing the game according to our feedbackmore to come dierdra vaal i salute youfull support

if youre talking about pi clicking you may have a point that it could use some hotkeys etc but the game i play lets me avoid clicking in terms of activitating mods on my ship you can even set some drone commands onto hotkeys though this part could be improved you can even control ship speed using hotkeys though i dont think you can change directions using them currently and i get to see whats coming after me on my overview because i see if they are using a scam or disruptor or ecm or dampner or vamp or nuet its there in the overview if youre not seeing that your playing eve wrong d i do wish theyd allow camera control for the dir keys this would be great for precise directional scanning and a method to hit the scan without clicking and they could use secondary number keys for changing direction by artificially double clicking the related corner of the screen for you so your point is not without merit but eve has such a massively open interface that you cant absoultely hotkey everything and allow ppl to still talk trash in local ive actually done some work on control mapping before to suit my own expectations for other games with ty controls and from that hobbylevel learning experience im pretty sure you would have to instance the market and assets and all that other crap instead of intergrating them ontop of the primary ui if players want a hot key for absolutely every possible command in the game and im not sure players would like that option any better than the current one since multitasking is a regularity in eve
supportedi want my space ship game to work properly i dont give a rats about the planets
ccp need to absolutely take a step back and look at things dominion was a flop  there has been very little 00 space changing hands since dominion was releasedthere has been no alliance sprawl reduction which was a key goaltreaties were not introduced which are a critical componentthe promised continuous improvements to the system are not happening that isnt excellence to me regardless of the number of resources allocated faction warfare lowsec and fixing the problems in 00 once and for all should be 3 high priorities of ccp yet we dont see them prioritized at all

i support have my sp put in my swiss bank account
umpa bumpa
let me rewrite the possible rules that could be implemented   it can be done only once per account to help those who realy need it that way it cant be farmed you can buy back up to 1 year worth of game time maximum so an old character woudnt be a possible monster the number of sp available is based on the average sp per month the character chosen has trained if an old toon just played 2 months the average sp he did in those 2 first months are quite low so even if he decide to buy a year back it wont mean alot of spand i could add a new rule  the process cant be done on a transfered character characters have to be created from scratch in the account to be eligiblewith all these rules and ccp could add even more it will target those who realy need it and with the features already available in eve this is just another one in the same leagueresumUFFFD  whats the difference between paying now or paying the same later  ps  to those that post after this if you dont support this idea be sure to read everything that was said before posting thx
hey your first thread went wrong you should defintiely have reposted the idea so you can get the same responsesollution that doesnt take any more of the extremely poorly spent dev timedont buy alts with dumb names dont make alts with dumb names
actually the first one went 9 pages other than all of the moaning from players whove been scammed and seem to think their vendetta against the player actually affects hisher game play it was successfulthere have been topics voted on by the csm that had many fewer supporters and much more moaninghow many of you are the same players who desire realism in your internet spaceship game well it isnt that difficult to do in the us illegal yes but difficult not as hard as some would have you believe if you want realism allow only outlaws to change their name if you dont want people to change their name everyday set a timer to allow players to change their name every 6 months the potential revenue for ccp it makes me wonder why theyve not done this alreadyreally i dont think we should be deciding what restrictions or how it should be implemented im just requesting that it get some dev time proposing the idea of changing your character name let them decide the proper way and restrictions thats what they get paid to do
i click on threads posted by jason edwards because i know its a troll this particular thread is so bad its actually pretty funny
i say if thats a good idea then corps should be able to buy empire space or take it
that actually sounds very impractical 00 alliances have much more important things to do with their isk than waste it on help for concord
there are plenty of mercenary corporations noir for example who would be happy to provide this service for youthe troll is dead
infact thats another idea i have posted we should start moving highsec stations toward being player owned and thusly system owned
imagine a ship which is able to set a hologram on itself which makes you look 100 like a rat its just that you do show up on local but not directionals at any time you can drop the hologram and start to attack the personwhile you are transformed however if you are only a frig your ship is as weak as what you pretend to bechain ratters beware
had this idea years ago but you see how far it wentessentially a modified cloak that uses a script to make the ship using it look like the scripted ship while its active the scripts are blank when purchased off of the market and the target vessel has to be scanned to imprint on the loaded script blank whereupon its used and cant be resoldthe vessel using the script still has all of its passive traits all the holocloak does is change what it looks like on overview transponder  em signature until it deactivates the cloak to attackso if you can scan a faction rat say like a dark blood raider itll be all the easier to sucker in the ratters 
and what happens should a ratter eventually lock and shoot your ship while youre cloaked should concord come to kill him or should he have the right to finish killing youregards lax
i support this idea being added to the list of things ccp will never get around to doing
sometimes i accidentally look for this option even though i know it doesnt exist
adding my support to this its so simple so elegant why didnt i think of thisdefinitely a very good idea
very good idea

ccp stubbornly refuses to stop breaking our beloved game they ignore a vastly popular and supported proposal to focus on excellence they devote the vast majority of their development resources to making eve into an avatarbased game seemingly oblivious of the fact that those of us who have played this game for years had lots of firstclass avatarbased games to choose from and we instead chose to play internet spaceships they give less weight to csm proposals than they do to the most harebrained scheme of their newest hire now theyre launching ccpsanctioned events ccp end your antisandbox unethical mentality you get paid to keep new eden running smoothly the game is for the players not for ccp the players overwhelmingly want you to focus on excellence focus on excellence events in new eden should be playerdriven not ccp driven its not all about you in fact its not about you at allif i were making a videogame i would be tempted for a moment at least to give myself ubercharacteristics or indestructible spaceships with massive dps i would be tempted to name the annual gathering of players fanfest as though my customers were somehow nothing more than a bunch of clueless fanbois i would be tempted to take advantage of moon goo exploits i would be tempted to invent t2 bpo lotteries so that i could have an ez mode passive income i would be tempted to give my alliance mates their titans back after they blow up or let them keep their accounts after they use hacks to gain decisive tactical advantage in combat i would be tempted to make the game all about me by hosting officially sanctioned stickied events instead of trying to promote the same event on my anonymous toon i would be tempted to copy other successful mmos instead of staying true to the spirit of the game that the current playerbase lovesthen id stop being a er and realize im getting paid to make eve a dark complex unforgiving sandbox game better for the players who directly or indirectly pay my salary and id get back to work fixing the game ive been busy breaking for the last few years

so stacking weapons reduces lag how about we stack ships we all know commandships are pretty useless relative to their training time so how about a fleet fuser ability that cs have that will fuse ships so im flying an eos and i fuse together say 5 megathrons to form uberthron they act as a single identity in terms of hp and ability to move around and such movement and such gets controlled by the eos firing of weapons and local mods get controlled by the individual shipsto the enemy its a single entity to shoot it has an eos for a head megathron body megathron arms and megathron legslimitationsyou cannot use jumpgates while stackedyour disco users will stay in space until they normally would disappear if they had been scrambled when they disco you lose the equivalent hp and everythingyour speed is the weakest links speed and no propulsion mods allowedno rr possibleyou take damage evenly and cant disassemble quicklyonly bscs allowedincreased mass somewhatshared cap could be a negative if most are newbshuge sig everything whoops u except titan dd if youre big enoughproslocal tanks and local buffers benefit everyonelag go bye byefleet leaders in cs get to control movement and warping100 megathrons are awesome cakesimmune to certain types of ewar essentially a supercapincreased mass makes bumping supercaps fun and easyshared cap could be a positive in that it makes neuting very hard essentially youre trying to neut the entire fleet at once
i think it would be op as when you did enough damg to kill one ship it would still be there in your plan but i ma new to the game so not sure if i am right  i mean if it was a 5 ship stack and i did 15 damg to his hp it should lose 15 of its dps or module output or what ever
posting in a jason edwards trollneedless to say bad idea is bad
lol  unkillable blob who need titans
good point how about an equivalent weapon hp pool so while overloading is possible your modules all take damage also while being attacked not evenly across all ships and thusly people would lose modules at random thusly if 20 of the armor is gone so is 20 the modules hp and 20 of the modules perhaps that would make overloading of modules on the stacked ships not very plausible in most circumstancessounds very interestingwell 100 bs vs titan wouldnt be all that manageable as it is titan is a different beast moreover we are talking about the blobs anyhow if the 100bs wasnt killable then ur not trying hard enough

i dont like the freeing them part but bringing the minmatar back to were the belong is a good idea also being a run away slave dose not make you a free citizens
a 30 day cycle on a moon would look like thisfor the first five days the ratio of the original mineral vs the new mineral goes down by 20 per day so if for example we mine a cadmium moon on day 1 it would be 80 cad and 20 tech then on day 2 the ratio goes down to 60 cad and 40 tech until on day 6 it reaches a 100 tech ratio the 100 tech would then last for 20 days on day 26 we would start to see a new mineral that was depleted somewhere else in the universe so for example your moon could produce 80 tech and 20 cobalthowever if at any point no mining is being done on the moon the cycle halts the moon has to be mined in order to get to the next element once a mineral is mined out it would respawn randomly to a new moon somewhere else so to summarizeexample moonday 0 100 cadmiumday 1 80 cadmium 20 technetiumday 2 60 cadmium 40 technetiumday 3 40 cadmium 60 technetiumday 4 20 cadmium 80 technetiumday 525 100 technetiumday 26 80 technetium 20 cobaltday 27 60 technetium 40 cobaltday 28 40 technetium 60 cobaltday 29 20 technetium 80 cobaltday 30 100 cobalt cycle starts againa form of dynamic moon mining like this would bring back moon probing as a profession and provide incentive to go after moons that show evidence of going from a so so element to the flavor of the month in demand element this would also give low sec dwellers a shot at having some decent income without having to challenge the larger moon holding groupssome of you will scream that the logistics of having to have a small low end moon mining operation to strip the crap away only to build a large death star to protect the high end stuff is too much work well no one said you had to put up a massive death star for that high end minerals and no one said you had to put up a small defenseless tower either how you go about trying to get out the resources is up to you you could go with a medium as a middle ground or maybe because it is at your home system a large death star is not needed because your fleet is the defense having small and medium size towers also helps give small to medium sized gangs something to pew at in case the defenders decide to run and hide from your roaming gangthe duration of cycles and such is debatable but ultimatly it is a balancing thing that is best left the the devs it does not seem to be terribly hard to implement please leave constructive feedback and help polish this idea into something that is best for the game

actually its a design flaw in the game mechanics that the op and his supporters are failing to take into accountnone of the vital ewar mods are low slots thus seriously threatening your tank if you were to properly fit them plus the cpu intensive mods of shields in general get in the way of the cpu intensive mods that are all ewar mods coupled with the fact that shield tanks have overall higher sigs and thus take higher damage from incoming fire means that no matter what you do the shield tanks will stay inferior and armor tanks will be usedwhy shield tank when you can armor tank and use up 6 mids for tackle and ewar why shield tank when you can speedsig tank with armor the list goes on and the arguments from the your dumb side are based on a larger view of game mechanics than the i want shield rr gangs naow damnit gang to really see shield tanked rr gangs around your going to need to see more changes than just some cpu issues but people seem to be ignoring this so we lower the cpu cost ill fit some extra  somewhere on my scimitaroh also for the scrub crowd thats crying about the lack of shield rr gangs they happen a lot if you took some time out of your rage posting and trolled some killboards youd see shield rr gangs just not battleshipswell thats the problem we want bs shield rr gangs cool field one and then sit and watch your huge siged bs gang get insta nuked by a load of bombers pro tip bombs are also sig dependent
5 mids is insufficient rrbs need a point andor sensorbooster andor eccm and or webscram that puts us at 78 mids i will just repeat here that the problem is not the fitting requirements of the modules but the shipsyoure an idiot skor and you dont listen look at the cpu requirements its like you wont even take a second and think about what you are saying and youre a big headed  you wont consider anything people like you ruin the game and any confidence in the csm next time we all might as well vote all goonsedit spelling
has no one ever heard of tacklers who honestly uses a bs to catch anything when you can have people flying t1 frigs and intys and do the job better fyi there are eccm low slot mods as well they just arent as good if changing cpu need to 0 wont increase the frequency of shield rr gangs what is the harm in lowering the fitting requirements by 50 or so obviously if 0 of current makes no difference then 50 of current will also make no differencethe reason of we shouldnt change something that is obviously broken because it wont make a difference in our fotm fleets isnt really viable warfare in eve changes from one fad to the next so often it baffles me as to why an option should be gimped because the mod to make it work takes up 20 of the available cpu on a bs meant to shield tankyet again shield recharge rate in the current call primary  melt  repeat style of combat is trivial when a fleet can literally alpha bcs your passive recharge means nothing i know of no bs passive shield tank that can sustain 2000 dpsdo i think shield tanking will ever become more powerful than armor tanking no the ships meant to shield tank have more issues then just fitting ability but that doesnt mean we shouldnt make the option available for those who want to try
excellent idea its been bugging me too oh and whoever states that bs will get too high signatures from fielding shield tanks should think again they are goddamn battleships they take full damage alreadyand sokratetz a perfectly good idea that was clarified extremely well on page one and youre trolling your own boards with completely irrelevant arguments that have nothing to do with rr like buhu buhu battleships use xl boosters goddamn illitirate git you shoudlnt sit on the council
imagine youre a small gang you the parasite jump into a system you tackle a guy in a belt you the parasite come to 0m and you attach onto the ship this gives your enemy extra shields extra armor extra structure you then share your collective hp and cap you become 1 ship you cant shoot each other you can shoot others any damage you take is taken collectivelyfurthermore so now your buddies are coming in hot his buddies are coming in hot you can use your collective cap and such to shoot at his friends your host can shoot your friends the key will be that you can jump off anytime you want the method of deparasiting can be using pos shields or docking
youre a genius
i support this proposal for capitals
if you think faction and pirate cruisers are stronger than t3 cruisers then you are doing something horribly horribly wrong

this is the only argument that makes any sence so far losing sp is bad i would love to see more of them t3s roaming the stars while isk is deffinetly an ussue with a price tag about 3 times higher then their t2 counterparts some of us richer folks are still able to afford them atleast from time to time but the loss of sp is just something that i cant really take as i do value my characters based on the sp number even high sp pilots 50 mil  have years long skilling plans in the end in my eyes it is a bad mechanic that prevens whileder use of thiese awesome shipsit should be atleast considered in the future itterations of the t3 ship designmechanics as in were still waiting on t3 frigs and bs

the multitude of this kinds of posts astound me and other dev blogs already address this issue you dont want all the artistgraphic standard programmer guys they hired to be working on the lag issues its not what they do you want the even more ubber smart genuis level programers that specialize in lag issue working on it if they put everyone on this issue including the interns and janitor there is a lot they wouldnt get done as a companyand the entire evecode would be corrupted by unspecialized inaptitude the best thing you can do is put the the best people for this job on it and let the people who do other things better do what they do best and this about timescales too much too fast theyve spent what like five or six years developing the incarna thing beyond closed doors been adapting it to consolebased fps called dust for the past 3 years and putting at least another year of polish on it before releasing it and are only doing conceptual level work on wod which may not come out for another 4 or 5 years from now all the while they have relentlessly added to eve twice a year since it began when i look back at what theyve done i see that they have paced themselves considerably on other projects while keeping eve their primary focus and their frequent comments direct responses to the community should show their level of commitment to this mmo remains strong personally i havent had much dissapointment with eves performance over the past 18 months so i dont know what all the groaning is about i live mostly in lowsec because i dont enjoy the tatics used in 00 to blob blobs with bigger blobs been there and done that my take away from that is once they make 5000 man fleets stable and lag free all you guys will be massing 6000 man fleets up just to keep it unstable and push the envelope of whats possible because many fcs in 00 seem to want to use lag as tatic especially when defending eventually iff ccp weeds out all serverside lag there is still going to be isp lag and as isps get better the bottlenecks arent in the server at all or the isp or even the clients code but in how many of your pilots actually have high performance pc rigs as opposed to low end compatiable ones lag is a multiissue problem and not just one thing and will never go away completely eve will always have its performance limitations no matter how many resrouces ccp devotes to it and im still amazed it works at all because if you havent noticed a lot of mmos or games with moo features dont let you group together at nearly the scales that ccps eve has always tried to allow they push the envelope of performance just by letting us share one universe you may protest and say youre the guy with the solo vaga on some isolated 00 gate but from what ive read that doesnt matter much if those giant fleets are nearby on the same node as you and i personally thought dominion changes would reduce the need for blobs and that alliances would spread out their attack fleets because they no longer have to knock down 20 poss to gain sov in a system but from the sound of things its the same old same ol stuff ps ccp has repeatedly asked for mass particpation in fleet flights on sisi to diagnose and treat the problems im sure it would be benificial if the ppl who experienced this issue the most were part of that testing each time they announce a fleettest date
none of those people feel like living in iceland i think is the problem your seeing
they use the microsoft stack microsoft never gets around to fixing 1015 of vulnerabilities so no security for you
ive been checking on her take care blog thing every couple of days for the update she promised that was coming tomorrow when it happened weeks agoim quite interested in this
im quite sure you can kiss that update goodbye as i take it she doesnt apreciate having a law suit on her hand
petitioned because your thread title discriminates against mazz i can not and will not stand for that
your opinion has been noted however the napkin i scribbled the note on was thrown out along with the rest of the garbageplease biomass yourself
the whole point of the csm is to elect experienced pilots because they know what the hell is going on therefore making them able to render good decisions therefore enabling them to communicate ideas and suggestions to ccp more effectively
not correct  this is the point of the csm the council of stellar management csm is a playerelected council to represent the views of the players to ccp 
if an able articulate and insightful new player successfully runs for csm than thats excellent more power to him or her i saybut a csm seat specifically reserved for one interest group not so excellent should we also have a seat reserved for female players miners pirates
no objections to a new player being on the csm the new player experience has changed a lot and many of us jaded oldtimers may not have experienced it in the current form however im strongly opposed to reserved seats for any group a new player getting elected by demonstrasting strong communication skills and informed opinions will have earned his place someone getting in just because a slot has to be filled wontalternatively ill settle for a reserved seat for 30somethings currently having their morning coffee while watching the warmup show for todays f1 race and posting jaded stuff on the internet
hey look at me im relatively new 25 years and until i ran for csm i had nearzero forum presence supporting newbies is definitely something on my radar because its clearly a retention issue and more players  more iskies for ccp  more resources  hopefully more time spent polishing in fact it and the ui are slowly becoming two major themes i am working on during this sessionone thing i would like to see is for some of the players to get together and develop a really good clueless newbies guide to new eden that picks up where the npe leaves off and the npe should point to it theres a lot of good content in the wiki at present but it is a bit scattered and needs to be organized in a better wayashina your videos and other peoples would fit in quite nicely thereps technically speaking i do represent the younger generation of eve players since my 17 year old son plays eve which means every week or so he slouches up to me with some sob story dad my bs got blown up and mooches 100m off me eve really is a sandbox game
do or should the csm members take an interest in new player experienceissues of course should some 6 month to 12 month new player be on the csm depends on the player the main drawback for a newbie is they dont understand or have any real idea about loads of the game so when those issues come up they have much more work to do assuming work will cut it to contribute or otherwise be unengaged in the discussion ie an empty seat most of csm issues are things that players have been dealing with for quite a while if the new player isnt interested in the game they probably havent tried out various things or played in varying ways this is a handicap for being a valued member of the csm only when a fresh view of a new player which boils down to not knowing things could their voice be useful i dont see how veterans some only a couple years old are so disconnected they cant grasp a new players view by simply trying there is also ccp looking at the new player experience as they do want new players and would like to keep them id say first more new players should get involved voting would help on the forums reading and participating before some call for a new player any new player is championed to represent them absolutely a new player could do well but it depends on how activeinterested in the game they are just having a new player on to represent new players is a bad idea what the csm doesnt need is someone whos views are based on not knowing things or being inexperienced csm is a new experience for most players not all of them have been involved in this sort of software development situation
oh yeah thats fine 
sure vuk and people in politics never lie too
9 months passed discussed twice in iceland still no change will incarna give us a change
what weve all seen has been confirmed in the most awesome minutes ever posted on a series of tubes ccp doesnt care about the csm and hence players concerns or ideas they are merely filler when the direction ccp takes goes that way and if it isnt too hardcomplicatedcostlyfits with what they wantetc they might do it thats all we get for all the time and effort of all the ideassuggestions players have come up with worked on etc that is all their efforts are worth to ccp

bah after this shall we work on the level v skills take too long to train and they frustrate new players to lets automatically give people level v when they reach level iv itll improve new player retention proposal
13071 and counting views156 supportsand this is the horse your backing
well since i have them trained i dont really care but i do know it is killing the new player experience and know a lot of new players that leave because of it its just not fun spending a couple of days training skills that dont get you into something new sure as a experienced player i see the benefit of them but new players dont and dont care they just see it as a annoyance and loose interest in the gamethis would be one way to help the new player experience
read entire thread this idea is way beyond terrible if you think sp are that important raise a crapload of isk and buy a character with the sp that you wantthis is a harsh game it is designed to make players suffer the consequences of their actions as such if you go on a break for a week a month hell even 10 years that is your choice your action nothing to do with ccpyou made the choice to go on a break so suck it up and play the game by the same rules everyone else has to no payment no sp
i would like to add the following to all the strong reasons that other ppl showed here before me against the implementation of what you suggest yes there are a lot and the fact that you dont want to see them doesnt delete themif you payed eve all the time you trained what you thinked to be important at that time with the information you had at that timethat very exact time when there were still nano gangs when there was still because of the falcon when there was still a ddkillingfleets titans and so on and so onit is just plain wrong and not fair to be able to have that training time back now with so much more informationabsolutely not supportedst
if you support this you can support that idea of removing skill queue i like forcing people to be active to keep skills up not click a few buttons and instantly update your old character with 20 mil sp not supported
i think this idea needs a few more supporters for it to be noticed even if its just some sort of grouping function it needs to be done as an inventor as well as pi my mouse goes though more then 3000 clicks a day for extremely repetitive tasks within eveanything to cut that down would be great
i will support anything that makes my mouse batteries last longerhugs tree

there is plenty of corporations who would for 10bmsystem gladly come to your space and not only punish offenders but also actively protect you and hunt down enemies before they strike unfortunately concord isnt one of them
heh at least hes thinking up new ideas anyway i kinda like this idea so thumbs up
concord wouldnt get involved since according to sigs its still a npc rat ship also the hologram should remain active and not able to shut down if engaged in battle thus no criminal flag for aggro no to ship having the same weakness as the projected image this is a mask not a total reconstruction of the ship
idiotic because it would be risk free especially with tech 3 cruisers that would obliterate ratters in seconds even with some penalties there wouldnt be a risk because ratting ships rarely have a tackle and as the bait you could always just leave you want this get a cloaky ship and sit in a low sec belt and wait
there are some market items that you will want to contract search for such as blueprintsto find copies or preresearched bpos and ships to find ships pre rigged
i second that motion with a few little changesdouble thumbs up
ive learned that they are more of a proximity based type weapon meaning theyll shoot at the closest target available weather its a structure or shiphowever i think they should only lock onto and attack hostile targets that attack first thumbs up
fof missiles have been hopelessly broken for years back when missiles always hit for max damage regardless of target they were very useful fof cruise in siege launchers were the win against small attackers now theyre useless85km max range not sure if theyve fixed this and they do perhaps 80 the damage of their t1 counterpartsdue to inconsistent damage on targets they should do 50 more damage anything larger than a heavy missile should simply ignore drones
fix fofs  add tech2 missiles thnxbye
what exactly would prevent me as a bounty hunter from contacting the target of the mission and splitting the rewards this seems like the first thing to do since you get the full bounty from podding and additional npc rewards this system would make the exploiting harder but it doesnt prevent it and the npc rewards will encourage people to create ways to exploit the reward mechanism people will go for the most efficient ways over intended ways of playing in all systems so it needs to be consideredissues with the payments should also be considered a pod is worthless to the target and you still get full rewards and some extra juicy npc rewards that presumably you cant get from other sources this seems like an open invitation for exploitation of the feature i would also like to see the percentage of the reward be tied to in some way to the ship type you destroy killing a nood ship or a shuttle should not you get high rewards since the purpose of a bounty system in eve is to inflict pain on the target if the system cant guarantee that pain there really isnt much point in using it from the point of view of the victim killing a worthless vessel wouldnt achieve this and would allow another way to pump the rewards artificially again so this should not be allowedthis idea has some good things in it as it makes the exploiting harder but it doesnt prevent it and encourages it by offering aditional npc rewards as a bonus the current system is useless but i dont want to see it replaced by a system that has the same basic issues and can additionally be used to farm npc rewards by only using basic communication between players if the npc rewards are useless there is no reason to put them in in the first place if they are lucrative enough most users of the system might very well be people seeking to farm those rewards this isnt to say all these issues cant be solved or mitigated to the point they become nonissues but they need to be addressed before devs waste any of their time on this especially since it seems to require extensive work to achieve
in answer to your first question nothing nothing stops anybody from contracting the outlaw and spliting the money with him but what in your opinion would someone do who promised you to split the money while he suffers from no consequences if he doesnt keep his word im calling this the scumbagfactor sounds neat doesnt it now the payment and the lp store are to be balanced i agree the ratio of payment from kill to podkill however is a single variable easy to be changed the same goes for fixing rockets so i guess my argumentation suffers from ccps lack of enthusiasm on a more general view by creating a system of any kind be it a computergame or the law of taxation you will always have loopholes and you will always have people who will search and eventually find them the only thing you can do is to make explotation less worthwhilethe proposed system if far less susceptible to exploitation than the current one which is in my opinion absolutely worthless if you set a bounty on someones head you can be sure that he will be the one who gets this money thats not how this is supposed to worki think ccp should focus on these little things to make eve more immersive and to give the game more depth in places where a single player might end up playing a few hours per day dont worry the alliance politics etc have more than enough depth if you ask meregards lax1 still supported edited for spelling and i didnt have to add a shiny picture of my new outpost to make reading the text more worthwhile wink wink
i like the ideaas for the bountyhunter contacting the target and making an arraignment to split reward for easy kill this can easily be avoided by placing a gag order on the bountyhunter while the mission is active which should drastically reduce the chance of exploitation quite basically the bountyhunter is blocked or censored im sure vent or team speak could be used to overcome this but it would take a lot of time and effort to find someone that knows someone who knows someone that can get a message to the target now about fleetcorp members involveddemichael crimson hands that off to someone else
im on the fence about that it works for eve possible scams but as someone else put it who is going to trust thata the rewards are justifiable b the rewards existc the bounty hunter will honor the dealoverall this idea for revamping the system is a good one id like there to be some more to it but ccp isnt going to do it and certainly wont do all the things wed like to see so i wont bother with much more than saying i support this
i think this would be a great elementi just wonder how one could integrate the kill value lets say i got popped in an iteron with 20 misk value if the attacker gets killed in a thorax value 5 misk the value of the revenge is hardly achieved maybe by copying the killmail to the agent it would be possible to calculate a certain value one mission maybe as lvl 3 or 4 should consider prices as well mission is done when the attacker has lost an equal value like he took
if the payout was determined by the ship value of the target that could help stop exploitationi also think a gank and trade aka kill rights market would be a great idea got kill rights as a noob cant use them sell em

i agree with everything except the wardec this is supposed to be a thieving sanford and son action not a full blown corp war action also this is only for single offline towers that are abandoned and left to rot in space that have no other structures anchored with it
thisaside from why it shouldnt be done ccp is terrified of changing any pos related codes and have stated so if not for this theyd probably have made a lot of changes already
high sec poss are always vulnerable to wardec i like the idea of stealing a pos however there needs to be some kind of notification system in place it also should take a day or so to accomplish it as with every other posrelated activity

who will ignore it just as they ignored virtually all of the other issues passed unanimously by the csm
this fix has been on the back burner for far too long it is high time that ccp be pushed on this matter in fact the lack of outcry on these forums about this is disheartening to say the leasti propose specifically that ccp do something to fix the fact that members of an alliance can not use copy or invention slots owned by a member of the alliance i would also like to see it made possible for a corporation to make research slots available for public use i realize that may open up an entirely new can of worms but it would be a worth wile use of development time imhopi has already increased operation costs of towers opportunities for players to gather their resources in order to compete in the market would be a natural progression to counter this however this faulty mechanic makes that less worthwhileplease join me in sending a notice to the csm that those of us who care about this issue wants some damned representation
supported although the chances of ccp touching pos and access control code are minimal
i doubt that even after the introduction of incarna and dust we will see this but it is always worth supporting nice to see you are around again patri

i like events
which events the gankaminer hulkageddon one or the latest gankaprimea one guess it doesnt matter since both are aimed at the mining communitythese type of events are just plain griefing with prejudice towards a specific player group which should not be allowed to happen according to ccps rules of conductif youre referring to the sansha invasion i havent seen any of those ive heard from a couple of friends that those are usually over and done with almost as soon as they start due to massive amounts of players waiting for it thanks to the live event chat channel that kind of event should not be advertised before it happensheh ill give this thread a thumbs up and as for the rest of you everyone has the right to voice their own opinion about this game including the original poster
op is referring to events organised by ccp neither of these count but are cool event none the lessmaybe hes talking about this it doesnt victimise industrial characters unless there was lots of ganking which there probably was
that would help with looting and sortingi think deadspace faction and officer modules should also be included
a very similar proposal was voted on by the csm
a carrier module that projects an aoe bubble which uses em to create cap recharge bonus on the ships within the rangeeffect should act like falloff as thats how em workssimilarly the module should be expensive and uses little cap or the module is cheap and uses much cap like irlthis is useful because often in cases where you have triage carrier or such situations your subcap ships are often capinjected or pseudostable these ships would benefit greatly
that would be a awesome idea for a module used on the new mother ship
yeah it is a pain

ok i would not go as far as to ask ccp for an almost expansion based on personel that would take a lot of thinkingall i am proposingasking is that a feature which is already coded ingame be put back on turn slaves into homeless existed when rewards wherent by lp store rewards were offered by the agent when a player reached a certain number of lpsan lp option would be to pay for the transformation the same way that faction ammo costs lp and a batch of regular ammosimple already coded and i believe easy to executei would love to see the ammar version of personel to slaves but i dont know if this existed before and so if it is already codedanyway i think its a great roleplay oportunity with a very easy manpower implementation
i wont vote for anyonee who uses the word isk faucet without having any idea what it means also this proposal would completely ruin any strategic value of moons and make any territory just as valuable as another therefore eliminating the point of warfare small corps in lowsec would no longer be allowed to live just because they are sitting on a useless moon alliances would just capture every single moon to get a bigger share of the expensive materialstldr no
i am going to say confidently that you are completely wrong on all aspects of your statement
what the other guy said it would make strategic locations uselessalso can you imagine how much technetium that would be holy  thats a really bad idea and a really bad 30d cycle you got there
i stand by my point that you do not know what an isk faucet is
ok i will change it from isk facet to passive income or static income what words would you like me to change it to to represent static isk flowso your saying that all strategic locations are based around moons if that was the case when ccp changed t2 production entire alliance locations and such things would have shiftedsigh i was using it as an example it would also not be possible for the number of elements to change because it would not spawn in a new place until the old place has been mined out so the amount available across all of eve would not change at all as far as the cycle time again like i stated that part could be changed but i was using it as an exampleplease reread it if you bothered to even fully read it at all

wrong its a sandbox game w pvp being an aspect of it
no there is one server pvp is enabled everywhere in that server as long as youre undocked that it happens also to be a sandbox doesnt mean its not a pvp game
despite this bit of drama csm5 will lay the groundwork for an organized system to track the playerbases wantsneeds and establish a transparent ccp accountability it is ccps game and if they dont want to do something they dont have to but they will have to tell us they are not going to do something and what is the reason i have high hopes for this current council granted there are a couple slugs on it but thats about the right percentage for a group this size disagree with them but do support them it can only make our game better as a side i really get tired of this annoying pvp chant that keeps popping up it is a sandbox if you want to pvp  fine if you want to mine  fine if you want to explore  fine if you want to build  fine if you want to do all  fine etc etc i realize that there are players whose abilitymentalitydesire dictate they pvp thats wonderful  good for you but please stop whining about the players that make the things and do the things that allows you to pvp we have a great game that encompasses many and varied career paths why it even allows the concerted pvper to whine about the nonpvper there is plenty of troll meat out there lets leave the csm off the menu if you have a concern with them or one of their actions send the chairman or one of the members a direct message bet you get a reply and an anwser that is if your really interested in being concerned in making our game betterbe well
its rather silly to play a pvp sandbox game and then get upset because someone points out that its a pvp sandbox game and while youre mining someone can shoot you because theres one server and its a pvp server and while youre building people can shoot your pos and compete with you for markets and wardec you to make it harder for you to get goods to market because theres only one server and its a pvp sever and if you want to run missions someone can probe you down and shoot you because theres only one server and its a pvp sever because theres only one server and its a pvp sever the fact that its a pvp game does not mean everybody has to pvp all the time team fortress 2 is a pvp game and youre perfectly welcome to run around with a medic every single game you play
everything is enabled everywhere in eve its a sandbox with pvp in it and a lot of other things finn i think ill put you on my to deal with list on my knuckledragger acct and have the induatrialist send you condolancessupport csm
nopeunfortunately the wiki is incomplete we have asked ccp to give us a full overview of all csm issues in their development pipelinebacklogetc once we have that it will be a more accurate viewwhen i did my presentation for csm3 at fanfest 2009 18 of the csm issues csm13 had already been finished at the time 184 issues had been submitted to ccpsee
thank you and good luck getting that info from ccp it would be nice to have information rather than all the recent zulu inspired nerdrage saying the csm arearent useful
82 success rate because 33 issues were not denied is a rather generous statement we did not fail so it was a successagain and again we heard that there is no tagging for the backlog items that no one knows which issues belong to the csm and which notwhere are these numbers coming fromis there a publically accessible list of those finished features somewhere even if it is outdated by now
thanks for the update  personally i dont give a hoot about metrics if the csm can get a couple of our core issues prioritized in the product backlog then im a happy bunny
deleted  fail post
the travel expenses for the csm are so miniscule that they probably dont even get registered in the budget
thats the only important question for csm now but no one from them dares to think about itfunny thing is if csm ever had a chance to influence eve in meaningful way  it is now we cant expect ccp to change their development plans or players to cancel their accounts en masse but possible csm resign could have a positive effect but csm prefer to look like nothing happend and continue to earn their fanfest tickets
well saidop itil qualification is probably more relevant  iso is for big ass companies
while the trails would help somewhat they suffer two problems that my proposal avoids altogether lag a single vector per ship requires a lot less than particle trails i also believe that trails provoked some server side lag that my proposal avoids altogether it uses only the information already gathered by the table overview zoom if you zoomed out completely also in the old days with trails you wouldnt be able to understand what was going on after a certain level of zoom just with trails vectors must not be zoom dependant they can easily be fixed so that youll be able to quickly evaluate the speed of a ship at any level of zoom youre using
i like this and support itid like an acceleration vector as well as the velocity vector though

just adding to this discussion csm minutes aside ive failed to sign up three friends because they took one look at the font asked how to change it and when told they cant change the font face size colour etc their response was what bull followed by deleting the applicationso there are at least three data points indicating that polished quality would sell better than new content new content resells to old players but that is a different issue

i am raising the proposal for several reasons it has received significant support as well as passionate dissent it has significant consequences for the health of the game the csm represents all players  including clueless noobs the issue deserves attention by the full csm they may well vote it down or pass it in modified form but no matter what the outcome i think it is important to get some sort of position on this issue on the record for the simple reason that at some point ccp may decide to make changes for retention reasons and if they do i think its important to have a template out there that suggests how to do it in a manner that is as favorable as possible to the people whove already trained learning skillsthink of this proposal as a condom whose purpose is to prevent a screwing
i think that you are full of it do you have a position on this or are you a true politician i think your wiki article makes it obvious where you stand on this with this one linethe wiki article is a mess including unsubstantiated facts that are likely fallacies if we are allowed to edit your proposals i would have done it directlyconsensus n 1 an opinion or position reached by a group as a wholethis is probably an outright lie based on the definition of consensus abovei would like to see the actual postaccountcancellation surveys that are for truly new players not players creating alt accounts that cite having to train learning skills as a cause for their cancellationi angrily hate this proposal  not necessarily the removal of learning skills but the give me stats or give me basic learning skills  either the learning skills are a problem or they are not either they should exist as is or noti firmly believe that the learning skills should stay as is however if there were to be a change it should be to remove learning skills and refund the actual sp that players have put into said skills all attributes are reduced to nonlearning skill levels refunding skillbooks has to be based on npc sell price and still has issues period anything else is a wolf in sheeps clothing whining entitlement babies who dont like that it takes daysweeksmonths to train for the big shinyi take this position from a player with 3 accounts and 7 characters all with basic learning skills to v and advanced skills to at least iii some iv and 1 with all learning skills at v if they are going away make everything about them go away  dont institute fake attribute boosts and additional remapsa more accurate statement about pros simplifies the skill training decision tree for players removes psychological barrier to undocking without learning skillsa more accurate statement about cons simplifies the skill training decision tree for players increases overall training time for all skills by removing learning bonuses
if the cmss and ccp manage to get this passed there will undoubtedly be a new proposal to readd learning skills which will receive much much more support then this thread received for that reason alone i would much rather the csms and ccp devote their time to an issue which isnt going to result in a proposal to reverse the changesps no supported

wrong forum jita speaks would be better and you could do this by looking at all the csm issues ever raised or just checking this forum for popular threadsif you just look at what people post in reply to this you are going to get conflicting views on issuesi want more attention to 0000 is played by the minority add more pve content
meh fair enough your rite anyway who cares anyway about all those 00 people with on avarage 2 accounts wich 34 makes isk in emp
i like it ofc there r more important issues than owr ships loock like in eveso it was wen i was in army and all my ships had my paintjob in it and im still arroundand moast of the other thingys to be resolved with or without tigermouths painted war going on or not so at the very least some simple tatoos and corpaly insignia should be incremented  this its very simple to doit should also be payed for
ok this is a bit of a niche thing that will only affect a small number of people for those people it does affect though its a pain in the ass and frankly i cant think of any logical reason why it shouldnt be changed currently there is no way to move a station container suggest size of packaged station container be changed to 750000m3

issue the current system makes conquering outposts a means to an end instead conquering outposts should be both a means to an end and an end in its self currently the conquering of an outpost is not a fair balance between riskreward that should be associated to 00 warfarethe current system needs to be changed so that the risks and rewards are in line with other levels of risk and reward that are associated with 00 warfare proposal once an outpost is conquered have a destroyed shell much like how destroyed capital ships are depicted in space where the outpost once was detailed mechanicsgive this destroyed outpost docking rights to everyone with limited functionality to pilots once inside destroyed outpost should have a volume limit so that you cant hide a fleet in a destroyed outpostonce docked the interior will have a destroyed look to it also the cargo and ship hanger will be shared with all who are dock in the outpost any item or ship that was inside the outpost when it was conquered will be subject to drop tables much like destroyed ships are in pvp and the dropped items will be placed in this shared hanger this makes conquering outposts a means in its self instead of a means to an end for solv in space the destroyed shell will have cargo space where a reclamation egg lack of a better term can be placed this egg will have space to put required items in it for the reclamation process much like the outpost platform egg has when building a outpost from scratchitem requirements for reclamation will be lower then that of a regular outpost building platform eggoutpost reclamation will follow the same game mechanics during down time that newly built outposts currently use however anything that remains in conquered outpost that is being reclamed will be destroyed pods ships items everythingpilots logged off in outpost will be poded and sent back to their medical clone location jump clones should be destroyed once the outpost is conquered medical clone game mechanics will need to be changed so that npcs will be the only ones to offer medical clonesif the outpost is not reclaimed the destroyed outpost shell will remain in orbit and be dockable to anyone until reclaimededit sp errors pointed out by omara otawan
result nobody will leave anything significant in an outpost ever again just in case some catastrophe hits them and makes every asset in their possession up for grabs whilst theyre asleepat workon holiday congratulations you just destroyed the concept of the 00 market hub and forced everyone who wants a new ship into making jita shopping trips this is a horrible idea
no csm love for this this is why you need csms that are more industrial then pvp something like this would greatly help improve quality of experience to evea lot of people i talk to about eve have similar reasons why they didnt like it or why they dont play it any more one of those reasons is its a click fest eve really is a very clicky game so many functions in the game require a lot of clicking when something new is added ccp should be focused on reduction of clicking not adding features that require an excessive amounts of clicking to achieveit is clear pi is not a main part of the game and maybe this thread would have been best posted six months from now when pi is pretty much required by most we shouldnt let it get to that point though fix it now while its fresh and new and up for changes with little impactcsms and ccp do not let planetary interaction get too entrenched before making some simple changes to reduce clicking

the ideas listed below are just suggestions as you will notice for the t3 ships i listed there is no slots listed other then the high slots so the rest is open to ccp to decide how balanced they want the ships to be and even if i did list highslots its not manditory ccp sticks to them if this idea is carried to development keep in mind like the t3 cruisers we have and fly today these ships are made to be multirole ships that can be quickly and easily optimized for 1 purpose or job so i tried to keep that tradition alive with my t3 shipsthe other ships are ships that should have been made but never where to do a certain job such as gad cloud harvesting salavginlooting ship transporter and so onim suggesting these because ccp has been neglecting mining and industrial activitys for a couple years now i admit they released the orca and then pi stuff but the actual playable field work and flyable ships only 1 has been added not counting the primae cause its so uselesst3 cargo ship3 rig slotsneeds 1 skill for ship and every subsystem class skill points in these 6 skills can be lost if the ship is destroyed while being pilotedsubsystemsproposulsion5 reduction to cpu or pg and cap needs of a mwd per level2 increased agility per level immune to webbing or lessen by 5 per levelinterdiction nullifiermedium speed warp core strength 1 per levelelectronic5 reduction to ammount neutralizedstolen by cap neutralizersvamps per level99 reduced cpu need for scan probe launchers10 bonus to max targeting range per level15 bonus to ship sensor strength per levelengineering5 bonus to capacitor capacity per level5 bonus to capacitor recharge rate per level5 bonus to power grid capacity per level5 reduction to heat damage on moduals per levelindustrial in place of offencive10 bonus to range and velocity of tractor beams per level 4 high slots10 bonus to access difficulty of salvagers 4 high slotscovert op cloaking compatability 2 high slotsadds a drone bay 5 light drones 1 high slotdefencive10 bonus to cargohold per level max of 50k m3s5 bonus to shield or armor resistance per level10 bonus to shield or armor hitpoints per level10 bonus to armor repair or shield booster effectiveness per levelt3 mining ship3 rig slotsneeds 1 skill for ship and every subsystem class skill points in these 6 skills can be lost if the ship is destroyed while being pilotedsubsystemsproposulsion5 reduction to cpu or pg and cap needs of a mwd per level2 increased agility per level immune to webbing or lessen by 5 per levelinterdiction nullifiermedium speed warp core strength 1 per levelelectronic5 reduction to ammount neutralizedstolen by cap neutralizersvamps per level99 reduced cpu need for scan probe launchers10 bonus to max targeting range per level2 bonus to yield of ore and gas or reduction to ice harvesterengineering5 bonus to capacitor capacity per level5 bonus to capacitor recharge rate per level5 bonus to power grid capacity per level5 reduction to capacitor need of stripsharvestersindustrial in place of offenciveore miners supports 6 t2 strips with hulk bonuses 5 light drones 6 high slotsice harvesters supports 4 t2 harvesters with mackinaw bonuses 5 light drones 4 high slotsgas harvesters supports 5 t2 harvesters 5 light drones 5 high slotsmercoxit miner supports 2 lasers with skiff bonuses 5 light drones 2 high slotsprobe or cloak prototype or improved only can only fit t1 lasers no mining bonuses 5 medium drones 4 high slotsdefencive10 bonus to cargohold per level max of 50k m3s5 bonus to shield or armor resistance per level10 bonus to shield or armor hitpoints per level10 bonus to armor repair or shield booster effectiveness per levelmore in next post

terrible idea rorqual doesnt just haul it compresses hulks mine enoughplus anything bigger or tougher would be too hard to suicide gank then how would we make our money
not supportedi will tell you my resons why1 i already hate losing skill on tech 3 cruisers even though i payed for a clone so i will never support more skill lose ideals2 hulks mine very well and go into high sec i would support a tech 3 with the ablty to swap out 1 of 3 stripers for coveropt cloking but not with inc mining ablitys in high sec or skill lose3 i would love to see a capital mining ship but this one here is over the top i beliveedit on the capital mining ship no capital stripers im thinking that ship is the ship to set up with 5 to 6 stripers that would be worth it right there
dont know if t3 is really the way to go but yes industrial does need more love god only knows why theres never been a dedicated gas harvesting ship that primae model would have been perfect for it
the thing im trying to pus is advancement i agree rorqual is pritty nice but it cant mine on its own and a carrier with 15 harvester drones cant even outmine a hulk with perfect skills but lets face it hulk is  for tankarmor it cant even stand up agenst cruiser rats i want something that will actualy have a decent tank for null sec rats the part your forgetting t3 ships would be very expensive when the cruisers came out the hull alone with no subsystems was over a billion do you think high sec care bear no bodys would be willing to buy let alone lose something like thatif youd look closely at the subsystems i designed youd see theyd have to pick between cargo and tank and most macro miners would chose cargo so that makes them still easy suicide ganksas far as you go rip in order to advance you must pay the price in some way i honestly feel a high price tag and risk of losing skill points in the skills requiered to fly that ship is a fair trade for being more powerful then a t2 ship or have the versitility of 5 ships in one with the ability to change in seconds as far as the capital strip lasers go unless you give it 8 high slots and more laser slots so it could fit 4 strip lasers youd need to make capitals which would also limit the people useing them cause youd need to train up for new lasers just like you do xl weapons when training for a dreadnaught
was just thinking and putting it straight out there why not have a t3 subsystem for cruiser or bs when it gets made to make a bubble like a hic basicly but it would be for t3 so you could make more fits and diffrent fits for it wouldnt take place of hics because most people would still like to fly the hicbut for some and most people i think they might like the t3 bubble subsystem if not for cruiser maybe the t3 bs when it is made this way we have cruiser bubbler destroyerfrig bubbler and a bs bubbler for ultimate bait imagine it for a t3 bs bubble subsystem you warp your t3 bs into middle of a camp or sit it somewhere for ultimate baiting and bubble up d would let you have all meds for tankcap for caldariminmatar and yet would be able to hold everyone on the field unless they leave bubble that isthoughts and flames please p
so you want 1m ehp bait ships with bubblethat sounds slightly op to memaybe make it a defensive subsystem so you cant get the hp amount subsystem and the bubble subsystem at the same time
seems aa good idea tbh does bring it all inlign me like 
this would be useful for lots of things especially if the note could be opened to reveal a much longer user customized message
worth supporting
supporting a good idea
its a nice idea but any small weak alliance which lives close to high sec is not going to have the rediculus 10b a month to pay concord for protection unless they are buying and selling tons of plexsgtcs or have such a high tax the players in said alliance couldnt make any money for them selfs so it is realisticly impossiblemost 00 alliances including my own are 110 jump frieghter jumps from high sec the only pipe running we do is when someone new needs to come in or an old pilot quitting the alliance is leaving if you are to scared to run a pipe pick up a scanner find a wormhole in your system that leads to highsec or low sec 1 jump away from high sec and use that for your needs if you dont have many or any wormholes buy a ihub upgrade for it they made it for a reason00 is made for pvp if you cant handle the heat get out of the kitchen its that simple i flew a orca 50 jumps though 00 with nothing but a scouting frigate time to grow a pair buddy
there exists no game mechanic to enforce such a thing nor one that allows a corporationalliance to effectively police and punish their own people besides hunt em down pa and we arent likely to see such changes in our lifetime or eves
give it a 5 minute cycle like a cyno where you cant warp and cant shut it off then i might think about it

1 player a gets ganked in low sec by pirate x he trades kill rights to player b player b finds pirate x pirate x thinking of the possibility of a less than 100 winnable fight runs and docks regardless of having no knowledge of kill rights being transferred upon being camped pirate x stays logged on and also logs on macro mining alt y while wasting player bs time rinse and repeat day after day and player b gives up rather than waste any more of his own subscription time and loses standings for having no chance to complete the mission system broken2 meanwhile pirate xs macro mining alt y in the usual exhumer gets suicide ganked by player c pirate x transfers kill rights to player d player d ganks player c but now player c adapts by creating throwaway alts to suicide gank with macro mining alt y gets suicide ganked by player cs alts pirate xs alt y transfers kill rights to player e player e cannot find player cs alts because theyve already been recycled system broken3 player f hauls expensive cargo through high sec in a t1 hauler and gets suicide ganked by throwaway alts player f transfers kill rights to player g player g cannot find the throwaway alts because theyve already been recycled system brokenthis is only an attempted stealth nerf to suicide ganking because it does nothing against low sec pirates since this system does not change anything about the low sec theyre in in fact it tries to protect them by helping to safeguard their macro mining alts to exploit and hide behind when things arent going their way by pushing ppl to use alts which they do already this proposal doesnt do anything at all but annoy everyone and waste their time not supported
this is actually a pretty good proposal the only issue would be as the op said populating the system but if people are able to generate enough kill rights on themselves then it would be a great maybe make it closer to the current systemplayers with 10 or lower sec status or players will killrights are able to have bounties placed on their headsbounty cost is initially 1mil cost rises exponentially for multiple bountiesit would certainly make things more interesting and give the system some function
so pirates never lose ships dont be so pessimistic people do fly when there is threat its called having fun possible how about changing the already broken alt rules say only being able to biomasscreate every so many weekssee previous you recycled the same pointright so it wont work cos people will dock up or recycle suicide gankers but its still a stealth nerf to suicide ganking apart from the fact that makes no sense check my kill recordthis is not an attempt to nerf anything apart from the universally acknowledged broken existing bounty system
i like this idea for the most part but would add the following solution to the altuse problemwhen a bounty is placed on a character that bounty is automatically applied to that players entire account the bounty mission received from the agent only shows the character who had the original bounty placed on them after the bounty hunter has located and locked that character any alts on that account if and when they become active are listed with the original and are flagged red the pilot info would show that alts info with the added text  alt of bounty x and that alt would be a legitimate target but the mission is not completed until the original character that the bounty was placed on is killed any alt used by that player would indicate the same for as long as that mission was active but only to the hunter with the mission upon completion of the mission the flags and associated alt info would disappear
they dont when they fly in their usual blobs like u do after all pirates like u dont consider it fun when risk applies to u as well funny how your proposal wont affect u at all so ppl dont have 5 accounts like they do now what exactly is broken about these rules that u have to implement a broken system thats easily circumvented to fix it is it broken because it can be used to actually apply risk to u when ure in your alt and not behind the comfort and safety of your blobno  moron cause i was applying it to suicide ganking haulers1 oh it makes perfect sense now that u asked to look at your killboard almost all of your low sec kills r with the blobs u hide behind besides the pod kills therefore your proposal conveniently wont affect u at all2 as for the high sec killslosses most of them were your corpmates killing each other if anything makes no sense its that especially since they went ahead and posted them comparing that to the 5 mining ship kills 2 of which are not exhumers then comparing the high sec kills to low sec kills simply boils down to u hating suicide ganking just because uve taken more frequent losses than u did in low sec maybe thats why u had your own corpmates kill u so that u dont get tagged by someone outside your corp like i said before pirates like u dont like it when risk or in this case consequences applies to u as well poor baby bottom line is your proposal does nothing since ure just under the disguise of fixing a broken system with another broken system that has no effect on low sec and only attempts to nerf suicide ganking a play style u hate because u cant handle a lossbut plz continueid like to hear it
out of all the bounty ideas ive seen this one is probably the best it also doesnt reward the person placing the bounty which is good while i understood the sell kill rights part of other proposals i never liked the idea that i could sit out in lowsec in a n00b character collecting kill rights which i turn around and sell seems like too easy money this proposal doesnt reward or create an exploitable situation for neither the pirate or the victim so it gets my supportbest replacement bounty system idea to date
good idea to replace the broken bounty system

please ccp
neatalso wtb detaching broadcast pane from fleet pane
yes please
supported although i have reservations about keyboard shortcuts for context menus and would like to have the option of disabling them if they were implemented
mostly items supported easy and fast to do with major gains for the players
i am concerned this might be too big of a change to qualify as lowhanging fruit but i will add it pending comments from other contributorsproposal amended to add this entirely reasonable caveat  thanks
is an exit to character selection button low hangingpopular enough
please add current job statistics to industrial menus onto your list
low hanging fruitadd scan probes to overview configuration options we already know they work internaly and just need to be selected via a more official methodremove the ui enforced pause when scanning for extractor resources in the pi systemfan favouritebookmarks on the overview this would help the elite pvper warping on grid the rookie player trying to find their first mission and my 5 year old daughter who has serious problems rightclicking her way 34 levels deep so she can warp to a missionadd ability to choose whether to showhide the hud while the ui is in planet mode its the only piece of the ui that gets lost
this might be my utter noobishness but how about the ability to easily remove all your waypoints from space instead of having to open the mapedit and i dont mean hide route which just hides your route until you show it again rather than removing your waypoints
or for that matter the ability to switch your autopilot between safershoterless safe without opening the mapalso an easy way to bring up the info page for the current solar system add show info to the arrow menu attached to the system name in the top left
forgive me for being utterly pessimistic that anything coming out of the assembly hall will be readimplemented by ccpbut i have a major concern with this use speed bar color to indicate mwdab status blue  off green  on if webbed the color should alternate between bluegreen and yellow if scrambled it should alternate between bluegreen and red if both webbed and scrambled it should rotate between bluegreen yellow and redand this use capacitor color to indicate nosneut status orange  normal yellow  neuted blood red  nosd rotate colors as in the previous bit of fruit im color blind my suggestions make sure that the colors above are different to colorblind people potentially make these colors options add an option to black out behind the icons please i mean it the game is unplayable in places it should be a low hanging fruit to add more people to the watch list pretty pleaseliang
signed x 1000some small additions would be a massive boost to pvp1 add a player defined popup list of orbit and keepat distances keep your mouse on the orbit or keepat icon and a list with values that you entered pops up it would nullify the current terrible right click fest2 make windows controls bigger title bar close window contextual menus i have a lot of difficulty in always hitting the correct right click menu item in pvp when im in a hurry and i know a lot of other peopUFFFDle have this problem tooedit and i will add this to the main ccp zulu disaster thread as well i see in your wiki post you mention that the ui team has been reinforced i think this is in direct response to the massive amount of player complaints and mass quits that went down there so for all of those who were saying our voices count for nothing perhaps if they are indeed loud enough and we vote with our wallets they do count
many thanks for bringing this up
please but that doesnt help much without ability to organise people in the watch list preferably some kind of folders  ability to drag people on the watch list so if i am in a logistics i can have a folder with all other logistics ships one with the primaries euhm i mean ecm ships etc
i would like also to have an easy ability to see which wingsquad in fleet i am currently in without a pain of trying to find my name in the ever reshuffling and scrollerresetting fleet window especially when there are 100 pilots
i approve
excellent initiativequick question has there been any communication between csm and ccp producerrelationship manager since zulus blogto be honest then my priority would be functional changes instead of the ui  no point in making it easier to orbit at optimal if my rockets are malfunctioning
jesus this please even 12 would be a big help
ever try to look at the fleet window title bar
here are the ones i would like to see drag and drop of bookmarks into chat windows and email place dividers between recover reconnect and destroy probes buttonschange scale of angle slider so each selectable option has equal width in the slider make the slider widershow when probe results are being ignored eg a grayed line that reads 9 additional results ignoredsystem scanner filter should have items for unknown ladar radar gravimetric magnetic wormhole and unresolvedallow input of distance in au in directional scanner range box 114  au 15  km 0  max distancechange wormhole scan result from unknown to wormhole remove fleet broadcasts tab from the fleet make it separate like it used to be allow for more people to be added to the watch list
my bad and thanks
i support this wholeheartedly but would add two moreupdate the font whether this would entail improving the current one changing to a different one allowing a personal font or a combination of the three it is needed desperately im not sure if this would be a fan fav or a low hanging fruit thoughadd a sort option to the corporate assets especially the deliveries just as the personal assets has which allows sorting by jumps with regionconstellationsystem filter as i sostoned points out below number of items and name that deliveries list can be extremely long at times from corporation buy orders and can of course span the entire map but there is no way to sort it so setting a route for pickups can be unbelievably tedious tiresome and usually never quite rightas for prioritizing the lists how do you prioritize those low hanging fruits some are more important to one group of players than another while others may never be needed by some but would be a top priority to someone else they are all important put them in some sort of alphabetical list or sort them from perceived easiest to hardest and give ccp the entire liston the two big wins i support them both as long as the shortcuts are an option that can be toggled on and off in the options window
no mention of inventory handling ui specifically corporatemarket deliveries hangar needs sorting functions identical to personal assets by range filterable by regionconstellationsystem

with respect to the question of how to do the prioritization what i was planning on doing was waiting a few days for the list to stabilize then number them and have people submit their priority rankings for as many items as they want to rate this should give a decent priority order and also ensure that this thread reaches the coveted threadnaught status it may be more difficult than it appears but if there is significant support for it in the thread ill add it to fan favoritescan you expand on exactly what you mean by this tamberaddedthis is edging into design rather than ui and pi is still evolving so i would prefer to hold off on this for the time being it annoys me too as well as do the customs office delays personally i think the delays should be more dynamicadded also ongrid bookmarks in space though that again is edging into designspace otoh i really want it personallyaddedautopilot items  not sure if they make the cut can you suggest particular menusmechanismscolorblind issues  thanks for reminding me have added a hud blackbackground lowhanging fruit and a standard eve colors fan favorite to address these issuesuseful addedthis happened before the june summit actually if you read the summit minutes there is a mention of itadded this and a ship type column request for the watchlisti can neither confirm nor deny the confirmation or denial of any such communicationsthis would be handled by the general ui menu suggestions if it turns out ccp is going to do a pass on these ill crowdsource a big list for themfrom the summit minutescsm asked about the status of the eve font pointing out that a change has been requested for two years ccp stated it is currently designing a new font there have also been tech issues regarding the font 80 of the font redesign is finished and will hopefully be integrated late this year csm questioned the rationale behind designing a font from scratch rather than licensing an existing one potential licensing costs and the desire to be able to exercise control and consistency over the font design were cited as reasonsnot unreasonable added
my reason for suggesting the numericalpha system as opposed to the windows system was as follows its a plugin system that can be applied to all menus globally thus much easier to implement many of the menus that are hardest to navigate multilevel for example are dynamic in nature consider the inspace menu that lists planets belts etc a windowslike system doesnt do well with those kind of menus a big reason for doing this isnt to have shortcut mnemonics its to have a faster and more reliable way of navigating deeply nested menus for example you jump into that big gatecamp  a onepixel mismouse when trying to warp to a belt at 100 can get you podded
everything in low hanging fruit and anything else you have time to do from the othersnot sure if its there didnt see it but i have issues so it could be there but a larger overload button or it slightly separated the number of times i have turned off my hardners instead of startingstopping them overloading is just silly
loving all the ideas would be awesome if they were all implemented
love the fanfavorite of bpo and bpc differentiationwould like to see a faction and officer corner tab on said items like the current t2 and t3 tags my personal suggestion mentioned and supported here in the hall before and my addon to the meta searchlove the abmwd differentiationlove the ui improvements like the contextual menu fixes and fixing the eve fonti cannot tell you how frustrating the contextual menus are in eve you only use them for a split second why are they so small and hard to use what i mean is that you have to precisely navigate them just make them bigger and easier to use like windowslove the nosnuet cap idealove drag and drop bookamrks into chatthe thing i really dont like on the fruit list is the view target at more than 100km  this can be used offesively and serves no purpose other than to allow a new profession of on grid cloaked spies there has to be a limit and why not the current 100km it is not arbitrary as it is listed i am sure ccp agreesotherwise great csm post and thanks for all your time you put into thishow about a thread now that covers nongui items so we can start tackeling that
1 when looking at the variations tab in show info for items list in order of meta valuecurrently to find them out i either have to scroll down the attributes tab for each item or hit compare and find the meta value checkbox which leads me to my next one2 when comparing items the rightclick contextual menu should include view market detailsand also3 for items meta value 6 or even all items add view available contracts button4 allow naming of jumpclones5 allow custom changes of ui colours used for overheating modules speed bar when webbedscrammed capacitor when neutednosd etc that would easily enable the colour blind to avoid combinations that are no uses to them
supported also this
how could anyone let this fall by the wayside distressthis idea is awesome make it so support
great idea
not a bad idea it would be better to have a popup showing the modifier when you hover over an implant
my idea is to have small deployable shielded structures that can be placed next to other structures in orbit around planets in low sec these structures can be placed down by solo players for research possibly ship fitting and a small hanger bay for storage they could be either solar powered or fueled like poses but the only fuel i would think is worth putting in them is a few hours of strontium this will allow groups of solo players and small corps to get a foothold in low sec systems it will provide the needed copy and research slots for industrialist even if it is only one as a group people who live around a planet the only way to protect themselves would be grouping together to fend off piratescorporations or alliances can also sponsor and protect these as a means to recruiting new members or just to try to keep them running but let the players decide like most of eves features i think these should be relatively fragile and cheep way of surviving in low sec where hopefully enough people will band together to keep a shanty town together make the structures shield accept passwords form any players so they can be shared or used as drug drop off spots maybe limit the ship enter size to bc since stations and poses are still a usable for anything larger they wont work everywhere but it would be cool to see them popping up over time a pos works in a similar way but with the pos you need a corp and to cover the fuel cost before it can be profitablei am not very good with the whole game balancing things but i thought this idea was good enough to sharedeath nova
pos for the people i can dig that
sure why not make it reasonably worse than pos modules and reasonably better than nothing and it might work out nicely especially since the models for such things are already in the gameit would also add targets appropriate for small roaming gangs yet not interesting enough for armadas
this seems like a very fun idea to add to this idea and give it more of a shantytown feel maybe have these structure be able to link up with each other or have them be able to be in the same grid to each other will need some type of treaties to prevent enemies from setting up shop aswell that way solo playerscorpsalliances may have a centralized spot to conduct operationsto further the suggestion even more maybe ccp can release a new region for these towns to thrive in the region should have some type of abundant blackmarket item to collect and a very low station count maybe 1 or 2 stations for the entire region the region can also give a boost to these structures the region should also be mostly lowsec with a few highsec systems around to conduct trademaybe have the structures be able to get into reinforced mode for a day or two to give smaller corps a fighting chance
i like the general idea but it needs some reasons to exist that lowsec stations and poss dont givemaybe these shanties could house habitation modules like you see in npc areas that possibly anyone can add a habitation module to an existing shanty maybe they can only be started at a vacant panet with no station maybe they could house the black market as discussed in my thread about making lowsec betterso possibly a shanty township may start like thisonly 1 or 2 per system only lowsec possibly only in non station systemsthe black market is only accessible in these townsthe module of brothel is placeable here along with hab modules maybe shipyards that people can charge for repairs etcdrug manufacturing possibleits a good idea that could be built on maybe giving lowsec an extra unique feature where people can have thier own little slice of action in lowsec owning brothels ship repair facilities etcwould the op mind if i add this to my main thread outlaw
funny idea however you need a way to defend them 247 as people like me would go look for cities to kill when there are no players around so if you make them as weak as pos structures they would not last for more than a few minutes in low sec
this is true however if tied in with an alliance or coalition who would defend their structures since if you are going to invest in something like this it ouwl almost certainly be in or very close to where you amass your guys it would be another reason for warfare which is goodalso you could make it so that each module could be killed relatively quickly but to destroy the whole thing could litterally take days if it had enough modules built onto it all owned by individuals and goupsso if a module took 10 minutes of pounding by 10 bss and the whole shanty had 200 modules add to that the options of better defences and more expensive shielding etc and you get a truly large sprawling structure it becomes a destroyable minor outpost but any respectable alliance would defend their sponsored township with all their might
the structures could have an upgrade feature for stuff like defense maybe turrets and storage for more ratting loot they could also be upgradeable as a entire town like in dominion give each town the ability to have strategic levels that will allow for defensive and more structures strategic levels should upgrade base on the time the shanty town has survived the greater purpose would be a forward base for pvp and ratting and a copy slotsresearch slot for industrialist in low secit would also bring more life to unoccupied parts of spacethanks for the good feed back

no no nohow would i make a living theni have 13 accounts 2 active at any one time i paid for one account for a year at 14140 and now i keep it active with the buddy system and eventually with plex each month i started a new account first on the buddy system and then active with a plex both from my main account trained it up set up the datacores and market then let it expire i did this for one year now i reactivate the first account of my 12 other accounts with a plex from my main account which has an additional year of time now due to the buddy system it has been sitting as a ghost for one year and accumulating income i do some additional training and get set up for the next year of being a ghost then transfer the money and any leftover items to my main account and let it expire while reactivating the next account rinse and repeati worked hard to do this and spent a lot of time setting it up and it isnt right that you should ask ccp to stop my exploit errr marketing endeavorsfiction offsupported
aye
supported personally id get rid of all the extra crap around the idea tho if a pos is offline then let anyone have the power to start unanchoring it send a mail to the corp telling them an unauthorized unanchoring is taking place and have unanchoring take exactly the time it takes normally keeping poss fueled is a pain in the ass and yes sometimes they go offline this is eve you screw up and you pay the price for that this proposal would almost certainly cost me a lot more than it ever made me but im still supporting it 100
time moves forward the numbers at the top of repliesposts indicate the date and time they were made my response predates your edits as everyone can see except you try reading posts before you reply complaining people dont follow your suggestions
ok bhattran first off there is no reason for giant text like that thats the same as typing in all caps this was written before your post on this proposal it was at the very bottom of it this is what i was referring to so after your reply i decided to edit the whole thing and make it more clear as in edit some of the main paragraph and add the same comment above at the top and the bottom also the title of the proposal says gender changefinnaly bhattran i am not looking for an online argument they are completly pointless and no good ever comes from any of them i am only showing you why i said what i said now with that behind us and the overall point of this proposal clear please support or dont support

issueonce upon a time sovereignty of solar systems in eveonline was governed by pos countsto ease the grind of sovereignty battles corporations were limited to anchoring one pos per day preventing pos spam something i think everyone wanted to avoidsince the dominion expansion this is no longer the case tcus now do their thing and pos essentially play no role other than to stage an attack or defence from as well as offer protection to the ihubthere is no longer any reason to pos spam except when setting up industry or attempting to deploy multiple staging pos in a hostile system to hope at least one livesproposalremove the pos anchoring limitations or increase them significantlyregards llamaofdoom

you might want to read the gm reply correctly he stated that there is a bug that drone rats are not shown correctly on the kill mailqbzor is in etherium reach which is part of the drone regions so he got killed by drone rats as the server recorded him as online he wouldnt get any reimbursement and this thread is locked rather soon for violating forum rules

confirming both my accounts are now cancelled will not be resuscribing
i went through all csm minutes up to fanfest 2009 and compared the issues that were accepted by ccp to the featuresfixesetc that were added to the game since the start of the csm it was a lot of work but to improve that in the future were working with ccp to get csm issues tagged as such in the backlog as well as improve ccpcsm communication when the status of such an issue is changed that will allow us to keep track of the state our issues are in
you are probably right but a new coffee machine for the ccp devs increasing productivity on monday mornings would be a better allocation of funds than the csm
i can assure you that mass resignation would accomplish nothing staying the course and using every grain of progress and yes there has been some to gain traction to build further momentum is the right thing to do at this juncture well keep working issues as we always have and will make sure our priorities list is in front of people at the right time and with the right message to get proper attention at dev planning sessions in addition to that well continue to push for better collaboration and communication with ccpwhich might not be measurable in a tangible sense but is critical to the process in fact our efforts in this regard are already getting results hopefully that translates over time into getting attention on the things that so many of us believe should have priority from ccp if we all resign that will never happenor well just be replaced with others and valuable momentum will be lostall i can say is this is a process its not easy its not fun but it is evolving in the right direction i think the minutes from the june summit showed that this csm means business like never before just have a little faith and see if we can leverage the progress weve made so far into something that will earn your support for our efforts
i absolutely agree that a mass resignation of the csm would be counterproductive and that it would be far better to see how ccp responds over the next few months  the csm and the playerbase or at least the forumdwelling rabble have made their dissatisfaction known and the ball is now in ccps court ugh clicheas an aside among the deliverables is a list of outstanding balance issues to be prioritised by the csm and then sent to ccp for evaluation will this list be made available to the general playerbase
i think having a csm is a great idea to begin with my fear is that the community will arrive at a point where they see it as a right instead of a privilige
and my experience of scrum is that it actively encourages release of unfinished content that is supposed to be improved over time but never is as the improvements are always added to the backlog and never looked at again guess ccps use of scrum is the same
lol  i just spilled my coffee  this is hillarious
when the tactical overlay came up in fanfest roundtables noah reacted like he had wanted to scrap the feature because he believed no one used itnot like its the only thing that gives you any kind of perspective or anything

funny when people come here pretending to know stuff and posting strong opinions like this are you in marketing do you know what any of those words meanscrum is an agile software process that means that unlike the waterfall model which was used before it aligns fast in scrum and agile in general you work with small teams frequent releases of small fixes so that you and the client together work for a product that meets the clients needs instead of a goahead model where you plan the stuff then code package and sell it then ask the client didnt you order walkinginstationsyou claim an agile process is hard to turn around its not ccp claims to use scrum but is still not listening to their clients the very core of the scrum process so there you have it you dont know what youre talking aboutccp is a pompous pile of manure thats openly boasting about a software engineering process they apparently arent even usingedit as for the original topic i dont give a rats ass people in big nullsec alliances cant participate its just another failed minigame half the clientbase cant even try
id support but only if ccp implemented learning skills replaced with focused training instead
supportedlearning skills are a flawed mechanic while no fix would be popular with everyone that isnt a good reason to keep a poor gameplay design
not supportedlearning skills are part of the game from the beginningthats why i learned the learning skills first to get the benefit of itif you dont do it its your mistakei have all learning up on all my chars so now i want have the longterm benefits of this game mechanicbecause if ccp removes them now this would really suck to me because then i will loose my trust to the game and i will never make any longterm plans anymore
not supportedeve has bigger issues than learning is evil complainslearning skills are good for increases the time all the iskselling characters are flying covertors or bigger increases the time all the iskselling characters are flying nighmarepaladingolem s increases the number of rtards that are complaining about eves game design  i wonder if everybody who sign the petitions so far ever worked in gamedeveloping industry or if have knowledge about gamedesign increases the number of rtards that are complaining about ammar ships increases the number of rtards that are complaining about caldari ships increases the number of rtards that are complaining about gallente ships increases the number of rtards that are complaining about minmatar ships increases rate for the grieferscarebearss are spawning in game ie everyone will have 5 alts with bs that will pop everything at 10 gates  and nobody  ccp employee  will check 100 bilions lines of logs to apply the proper punishment decreases the time all the s leaves and plays wow makes a good difference between an industrial pilot and a pewpew pilot  otherwise everybody will know everything superbad older people will feel bad about choosing eve when all pvp fights will be with 14yearoldblobs in 10 holy i will ask for refunds  all of them  friends of friends of friends will have so many isk in day 1  why im even bodering they are 50000 players in weekends at the moment  if friends of friends of friends will play  every system will be jitaso you dont have to bring your moronic friends to have fun all games should be played by everyone is silly and childish  sleipnir has 1 slot im so ing sad  lets remove learning is based on your alcoholic unconscious brain if you say i have to stay 2 months in eve docked and im losing time saving money for my titan you should play wow yeah wow is better go play it eve is dying and losing player because of the bugsgriefers10000 isksecond carebears eve is dying because some ships are not even usedthats bad game design and only 45 shipsper race are frequently used eve is dying because ccp introduces new planetary features instead of new ships and jovian empire eve is dying because everything is redundant and with or without learning your moronic friend will still get boredtrue stories dudeim doing missions  and omfg my tank breaks but thats ok im aligned and at full spead  waiting for my drones waiting for my drones where are you drones  heeeey im in half armor  let me warp out  press warp to button  yourending yes your ship has warped outone second later omfg im in capsulegate camp  oh goddie pew pew peeeeew ship blowsone second later omfg im in stationmoralei have broadband connection and an quadcore intel processor and my ships gets destroyed from time to time and im lagging  and i still have fun with my ingamerl friends but you are telling me you cannot because of the learning skills just  off
times sinks are badi am currently in at about 13 million in learnings 45 everything mostly 4 id support removing of the learning skills even if only 5 points are added to the attributes and no sp refundedless points added and the higher rank skills are going to make my bite my deskso thumbs up
i substantially agree with the contents of the proposal you should note that i raised it knowing that it would be controversial and probably get me at least lightly toasted in this thread i did so because i feel it is a topic that needs debate at the csm level because i view it as an overall longterm health of the game issuei am open to evidence that there are errors in the presentation also note that all csm proposals are drafts subject to debate and modification during the actual meetings even if it is passed certain aspects of it may be strengthened or weakened after discussion by delegatesso would i unfortunately this information has not been made available to csm getting more info out of ccp has been an enduring csm themealas the perfect is the enemy of the good there is no solution to this issue that will satisfy all the players the point of the elimination proposal was to address the perceived retention issue while not affecting the training rate of existing players except for the people who have trained advanced skills to vwhile as a purist from a gamedesign standpoint i would say dump the learning skills and adjust training times so that the average rates are the same as they currently are the realist in me is tending towards the other proposal 3s in everything as default as easier to do while getting most of the benefits and not affecting people with advanced v skillsthe bottom line is if ccp doesnt think there is a retention issue associated with learning skills they will simply dump this into the backlog to rot if they do better we have some input and public debate than for them to present you with a faitaccompi that will cause you to ragequitpolitics is indeed the art of the possible
well to begin with there is no consensus in the csm that the learning skills are a problem  since you havent had the meeting to discuss themthen the claims that new player retention is affected by the learning skillsthen the claim that changing them would improve new player retentionthen the claim that the only negative impact is bitter old vetswith no facts and a biased presentation i turn this back upon you present facts that any of these are true before stating them as facts you are the one making claims where is your evidencei am merely accusing you of making claims without facts to support them
i support this although i would like fine tuning of the implementation probably just allow players to immediately distribute the sp from learning skills rather then giving a time bonus

hey therenot sure if this has been mentioned before however i beleive that dictor pilots should have more ability over the bubbles they deploy it would be nice to have an option on the bubble or scanner area where probes which is what interdictor bubbles come under  warp disruption probes can be destroyed at the dictor pilots discretion currently you have to wait 2 minutes before the bubble goes down which can be annoying to your fleets so it would be nice considering you can decide when it goes up you should also be able to decide when it comes down or gets destroyed by selecting the probes in the scanner area and clicking destroyerad
nope i think its best that you commit to using a bubble not just spam em and drop em as you please i think it is a good and balanced feature that you must pay attention or risk being caught in your own bubble
er nointerdictors can poop out as many probe bubbles as they want to so long as they have enough and those bubbles cannot be destroyed by enemies and interdictors can run away while the bubble is up provided that they are not within the bubble themselvesinterdictor bubbles are small anyways relatively speaking you can burn out of one if you really need to be somewhere elsenot supported
i loldterrible idea though having all services disabled until a conquered outpost is repaired isnt that bad
honestly because outposts cant be destroyed this issueproblem is going to get increasingly worse as alliances continue to build themi get the reasons why they wont allow them to be destroyed but if this isnt sorted out soon its just going to get worsebiggest reason for allowing them to be destroyed  makes them much more valuable than they areas to how they are destroyed thats up to you to sort out
youve obviously never mined in a properly fit hulk in 00 it can not only tank multibs and cruiser spawns but kill them pretty quickly if they are in targetting range or your drones auto lock on them handy hint for free  do not fit two mining upgrades and a roid scannerhulk is fine no need for another ore mining vessel
then tell me your fitting cause the only hulk fit iv seen capable of tanking 3 bs spawns is nothing but phiti b type moduals with the exception of the lasers and 5 medium drones have 1412 the dps of a drake which depending on your skills struggles to kill tripple bs spawns in under 5 minutes oh and if you fitting if that phiti b type fitting id rather spend the money on a asome t3 ship and use t2 moduals then spend half a billion on moduals to put on a ship that can easily be ganked by players
i support a ship for mining with more laserscargohold than hulk i find the hulk to be to small for solo mining ops even with cargo rigs i shouldnt need an orca for decent high sec mining90 carebear for life
thats the fit he is talking about surger cakes just want you were asking for you have to give something up in order to gain something and as a side note you should not care what kind of dps a mining ship has just be happy it has any at all
excuse me oh hi thank you no ships that can mine more than a hulk please if it happens heres what will happen1 youll be out in your pwnmobileuberhulk mining ore woot mining actually makes money2 after about a month there will be so many minerals on the market because everyones mining in pwnmobileuberhulks that the prices will crash3 eventually itll even out so that mining in a pwnmobileuberhulk will be just as profitable as mining in a hulk now with mining in hulks being worth less and using a retriever almost pointless the mineral market will crash thus you get less for your ore so you have to mine more to get the same amount of isk you got before
you missed a part out ie the bit where reprocessing mission loot suddenly becomes less lucrative count me in 
firstly it is near impossible to lose a hulk in 00 if you are paying attention to local if you afk mine out there you are going to lose it and deservedly soa hulk with a pithib is what 300m these days thats well short of 500m just for modules but you would rather spend more than the cost of a wellfit hulk on a 500m t3 ship to mine with that will be just as easily be ganked by players if you are still afk mining
k first of all i dont afk mine doing that period high sec or not is stupid i have corp mates friends and what not i talk to while mining and also listen to roam pvp ops on ventsecond the fitting im talking about has 4 complex grade moduals 4 x 300m  12b in moduals second of all hear of a interceptor a interceptor can warp from the gate to the ice belt before i can get in full warp and we have tested this its why we put up bubbles between the gate and at least 5 differnt beltsand 3rdly like all t3 ships or capital ships you dont see them every day high sec care bear s wont fly them cause when they get ganked they have to retrain and 90 of every one i meet in 00 is combat and doesnt even fly a retreaver so the number of ships wouldnt be exploded in number besides i sell my ore to the alliance to fund their capital ship constructions so we can crush some one when they come looking for a fight so even if i had 6 alts all running rorquals and capital mining bardges it wouldnt affect your stupid high sec markets anywaynow can we stay on topic please  proving you trolls wrong every time you post is rather boring
i cannot support the constant flood of requests for t3 industrials i just cannot see the need for such shipsalso i do not see the need for a new mining ship beyond the hulk do people not understand that it will have absolutely no effect on the mining profession minerals are not worth anything but the time it takes to extract them once everyone upgrades to a new mining ship everyone will be extracting at the same speed and overall the minerals will drop in price so that miners are making pretty much the exact same amount of isk as before not supported
im tired of seeing posts like this i understand you dont support the t3 industrials or mining ship but your not even recongizing the other ships that have been listed here and magnus like i said in my last post not every one will use them care bares wont cause it would make them bigger targets more expensive ship  higher gank risk getting ganked more often  less profit for them
i am all for supporting the industrial aspects of eve i have a rd alt that i love to play even more than my main since fleet lag came in after dominion but the ships that i think industry really needs are ships that actually have a separate role ships that do something completely differentships like a dedicated science vessel perhaps with a single me research slot on it plus role bonuses to analyzers and code breakersships like a dedicated salvage boat perhaps on a destroyer hull for the lulz with bonuses to tractor range and salvaging i dont see a need for modular haulers or capital sized mining ships sorry
firstly what in satans perineum is a 12bn hulk fit and more pertinently whysecond ever hear of istabs hulk gets to warp in around 1012s no way can an interceptor get from gate to an ice belt target and get in point range in that time oh and you have bubbles up hang on ice belt so you are actually talking about mackinaws then and not ore mining i mean no real miner is going to mine ice in a hulk are they being smaller pair of istabs get to warp in 89s the only possible way a prepared and vigilant miner will get ganked in 00 in hulk or mack is if the ganker logged at the belt in which case your 500m t3 ship with 12bn in modules will also diethirdly commas colons and semicolons they are your friends relax breathefourthly you were one who brought up the subject of exhumers having a  tank and incorrectly so their tank is fine you otd your own thread there plus highlighting why we do not need more oreice mining vessels is not trolling or offtopicfinally to go back to your original proposal its way overpowered 1 warp strength per level 6 t2 strips you want more ore for less work and less risk the op sounds like a macrominers wet dream the only thing your proposal is missing is the kleenex subsystem 10 more tissues per level
i read your entire post but didnt register anything you said
overpowered
supporting this
would be nice
when i started playing i thought the game was developed logically it was cleverly derived into 3 global areas where every kind of people can have their fun1 high security  for cowards like myself2 low security  for maniacs and pirates3 null  for the great gang warsand it appears that the high security zone has no security at all pirates just sacrifice their ships gladly getting the insurance which compensates their loss from concord almost completely and grabbing the loot from the wreck of a legal citizen who was flying right in the heart of empiresomething should be done to allow normal people fly safe in the high security sic areas1 all insurance should be void for any ship killed by concord no sane insurance company would ever insure criminals from being busted by police forces2 the wreck of the ship killed in pvp that considers high security areas only should be immediately sealed by concord so no one else can take the loot except the legal owner or at least make the ship completely destroyed with all its parts and loot if that ship had been pvp attacked and killed in hisecs so the piracy in hisecs will become unprofitable and everyone will be able to play normally
there are 12376129438646 other games out there that are just like you describe how about you start to play one of these instead of trying to ruin this one game so many people liked for more than a few weeksmonths remember you choose what game you play so stop trying to ruin it for the people that actually enjoys the game as it is
whats ruining the game if you want to be a pirate  low secs are a real paradise for you cowards choose high secs for safety risc kills fun for us everyone goes where it suits him whats wrong with it
you assuming high sec is supposed to be 100 safenewsflash it isnt
then it isnt really high security just a glorified version of low security
doesnt it make sense that a pirate will go where its prey is  hardly anything worth looting ventures into lowsec so u can hardly call it paradise for pirates
messengerin highsec by design you are safer not safe the game is design to punish carelessness even in safer areas so you either need to be diligent or you need to come to grips with the price of being lazyyou are operating from the presumption that hisec is supposed to be safe its a fundamental misunderstanding on your part
whats the point in game if your ship got locked and ripped when youre doing mission in hisecs where is laziness and misunderstanding here ive never ever did a risky things never taken a possibly dangerous mission never responded on pvp provocations and never ever will go lowsecs and still theres a risk to die for nothingits just a games bugs exploiting getting insured from cops the biggest nonsence one can hardly imagine more absurd thing than insurance from suicide evenand if there is a high security area its really presumed to have some security at all now its got nothing like that pirates can kill everyone they wish get an insane profit and receive no real punishment for that
i want to play this game by jumping my ships into a secure area where people are completely disillusioned to how the game actually works i then want to quickly and easily kill these people take the very expensive loot from their ships and drink their tears i want to do this whenever i want with little to no penalty besides not being able to move goods in highsec not being able to buy things in highsec not being able to survive gate gun agression in fun ships while fighting in lowsec having to make alts to make money in highsec to fuel my pvp obsessions no penalties none therewho are you to tell me i cant play this game the way i want towelcome to the sandbox
it sounds like i want to come into your house whenever i wish re your wife kill your children and force you to eat their meat and there should be no penalty for that no penalty at all who are you to tell me how to enjoy myselfevery one censored like you ruins game for at least ten normal people a day hope the developers would take that in mind
no it sounds like you take the game look up the definition way to seriously and probably need to take a break from your internet spaceship pixels for a while the fact that you can even compare a game to  and murder indicates just how twisted and warped your sense of reality isalternatively youre a troll in which case 1 internets to you for getting people to believe that load of horsecrap in the op
my desire to do those things has nothing to do with my desire to gank your mission ship please keep on topic we get our penalites for suicide ganking and believe it or not it does make the game more difficult to be sitting at 10 security status on top of it all we have to read dozens and dozens of whiney why isnt carebear land perfectly safe all the time baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww posts every day please think of the pirates
the game takes real time real effort and real money and id gladly without any scent of remorse murder anyone whod ruined my real effort but there is 1one thing why ill never do anything like that know what the penalties if i murder someone  ill met the direst consequences go to jail and ruin my own life well thats just what im talking about crimes should be punished harshly at least in the civilized part of the world
those penalties are the results of your own crimes exclusively people doesnt force you to be a pirate so why should they suffer for your enjoyment
and still all i hear isbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwi will concede that even though i love suicide ganking insurance payout on concord kills is a little ed up everything else is positively silly just because you dont understand game mechanics doesnt mean you get to be safe and cuddly every time you press connect on your login screen youre consenting to at least some form of pvp when you press undock that form of pvp is getting your ship blown up ccp knows this happens ccp likes that this happens ccp endorses these actions the reason it works this way is because its the way ccp wants it to work dont like ithello kitty online is that way harden the  up
you consent to pvp when you log in if you dont like that or agree with it id suggest you find a new game to play your tears will not change this
at least some sence from you unexpected reallyplease explain me silly one thing about game mechanics i dont understand at all how can i prevent being suicide ganked right in the middle of the mission or everyone should fly exclusively in tengu with a full antiscan fitthere is a hell lot of pvp areas and a big red warning in front of them when a player jumps there  he seals his own death sentence and that is his own choise for pvp if ccp greatly desires to sacrifice tons of normal people to a handful of maniacal perverts  thats the best way
where there is reward there is risk that is what ccp go by if not rats killing you then a player will eventually kill youeve is not safe no where in eve is safe everyone is a target everyone is prey
confirming im a maniacal pervert who s wives burns houses and eats babiesnomnomnomits like this forum isnt even moderated you cant even get threads locked for trolling anymore
piracy is piracy even in low sec which is also insuredsurvivingavoiding a suicide gank in a missioning ship requires u to not be mentally slow or fail fitted no eccm subsystem t3 required both of which apparently fits uthis is not world of warcraft where u have battlegrounds and sanctuaries u want that go back to wowstep back from the keyboard look around u then take a deep breath try it
so youre willing to kill the guy who beats you out of a promotion at work but you wont because you might get caught and go to jailand yet you say the pirates in eve are the ones with the problems im not sure theres a pill to cure what ails youalso im now convinced youre trolling because thats too damned crazy to be true
just to add to what develdrin saidyoure claiming that this ruins your fun when youre suggesting that youd kill someone for ruining your fun doesnt just perhaps cross your mind as ruining their fun just a littleand also eve isnt a civilised part of the world so in conclusiongtfobtwow troll
no way if he beats me in work  it just means hes better in work honest and simple but if hed say stolen my wallet  thats way another story for that i could kill with no doubt but wont im a very lawabiding citizenno one irl or anywhere ive been in games couldnt say i treated him unfairlyits all about rules if a person follows certain rules say dont fly in low secs dont respond on pvp provocations etc he shouldnt possibly got killed now the game has no rules and no one nowhere in no way can prevent himself from being suicide ganked by the way ive never been ganked on mis although been provoked many times  but that doesnt count but know many of such an instances if id lose my ship  ill have to quit its too expensive and i dont want to quit
not even for a little bit the guilt is entirely on initial agressor and the harder hed been punished for that  the better
bingo next topic please
correct thats a pretty good descriptionhisec isnt meant to be safe it just has more rigorous rules of engagement in practice this means that its significantly safer than losec but by no means absolutely safe and it was never intended to be completely safe ever
its safe inside the station
if you dont want people to suicide you dont fly ships that are easy or worthwhile to suicide no faction mods no expensive cargo good tank
eve online is unique in a sense that piracy griefing smacktalking is allowed even encouragedsometimes it creates highly dramatic situations that provides the other side endless entertainmenti have no doubt that when ccp would revamp this game in some kind of world of warcraft carebear heaven they might get more subscriptionshowever ccp is clear that they want eve online to be a unique sandbox where everything or close to everything is controlled by players with as much freedom as possiblethese discussions about making this another carebear heaven game are endless there lots of people wanting that with always the same answer it wont happenwhile i have respect in your point of view i suggest you accept eve online how it is in its own unique way or try find another gameor to say it ccps words htfu
messenger you must understand something one of the basic tenants of eve is nonconsensual pvp if someone wants to engage you they will find a way be it through wardecs suicide ganking market pvp resource wars etc in this way eve is very similar to real life but thats also where the similarities endi vaguely recall the devs saying some years ago on how they wanted to see how people would behave in an environment where the rules were not so clear cut where people could make choices on their own without the game mechanics interfering too muchto this effect you have a wild west scenario in space cities highsec are safer than towns towns lowsec are safer than the wilderness nullsec i put emphasis on safer because even cities are not safe people will still commit crimes in general because they have usually accepted the consequences of their actions and are fine with it risk to reward ratio raising the penalties will not change that it will just make people more selective of their targetsto answer you question the one about how you are supposed to avoid conflict i can answer in one sentence to avoid pvp you must discourage people from seeing you as a target or an easy one at least some good advice i can give to this effect are become part of a badass corpalliance one who has people that will have no qualms retaliating for you build up a killboard go out into faction war a pirate group or something and kill some things having a decent killboard can usually discourage most lame wardecs and such fly cheap no faction mods no fancy ships generally nothing too horribly expensive or wouldnt be too painful to losereplace t2 stuff is okay fly smart want to avoid that suicide gate camp get a friend to scout you or you can make the gank unprofitable by not carrying too expensive of cargo hell try doing that mwdcloak trick it works pretty wellgetting back on track herenot supported
great idea
yes please
translation i cant argue with the truth so im gonna scream troll way to fail even more than your fail proposal
i would absolutely love to see this implemented i could imagine this being part of a low sec revamp expansion as i would like to suggest that these bounty agents only be available there fully supportededit im going to throw in my weight here with a suggestion several people have mention that this will not work unless the system is populated i agree if there are only a limited bounties available then people afking in stations or not logging in for awhile because they are on vacation etc will severely hamper the system another issue ive heard a lot on these boards mostly from carebears though tbh is that sec status doesnt mean enough and there are not enough draw backs from going evil what if the bounty missions were tied to sec status basically anyone who has a sec status of less than 10 gets automatically lumped into the agents mission pool just have concord the corporation that offers the bounties in low sec because sec status is your rep with concord the bounties could scale with sec status so that 100s are worth a lot more than 10 obviously as well as the option for people to increase the bounties for personal vendettas
up
supported this alone isnt the silver bullet needed to fix low sec but adding low sec regions between the empires and having factional warfare fight to protect the trade routes adds some good flavor and encourages people to venture out of the high sec safety zone many wont do it and will just hang out in caldari space but i still think its a good idea
1i am strongly against homogenization different regions should have meaninghere is an idea on similar grounds
yes
with this change you could add four new currencies unique to each empire each with a fluctuating exchange rate with the iskeverything sounds great except the diff empire currenciesfully support lowsec inbetween each empire this is something that lowsec really needs in addition to a major overhaul

added 2 big wins 1 fan favorite and a halfdozen or so bits of lowhanging fruit that were mentioned in a thread on a forum known to be frequented by bitter old vetsbig wins crowdsource and implement a complete redesign of overview filtering and presentation oh and multiple overview windows would be nice  yes we know it might reduce client fps let us decide about that tradeoff multiscreen multiwindow supportfan favorite two words control zlow hanging fruiti forget all of them but they are minor annoyances and bug fixes several of them relate to the directional scanner
yes
ok these images should show what i meanthe context menu from space with an option to clear the route clear or unset or something clear route may be betterplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe context menu from clicking on the triangle from the system name in the top left of the screen showing a new option to clear the route as well as hide it when the route is hidden i would expect the new option to still be presentplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswhether this needs to be included on selection of an item on your route in the overview or not i dont know

trade is way more stagnant in eve then it could potentially be why because every single region in nullsec has the same stuff why isnt there trade necessitated between the major powers this should be a huge aspect of empire building delve has x ore and we need it to build special ship t2 mod  rig  upgraded sov building we better trade with them but we have this stuff that is needed for special starbase stuff that make moon mining more profitable and unique mwd etc etcwhy not make every nullsec region have the same basic high end resources needed to build the basics but have different regions have different resources in different frequenciesfor example cloud ring has a huge abundance of resource y but in very rare frequencies resource x and no resource z at all but over there in deklein they have tons of z no x and a little y so they forge trade relationsthis would add layers of complexity goals and reasons for interaction and conflict in 00 instead of just sitting in your space mining everything you need for yourself haulers would have to be utilized to transport the massive amounts of ore generating traffic between regionscertain regions could be more desirable than others though this is true now it would be more meaningful and cause reasons for sov warfarewouldnt that be awesome if an enemy alliances war machine was built on their specific balance of resources and you could strike at specific points that are more valuable than othersthink  with baku oil fields in ww2 in fact back in the day ra controlled almost all the dysprosium in eve and invaded pure blind to try to get a full monopoly this is fun cool and dynamic stuffthink about it this way the global market and regional markets could fluctuate based on warspolitics in the universe the price of say a megathron could flucutate based on the political situation speculators could be a real professionblockading alliances and cutting of trade with their partners could be a strategy so could stopping their mining of a limited resourced the possibilities are endlessdont be scared of the fact that this would require an industry overhaul because a lot of things in eve need an overhaul this could single handedly well once the lag is fixed make the game fun againplease support this idea andor help iron out specifics
its called technetium you muppet
because everything would still be bought and sold in jita
are you trolling misunderstanding or agreeing with me alliances would still get monopolies and the geopolitical sov situation would cause prices to fluctuate
is not a bad idea but i hate speculators  
troll detected or you have no real clue as to how trade workseither way not supported
ok explain yourself or refrain from posting how would this not improve trade sov politics and the overall nullsec situation
and how is that relevant the point i regional diversification and an impetus for sov warfare the jita price would fluctuate if alliance a controlled all of x mineral or decided not to sell it at all then it would change if they got invaded by alliance b or failcascaded i think you didnt read the post
destroyers are probably the most wasted t1 ship in game there have been many threads on how to fix them but the answer is pretty simplecoercer1 mid2 low 90 pg 50 cputhis allows the coercer to use the highest teir frigate guns fit a small tank and actually have a usable mid slotcormorant50 optimal changed to 50 missile velocity per level7 missile hardpoints2 low1 mid20 cpu65 pgcatalistchange the falloff to a 5 rof bonus1 low2 mid75 pg 55 cputhrasher1 low2 med45 pg60 cpualso for all destroyers a 510 sig reduction and a 1015 boost to base speedthese changes actually put the ships in proper alignment as a midpoint between frigate and cruiser similar to how bcs are a midpoint from cruiser to bs the extra lows and mids allow for more diverse fittings and a small boost to tank while not making these ships uber hard to kill you know the current fitting system is sorta borked when most t1 frigates have similar or more lows and mids than the next teir up of ship
im not sure i understand how your proposed changes make dessies any better at lootingsalvaging
moar cpu moar pg moar salvagers
you should rename the thread making the few viable assault frigates pointlessdestroyers are fine not supported
destroyers are anything but fine their only real function is as a smalltime ratter and salvager what they need are a few variations  t2s and factions  with maybe a few minor adjustments to the t1s but i think this suggestion is a bit heavy since as you stated they would make the assault frigates pointless and more or less just as useless as the destroyer is nownot supported but only by a little bit sorry
and their pvp role which is antifrigate support apart from the cormorant which is admittedly a bit lacking they fill that role just fine if fitted properlyeven the cormorant can be used to some effect but thatd be stretching it i guess since you can train up the catalyst in a few hours and use pretty much the same support skillsimo the issue with destroyers is pretty much the same as with assault frigates people expect them to do things they are simply not meant to dojust take a look at fw they are used a lot and to great effect there and not just by rookie pilots but by seasoned veterans as well
im going to support this topic but with the understanding that i belive this changers should not be to tech 1 destroyers but add in tech 2s and fractions
they perform the role for which they were intended rather well small nimble can support 4 tractors and 4 salvagers with commendable ease once skilled properlybeyond that well mehthere have been threads upon threads upon threads concerning destroyers ever since the red moon expansion that buffed hit points of pretty much everything rendered them incapable of doing their slated job killing frigatessig too high by far hp too low for that sig cruiser sig frigate hpspeed too low to catch their intended targets or even keep upccp has stated that theyre so far down on the list of items to repair that well see them brought into line sometime around 2020 or sodestroyers are already fractional theyre 14 of a cruiser with 110th the survivability and pretty much the same damage output as a pair of tier 1 frigates only 13 as fastif you mean faction yeah would be nice as with faction bcs but no more likely than their repairs
op sounds cute in fleetssupported
probably not the best support reason but ill take it so now i support both my post and my cutenessassault frigates had an incredibly awesome fix when they got an ab boost on sisi no clue why ccp didnt end up implementing it destroyers are not fine currently i can fit out a punisher with reasonable dps similar or better tank with 2x the speed and half the sig radius of a cormorant and the same is pretty much true of every race destroyer destroyers are supposed to have awesome volley power but the best t2 range volley of any comes from a thrasher and its only 1100ish a punisher can absorb about 78 of those hits if its not already breaking the tracking not to mention it takes nearly 93 seconds per fire so thats nearly 1 minute of fire required just to kill a t1 frigate thats not filling the intended role at all destroyers are supposed to be high range high volley ships and they cannot even fit range guns without totally gimping themselves they need more fitting so they can actually fit the best frigate class guns they need more slots so they can actually fit a tank that can be better than most t1 frigates not to mention the above other helpful buffs theres not one thing listed above that going to tell everyone and their brother omg destroyers are op lets all go fly them but those buffs will help actually make the ships worthy of use and add a bit more interest and diversity to the gamethe only reason the thrasher is a useful destroyer is because it has solid close range dps using the very easy to fit auto cannons and an ability to fit a few shield buffs no other race can even achieve close to the same dps and tank similar sig or speed most of them struggle to even look competently fit when using the lowest teir of guns because their fittings are so borked its just rough to do anything useful
the role of the destroyer class ship is to destroy frigates in that role they excel if used properlytherefor it is my opinion that destroyer class ships are not broken thus there is nothing to fix not supported

ok ok first of all this isnt a rant about skills taking too long or anything like that completely different in fact regardless im sure some people still arent going to like itminingpirattingmissions to some extentwhat do these four things have in common well they all make isk and theyre all trivially easy to do in order from quite possibly the worst offenders to notquitetheworst all of these gameplay elements promote macro usage and why because computers are great at repetitive tasks that humans have no real desire to do but why then should these tasks be in a game its my belief at least that any kind of gameplay that promotes macros is one that needs to be looked atas far as suggestions to fix it i dont have a whole lot beyond something needs to fill the void but ive got a bit of one for mining at least probably one of the most heavily macroed tasks until the pi powergamers get theirs writtenfor mining at least i would propose that all asteroids contain more than one type of ore that can be extracted similar to real mining and depending on what type of ore youre looking for you would scan for concentrations of that ore and play a little minigame to get that kind of ore out not doing it correctly would yield less ore but it would require semiconstant attention to do it right and would hopefully take some skill to do instead of more mindless clicking yields would probably need to be boosted somewhat to make up for the increased effort and inevitable decline of miners who can no longer run 8 boxes or macro the thingrare ore concentrations are much lower or nonexistent inside of hisec and mining crystals give a bonus to that ore type only for example it might be possible to grab some of the ore you dont want if you dont focus the laser correctly and the crystal would only bonus one type
the fleet finder introduced in dominion is a very conveniento tool for quickly assembling a fleet no need for xing up no need to post adverts in chat with the fix to the standingsbased fleet in tyrannis it also became much easier to usein my corp we find it useful to keep a fleet advert up all the time so people who log on can join fleet inmediately and so help each other if requiredhowever its behaviour is still somewhat annoying in several situations where it should not be when limiting the fleet by standings the finder uses the higher value of the standings range so if you set the fleet to let in people with excellent deep blue standings the game will only let in people with 10 standings and keep out 8 same with light blue standings solution make the fleet finders cutoff standings 01 and 51 respectively every time you change your standings to anyone your advert is removed and you are prompted for a new one  the problem is that in tyrannis adding someone to your address book or removing them counts as a standings change this makes no sense from the players point of view and can become very annoying if you add someone to the book for intel reasons solution do not reset the advert when the fleet boss standings change when you are left as the last person in the fleet the fleet finder automatically removes your advert and asks for a new one since the system allows a 1man fleet with an advert i dont see the need for this sometimes the fleet boss goes afk everyone else logs off and when the boss comes back there is no advert and a new fleet has been started solution do not reset the advert when there is just one person left in the fleet

again despite the fact that pvp is enabled everywhere in eve as long as youre undocked but you cant run a production chain on a hostile battleship that has you scrammedabsolutely everywhere in team fortress ii has the ability for medics to heal team members does this mean that tf ii is not a pvp game
zso and habaticus have the right of it eve is better thought of as a sandbox with pvp not a pvpsandbox a few thoughts some have referred to this sandbox with pvp as a space simulator a spacebased virtual world or a cosmos whatever one calls it the point is to distinguish between divergent understandings of what eve is or should be to be fair from what i gather from old players and past documentation the balance between pvpsandbox and a sandbox with pvp has been evolving over time this admits for legitimate disagreement as to the exact role of pvp in eve even so eve is increasingly rich in nonpvp possibilities and playerswhether eve is a cosmos or not is the root presupposition that drives much of what people have to say here and how we interpret the views of others for example it help explains much of the drama over ank  she is antipvp and antieve it helps explain the selfprivileging claim that some of us get eve while others do not and it help explains the responses to various proposals in assembly hall in the end the view taken by ccp is a policy decision that will drive the development and refinement of eve over time player outlooks may help shape this policy via the csm ccps monitoring of the forums and eventually competition from alternative spacebased virtual worlds and therein lies the importance of the distinctionthe pvpsandbox is a narrow vision that constrains the development of eve the sandbox with pvp is an expansive vision with far greater possibilities id prefer ccp pursue the expansive vision in a way that keeps its pvp edge as well as generates the fixes and enhancements to eve we all know are required delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom

first off i understand the whole sabotage aspect of the game and think it should remain however with the recent disbanding of uk i find myself asking why do they instantly lose sovwhy should an alliance instantly lose control of a solar system just because they no longer have an alliance ticker next to their name its not like all of uk just vanished once the spy clicked the button so why isnt there some type of failsafe for things like this i just have a really hard time understanding how an alliance can be completely lost and lose all control when all they really lost was a labelfrom a different povif someone were to steal my identity it doesnt mean my only option is to roll over and die i am still me and there are options to regain what was taken from me chiefly the person who stole my identity cant just come into my home and call it his home without getting stabbed or shot in the face allowing me to regain my identity or at least maintain control of my homeon a side note you cant tell me that these sudden freak alliance disbandings are completely motivated by ingame politics im willing to be all i have that most of them are done by pricks in real life who simply dont like the other players because they are in a different alliance these are considered out of game factors and adversely affect the proper game politics imo
so youre saying that if i disband your alliance because i think in real life that you have a terrible alliance i should be banned but if i disband your alliance because my in game character doesnt like your alliance then everything is kosher
thanks guys keep it comingha now thats asking too much kiddin that would be great
im going to go out on a limb herewhile i do agree that the black ops need some kind of buff i dont think it should be the ability to use a covert cloakimho the role of the black ops is primary the ability to move covert ships around via jump portals however the issue there is the low risk associated with a covert ops hotdrop the aggressor has the initiative to pick that low risk moment to spring a hot drop on a target the inability of a black ops to warp around cloaked means that there is a risk associated with using them an example being to rescue stranded covert ships in a camped system the buffs i would be looking at is fuel consumptionfuel capacity and jump ranges the jump portal is a blackops one unique feature and it is there you should be looking to buff it

added to the low hanging fruit list
the proposal is merely that a proposed statement by the csm if the other members of the csm do not agree with the wording it will be changed after debate during the meetingi have come to a considered conclusion on this issue based on all the evidence available to me at this time if you provide additional evidence i will reconsider my conclusions in light of the new informationps the mention of bitter old vets in the proposal is an example of an extremely advanced concept that you are clearly unfamiliar with here is a wikipedia link that may be helpful
i would like to see the following added to the cons list to correctly represent much of the feedback that has been given removes a level of depthchoiceconsequence from character development that many feel are a featurebenefit and not a problem
i did not realize that a proposal going before the csm was the place for a satirical comment i thought it was serious spaceship business  my bad guess my belief that csm is supposed to be doing serious spaceship business for the playerbase is incorrect then
problem is both sides are doing that in either casethe biggest problem still lies in the nearly mandatory need to skill at least a bit into the learning skillsyes there are strategical thoughts about it but those only come into play a lot later i havent skilled the learnings fully nad now my current skill plan would take 2 month longer than if i had skilled them further but to be honest after more than 40 million sp there isnt that much importance in squeezing out the last drop of sphour at least to meheh i lost far more training time when i went away from eve while still paying for my accountand just a few more thoughts to ponderif learnings get removed as certain  uncertain you feel it is and no attribute change would compensate this the efective value of imps is going to rise a lot getting 5 attribute on top of 15 is a very nice bonus but getting it on top of 5 doubles it an attribute compensation seems to me necessary so the gap between those being able to pay for 5s and those not being able wouldnt widen too muchmy alt chars two of them both on hiatus due to financial status atm have by far better leranings than my main reason is i could more easily plan those skills and wasnt in any hurry or need to get anything i could actually play eve with my main while my alts slowly got their learning skills and that is to me the biggest pro for removing the learnings alt chars have it by far easier to actually gain those learnings than first chars ever will they are the only ones that can really spend the time in the beginning to maximize the learnings because the play is happening on another account
worst idea ever
just remember guys 89 of statistics are made up and the 6 studies i got that data from agree and no i cant link you to the studiesnot approved in the least
i would like to suggest a slightly different solution to this problem its essentially no different that the original posters however old vets with all 5s in learning skills would suffer no loss wipe all the learning skills kill the points gained in each attribute from the learning skills kill that 10 learning modifier from learning then change the skill points per hour formulacurrently the skill points per hour are calculated as followsskill points  60primary attribute  30secondary attributechange it to the followingskill points  990  66primary  33secondaryif you are a veteran and managed to max out your learning skills you would see no slow down to learning new skills if you have any less you would be upgraded to veteran status the other advantage to this comes when you plug in cyber or play with your attributes in the restat screen if you plug in a level 5 cyber you will not see your skill jump by 55 when you add and subtract a point from your attribute in the restat screen you will see your ending attribute gain and lose a single point the original posters suggestion would have this effectcryptic math followssp  60p  30sp  p1011 primaryskill10 points from learning  10 for the learning skills  s1011 sp  60p1011  30s1011sp  66p10  33s10sp  66p  660  33s  330sp  990  66p  33s

i do appologise if there is already a thread for thisi was thinking that eve gate could have personalcorpally killboards incorperated into itit seems like the perfect place for it it would also get people using eve gate alot more because at the minute it seems like its not used to its full potentialjust a thought would be awesome if it can be done though 
this is a good idea and i support it unfortunately ccp has stated previously that they have no intention of hosting any official killboards so i doubt this will ever happen also this sort of feature doesnt really attract new players like incarna or dust or pi will so it would never make it onto ccps new agenda
if ccp doesnt want to host kbs for whatever reasonbit silly imo they could easyly work with someone else like battle clinic for one who would host killboards considering eve gate is basicaly a copy of facebook it would be just like creating an app that players who wanted to use would install on there own gate ccp then wouldnt need to host anything they just need to make it workim no expert but it cant be that complicated
not supporting anything that improves spacebookits a total waste of developer time and they should be focusing on fixingpolishing the game and not there bloody spacebook that no one really usesas for why ccp wont do the kb one of those reasons im willing to bet good isk is the fact they consume an obscene amount of hard drive space in just functionality alonemy forum boards dont even consume that much for crying out loud my host provider has a 100mb cap on db storage the kbs i tried to host consumed half of that space in just the first week alone it was for an alliance and they were busy busy indeedand for people who dont understand what goes into webhosting thats an considerable amount of storage space to take up my forum boards have many many posts and they hover around 5 to 10mb after 2 to 3 years of service just to give you a rough ideanow i didnt look into what took that space up it never made sense but i have a feeling that would be one of those reasonsbut yeah spacebook has some nice features but i can live without them and safely say its a security risk waiting to go off
seeing as they are fragile enough as it is i think it would make sense to at least give them the interdiction nullifier as a role bonus
for those of us who dont have 50 inch wide monitors playing at 9001x9001 resolution we cant afford to have the ship type column on our overviews a mile wide this often causes problems with the stabber and stabber fleet issue as the stabber fleet issue will only show up as stabber causing people ie me to attack them thinking its just some ty little stabber only to see it pop 5 drones and instapop them with 40k ehp thanks
make it a little bigger so you can see stabber f or you could show info before you start attacking
yeah ccp this dude right here was playing eve on his netbook  dude the small version with 1 inch screen and 1x1 resolution yeeeeeaaah dude he smoked pot last night and go pvp in a bantam  and omfg he been popped  so unfair ccp and now hes sad his  technique is all over the place  cmon ccp do this dude justice  rename all ships to republic ships 
we talked about this awhile ago and after living in 00 for awhile now i would have to say noits just that much more of a risk to lose all your stuff and that could completely bankrupt people very fastimagine having 50b worth of bpos in an outpost you go on vacation and are away for a week thinking everything is all good then you come back to find out that the outpost all your stuff was in got blown up and all of those bpos are gonesure you could leave expensive things like that in an npc station but when you live in deep 00 you dont have any npc stations and you need stations to leave your ships fuel moon goo etci think the ability to conquer the station and deny docking rights to people is more than enough atleast that way you still technically own your items you just cant really get em out of the station
out of pure interest and a sudden ideahow would you stay to the point of having 1 main outpost per constelation that is indestructuable while every other outpost in the constellation can be treated as suggested by zendorenthis way you can keep the more unique stuff safe and stil have the ability to keep your capitals split between several constellation to not end in a lockdown by the enemy camping a single stationas for the medical clone thing i dont like the npc only option exspecial in deepspace its a pain to get there i would rather prefer an option that sends you to the closest indestructable outpost your alliance owns  if none is there to empire however you would stil have cloning bay issues if you are on a low sp clone and the safe outpost gets taking over while your on holiday  you cant use the medical bay a free jumpclone in empire could fix thatas for the last idea i would like something like a capital salvaging system just so that an attacker can do continously damage by removing the station fully say after a timer of xx days when they leave the station behind their own battlelines
a outpost cost around 20  40 bil to create losing a asset like that and a way to control the area docking  contolling is a big loss on its selve i like the out of the box idea but its a little bit to much
well let me try to bring arguments against thatmotherships  decent fitting cost 20b yet a lot people not in spaceholding alliances have them and their number is continously increasing sure unlike a station they can be hidden but see the positive side people acctualy would commit in groups for this asset which means there would be more fightsif half your alliance were afk would it be fair to hold those outposts against equal strike forces just because if they take something you will take it again the next time you have a bigger fleet as disposal with less possible lossessure you can bring timezones as an argument but ccp inventeded several timer in the new sovereign system if a station could be put in this miserable state after the first timer it would surely force the attacker to show up on more occasions than its nowbut to come back on the cost factor zendoren said himselfso the cost will allready be less anyway when the outpost is just in a burned out state i would prefer total anhilation through aslong as theres a reasonable safe hub per constelation as described above psure it hurts to loose something but eve was never ment to be a save haven so given more opportunity for people to fight exspecial with the current state of 00 as this idea does would be a decent thingon a sidenode also have a look at newer eve alliances people wanna accomplish something and building an outpost if you arent a long time spaceholder is something if you make them destructable sure people will be hurt but other people also will have joy in reconstructing their own fortune againas for your docking controlling point smelly bait i am not sure if you mean docking as a mean to control the local space or as controlling the docking but1 if its the earlier i would say you simple have the same chances as the attacker and can just as him use pos to keep your fleet close by evening chances is not a bad thing2 if its the later zendoren also said that everyone is able to dock so dominating the space arround the station would be a mean in itself and just another mean for combati am starting to become all for it 
agreed with last post that isi find the excuse of losing valuables is no different and rather carebearishly pathetic then getting a jf blown up by a gank fleet carrying goods people lose that kind of crap all the time every daythat is the costrisk for the privilege of holding 00 territory as it should be this is eve online people why stop it the inevitable doomif your going to go afk for a long period of time have the brains enough to store these goods someplace where they can be retrieved and thats just the top of a long list of solutions to make sure your stuff is safethe whole point of 00 is its conquerable space its not supposed to be safe i think the danger of 00 to alliances who hold outposts is not high enoughoutposts that are built and become permanent fixtures will continue to grow in numbers and litter dozens if not soon hundreds of systems in the not too distant futureits rather easy to make isk down there if you know what your doing and i do mean a crapload of isk mind youi dont mind the idea of an single outpost in a region being flagged as an hq but there should be a cost to that and it should be unflaggable if its conquered
this gets a bump every couple of days and every time it gets bumped more people give it a thumbs uponly one person has not given it a thumbs up and the claim that npc stocks reduce the need to click excessively also uses the clicking as an excuse to keep the market from getting swamped the odd thing about the comments people are doing pi the npc items only make a fraction of the pi items that need to be made not to mention when those stockpiles run out people will have to be clicking a thousand times a day the second point out keeped the market scarce by introducing a human bottleneck is weak in my opinion you still have logistics to content with which should be the only human bottleneckhaving a function in game that is targeted toward low entry low cost is all well and good it should bring in more people but having that function the mega click fest that pi is is just extremely poor example being set for new playershey i tried that eve game when i started playing i had to do1 hunt rats in 0810 system getting me between 5k and 10k a rat2 sit out at a belt for hours on end in my mining n00b ship mining veldspar3 when i finally got enough isk to buy some skills for industry i trained skills for three weeks getting up planetary interaction4 i then clicked my mouse over a thousand times to setup a couple of planets to give me some passive income while i mine and ratconclusion eve is a click or wait fest you either have to wait for everything to get done or click things hundreds of times to get anywhereis that the example ccp wants to set for new players as old players say to new players that ask whats a good way to make some passive isk the old players say planetary interaction has a low capital and skill requirements and can make some passive iskdont force new subscribers to click hundreds of time it sets a bad example and for those of us that love eve it just one more thing to hate
to be honest i really hope they prenerved pi as they did with so many other thingsthe possible upgrades are pretty awesome which amarr player wouldnt want their own temperate planet making slaves i just need to wait for them oh and hopein the mean time reducing the amount of micromanagement so we can focus on the fun parts of micromanagement would be a very nice movei have already given my thumbs up so i wont add another one but i want to underline the issue of removing ui blocks of the pi for a bot it doesnt matter if it clicks one time or a hundred times to me it doesperhaps another possible upgrade would be to be able to drop an existing command center over an old one thus replacing the old one with the new while keeping the rest of the infrastructure the same not to save any isk but to remove another ui block that keeps me from the fun parts of micro management

and this is where we come full circle in this discussion eve is a game and not real life ergo the rules will not be the same what you are experiencing are mechanics designed by the developers to ensure that there is no safe place in the game ie everything has risks involved in it either through npcs or by players while at the same time giving you enough of a chance to play the odds and risk in your favor if you are smart enoughthe pirates who suicide gank they are allowed to do so because they are willing to accept the penalties involved in their criminal acts and they plan accordingly the people who are the targets of pirates they also have the means to mitigate risk and stay out of harms way means which i explained in my previous post which i feel you didnt read in its entiretyso to you i pose a question your playstyle is your playstyle the same can be said for the pirates or the people in the nullsec alliances why should your playstyle be safer than others
noany credibility you might have had which wasnt that much you blew away with your responses to topics replies
actually eve is even harsher on criminal than real lifeyou know in real life even if is hard in some place you can actually avoid the policerepercussion without being banned by god
i hear there is this game called second life which imitates real if you want realistic i suggest you play a game like that as flying around in space behind a collapsed wormhole from earth in space with waterworld gravity and physics is not at all realisticalso you keep talking about losing your mission ship in a mission in high sec i know a lot of mission runners and only 1 ever lost a ship to suicide ganking which was at a gate on autopilot you are either using stupidly expensive fits to compensate for your inability to fit ships or you are just lying because there are a bazillion working t2 fits that are not even remotely worth suicide ganking
thatd be fine as long as we have more realistic cops as wellyou know ones that arrive within 14 hours if they come at all and leave you feeling like youre the one at fault then they tell you that theres less than a 5 chance theyll ever catch the perptwo weeks later they arrest the closest minmatar hoping to find a quarter dose of mindflood on him and he gets a 3 month suspended sentence meanwhile youve been robbed twice more and the police never do anything about those two because hey they already warned you right
i dont support this but if it were reversed wed see the lowsec and 00 people cry just as bad that is if lowsec or null would have rats that would explode and destroy your ship if they got near you and shooting them first would cause superrats to spawn and vaporize your ship for doing soim not a fan of gaming security rules like the current suicide ganking does its disproportionately penalizing industrial ships because it prevents them from fighting back in any way through escorts it also prevents retribution through using alts kill rights are meaningless if all you use are dessie gank alts or cheap bs fitsso i dont support the op but i would like to see it balanced a little better

dont fly what you cant afford to lose that is one of the most important rules of this gamehigh sec is not safe never has been never will bei feel safer in null sec than i do in high sec if you do not like the way the game is leave now because what you want changed will never change ccp would lose more customers than they would gain if they were to even consider it
this is an interesting topic because messenger001 is trying to get ccp to fix an issue your issue is that high sec is not safe enough and you dont want to lose that pretty pve ship of yourspoints to make you aware and reiterate since some of these fine pvpers have already pinged on some of these itemspirates and criminals will gank you the mechanic is high sec is safer not safe criminals arent restricted to back alleys and ghettos they will come into your house and kill you this is internet spaceships its serious and realisticthere are consequences to criminal acts just like with most anything you commit a crime and you lose privilegesinsurance has been changed and blows now for gankers that is a poor justification for a dev to focus on your issuethis is a sandbox you can play in the corner of it with your toys but eventually a bigger kid might come over beat you up and take it watch the trailers that is what ccp sales youthe major powerblocks and 00 have been trying to get devs to focus on more important things like game performance dont cloud focus with this trivial nonsense instead of viewing new eden by high security low security null security with standardized threat levels and protective measures look at it like thishigh security kinda like the burbs or major city main street in some instances threat is minimal in comparison to a ghetto or back alley but you can still get mugged assaulted or killedlow security more like the ghettos and back alleys small time crooks and gangs will ravage you if you arent careful and aware null security wild wild west no holds barred outlaws run rampant and personal governments are formed with their own rules and regulations no control by big brother and major gang wars are alive and kicking except when it lags which ccp may eventually acknowledgeif you look at it that way and take the proper precautions youll be fineproclus diadochuruke coordinatorvarion galacticown alliance ncnc nation best nation and posting in a widot thread
if youve been ganked in a mission in high sec its because you were trying to do it afk or you werent paying attention to your scanner or grid this is the lazy aspect or you were flying in a very expensivefactionofficer fit missioning ship if you dont want to be suicided in your missioning ship you need to be diligent or run your missions in a less expensive ship there are many ways you can go about staying safe when running missions in high sec you just have to be smart and not lazy about it i run plexes on occassion in null sec and havent been killed because i take care not to get caught i pay attention to my on board scanner i stay alignedif you want a game that affords you places where you are completely safe you need to find another game eve was never intended to be that kind of game there is risk and reward everywhere in new eden and that is how it is supposed to beits not a bug or an exploit this is how the game was intendedthey die and take a sec hit they have to be smart and patient often waiting hours and hours to find the right target they have to contend with other people trying to snatch their targets and the wrecks out from under themsuiciding can be fun but its also not instant gratificationalso lets not forget that ccp did just make it less profitable with the insurance nerf
i like the suicide mechanic ianasb maybe keep insurance as is but repeat offenders would be blacklisted by pend no no no might as well redo the graphics to be elves and wizardsits not always for profit mostly for lulz killmails tears etc overall these ideas are not in line with the eve gestalt no support
very interesting idea im working on some tweaks to the system as proposed mainly due to the fact i only really thought about the essence of the idea rather than the actual meat and several good points have been raised im going to see if i can include this with it more later 
very clever idea i quite like itslight tweak perhapsi dont think there would be as many bounty hunters if the agents didnt stick to giving out contracts on pilots within a certain limit if jumps like 25if there are no targets with bounties within 25 jumps there simply arent any misions available out of courtesy the agent may refer you to the nearest agent that does have a targetalso i hope that several bounty hunters would be hunting for the same targetyou would get a frustrating message like altaen has cashed in on this bounty you were too slowive got another target for yousee me when you get a chancethis would make the profession more competitive would create rivalries reputations infamy etc
i thought about this being a potential issue as well but then i figured that it actually should be an integral part of the bounty hunting profession with the ability to add anyone to your contact book thus knowing when they are online you can easily monitor a marks playing habits and with locator agents you can pinpoint any player in the galaxy i also think it might be technically quite difficult as players can be highly mobile across the galaxy
not a bad idea at all another would be to have all killrightgeneratingkills create the lowest tier of bounty mission regardless of whether the victim files it with an agent or not if a bounty hunter collects on this you lose killrights immediately so killrights would more or less be a bounty mission that every victim would recieve unless they chose to up the ante and put it on the bounty market for more than the basebounty also to populate the system in the beginingyou simply convert all existing bounties into bounty missions
fair enough maybe distance shouldnt be a factori fly almost every night for me day from 01000500 i almost never ever see entire corporations worth of my alliance mates because their active shift is wholly comprised of the time that i am at workif i wanted to hunt a bounty that was asleep for 100 of my available flying time i would be quite frustrated if there was any negative impact of cancelling an assigment once i discovered i would never be able to complete itsolutions maybe only give an assigment for a target that is active when you request the assigmenti dont think you should make it easy to cancel an assigment that would promote cherrypicking convenient easy or lowskilled targetsi suppose this issue would make it more important to send multiple hunters after each target and have no penalty if someone simply completes the assigment before you do
thanks additionally it has the benefit of offering the mark the person who has a bounty on their head a legitimate way of working off their bounty by grinding sec status as far as autotransferring kill rights while i do agree there needs to be a way to auto populate the system to keep it full of bounties across the galaxy i hesitate to support this simply because you are taking something away from a player the kill rights there are probably plenty of players out there who enjoy those kill rights and would prefer to use them themselves i would not want to take that way from them i do agree with transferring all existing bounties over to any new system if it were to be implemented though
i can see the problem but at the same time having an easy route to dropping targets could lead to more abuse of the systemremember that the idea is to actually make a bounty worth something to the victim rather than the target itselfmaybe timezones could be considered in some way but that sounds an awful lot of work and in itself could lead to the same abuse as abovealternately the missions could time out after x period of time and having x missions active should mean you find a target
i really dont think it should be the onus of the system to make it easy for the bounty hunterdo you think boba fett would turn down a contract because han solo lived in a different time zone i think bounty hunting should be a strenuous and tasking profession for anyone to take up i mean look at that dogg buy on tv hes not your normal dude amiriteif the mark is really worth it to you you should be willing to alarm clock it people in 00 alarm clock all the time for reinforcement timers im not trying to shoot down ideas im trying to work constructively with you guys because i would love to see a system work for bounty hunting but i want to caution against making it too accessible and easy for themedit i guess the op needs to ask himself whether he sees bounty hunting as a profession that any casual player can take up or if it might need to be reserved for more dedicated players
anything is better than bounties at the moment  supportedhowever there is a simpler way of getting the system at the moment to approach something resembling a fully thought out piece of game design1 make kill rights able to be traded2 make it so the maximum bounty you can claim is the cost of the bounty targets clone at the time of poddingsimple easy and should make it a lot harder to exploit the bounty system to make a profit when youre the one with a bounty on your head
i like this idea a lot there are portions of it i would quibble with reward size for one but by and large it has a lot in common with my own thoughts on the subjectthats one of the most ridiculous statements ive ever read why should any profession be reserved for more dedicated players we all pay the same fee each month in order to play this game why should people who have a job wife and children be excluded from some part of the game simply because they cannot be online at odd hours of the dayyou want something special for being online all day youve got it you can run missions until your eyes burn out explore sites immediately after downtime and spin your ship for hours on end
i completely disagree with you i dont think this is ridiculous or even unprecedented can a casual player run an alliance can a casual player even manage a network of poses for an alliancehave you actually flipped through the eve online career guidethere are many within that are obviously reserved for players with more time to play the game than othersnot everything in the game needs to be designed with the lowest common denominator in mindbounty hunting is one of those things id like to see avoid the blizzard mo edit i read your blog thingy and your ideas seem very much inline with this thread i think you are highly overreacting about my statement and perhaps even taking it out of context the point im trying to make is that the bounty mission system should not hold the bounty hunters hand and only give them missions that are in the bhers region playtime and timezone a bounty hunter needs to be willing to cross vast amounts of space and perhaps be prepared to log in on off hours if they want to hunt a decent bounty
overreacting perhaps but these are the eveo forums and they feed off drama and overreaction right maybe there is a precedent for reserving professions for dedicated players you know like grinding up experience in wow or something but does that really make it fun in the end isnt it about fun eve is not nor should it be a second job my two tag lines are pvp is fun and it should be encouraged wherever possible and eve is a game and it should be fun not a second job youll see this theme wherever i write anythingedited for clarity i disagree with magnus and not the ops suggestionand i still disagree with you magnus in my opinion bounty hunting serves two purposes content and retribution the content is for the bounty hunter when you log in you should be able to do something so ask for an assignment and you should get one within a reasonable distance and the guy should be online the primary worries for the bounty hunter should be is the target docked and not doing anything is the target flying a ship i cant handle do i have to circumnavigate dangerous space that may be blocked by the targets acquaintances its not worth it to expend days worth of effort moving two regions away from your normal base of operations with a ship only to find out the target has changed professions and is a permanently docked marketing alt this should be content which makes the game funthe second reason behind bounty hunting is retribution revenge for the guy who got killed this can only really be served if the target is likely to be killed if we do no hand holding at all target could be anywhere including 00 and may be a completely different time zone from the hunter then the target is not likely to be killed we have to add that likelihood
bear in mind that a target mission can be given to multiple people at the same time increasing the chances of retribution considerablygood point on the profession change to daytrader or hell even titan prisoner i will give that some more thought

so your idea is that in space vast empires with their own policenavyand a unified security force concord allow the borders to be controlled by pirates sounds like the empires and concord thought that through really well if they wanted isolationism which would go against concords mission and own interests in collecting trade fees etc im sure the economic interests of the empires and their member corporations would also be suffering too cause cutting off highsec routes would be the way to do that different currency what is the deal with trying to go backwards in time will we have to physically carry our precious metals to trade at stations or can we keep using the electronic credits and other futuristic methods of buying and sellingnot supported
the reason why isk was created in the back story is because theyre is to much currency they needed one for interstellar trade so in rp its make no sense to go back in a gameplay sense for most people multiple currency fluctuation economic news saving in multiple currency changing a currency for another ect are boring if not downright irritating and unlike other aspect of eve you cant simply ignore it its will be shoved down your throat every time you will use moneywell some ganker gonna cry to see their nice bottleneck disappear but i love the idea i alway found isolated highsec like solitude really interesting most people live only in one nationregion anyway what population most player live around trade hub already your idea i love it but its will actually make it harder for people to move in less populated area worse there is a risk that people abandon more costly nation for the one with better price
i love this idea dsupported
woah  supported
i hope it is appropriate to plug my own proposal in here it received enthusiast and nearly unanimous support i estimate the implementation time to be under 5 minutes no kidding

here is a bit of low hanging fruit 1 when arranging scan probes in the system map let us have a black backgroundthe funky luminous nebulae often hide the probes celestials etc when you are trying to scan something or someone especially in the latter case time is of the essence and it sucks to not be able to even see your probe handles or the celestials in the system2 when displaying the 00 regional market ffs give the system as well as the name of the station  dont make us do 34 clicks to find out where every single item for sale is
yes
move that drag and drop of bookmarks into chat windows and email to number 1 this is too long overdue were supposed to be x years into the future and we cant relay universal positions to each other apart from writing them on paper and dropping them in a can whats the back story of how we lost that ability
addedccp is working on a new font its in the minutes probably best to wait and see what they come up withps helvetica is the one true fontaddedok guys deadline for adding new stuff to the list is downtime tomorrow then well start with the prioritization
no worries the ui is my pet peeve with the game  im currently traveling or id have done more than just vomit a bunch of links down your direction but ill be happy to take a more constructive look this weekend or seeing your deadline help with prioritization i might have doubts as to the usefulness of this but we wont know if we dont try
when a probe scanner is open give us a shortcut a for analyse excelent effort good job csm
the ability to turn off the ugly nebulas at least until they are replaced with something that doesnt interfere with the gui and is less ugly would be great and wouldnt seem to require a lot of dev time

very cool idea i think it should have been like that at the start it will make lowsec less barren and boring too
interesting ideawith the talk of objectives for small gangs going around lately i think this could qualify if a structure is under attack perhaps it could send an sos in local as a beacon in space or something so people could come defend it watch it get blown upalso i know its not the forums and its not eve official but one of our csm representatives mynxee has set up a web site for presenting and voting on ideas to improve lowsecurity space
very cool concept
instead of having a big poslike force field it would be cool if the shanty towns looked more like the collection of structures you see in agent missions seed a blueprint for the reactor structure which already has a model and use that to provide powergrid and cpu but no force field other starbase structures including gunewar batteries could then be linked to the reactor structure any structure could be attacked at any time without having to bash down a shield first multiple reactors could be used for larger shanty townsalso it would be cool if we could anchor these anywhere in space and not just next to moons a criminal shanty town cranking out boosters seems like it ought take more effort to find than just checking out a bunch of moons

a lot of people simple have the dysprosium of the early days in mind it was bottlenecked so hard that the alliances which controled it had massive income and huge capital fleets before others while constantly selling it in jita for ridicolous pricessure it gave opportunity for freighter suiciding but in the end all people had to do was control the moons so it would certainly be helpful if you were writing in which form ressource x would be spawned exspecial if you consider the use of ninja operationsalso keep in mind that people will continously  about prices and ccp will do the same as with high end moonminerals and invent something like alchemy for ressource x to eventualy construct it with y amount of ressource zpersonaly i however think that making regions more unique is a great idea and would even go so far to give different kinds of space different attributes that effect ships like wormholes allready do that way every nullsec entity would also be more unique by maybe specializing their people in certain ships that have more use in the space they ownyet to really change 00 first of all the lag needs to be fixed nothing makes people want to pvp less than constantly staring at a black screen or warping in onto the enemy just to not see him due to overview not loading and being shot by invisible enemysafter that we can discuss the sense of grinding 4 times as attacker while the defender has to show up only a single time to ruin your dayan overhaul of sovereign mechanics should be done again the thinking of breaking sovereign into different states was very good by ccp as an attacker would surely be willing to bring it when he saw progress staring at timers however is not any different from training skills and no exciting content at allsince you are so much into graphics ccp why not give the different structures in system unique stuff like plasmaclouds leaking from them if they are heavy damaged or from tcu if sovereign is about to break i mean its not like the lag could get any worse than it is nowbut to come back on your basic ideatrade can also be bad right now we allready have ingame coalitions that by themself own 7 regions or more and in addition have friends on a case to case basis those would surely trade with each other but it seems a bit missing the idea of conflict surely 1 entity would like to control ressource x but if this entity can trade a certain amount of ressource x against ressource y held by a buddy there would be no conflict eitherso rather than simply adding ressources region depending there should also be some sense of conflict i very much like yourand i think if ccp would introduce different kinds of space that effect certain ships it could be very valueable this way you for example couldnt just get the special t2 mod that works anywhere in providence no you could get that t2 mod in providence that works super awesome in tenalbasicly it would be stretching things apart and you could ballance it by close to empire regions producing less valueable or less minerals which are needed in a deepspace region and deepspace maybe producing things that can be used in empire too to have the risk vs reward thinkingtrade would be there non the less but the stretching would hopefully work against the constant forming of spacebuddy  hes in my neighbouring region i have to like him  coalitionsyet also the other people in this thread are right if something is rare and unique people will simply as it is sell it on jita market to make an easy coin so what matters a lot is supply and demandbut all in all change is needed to make things move again which definatly is a thumbs up
sounds a lot like what you want is the same way moons are setup now in eve technetium which 90 of it is owned by nc because its in their space theyve monopolized the price they make 13 of the isk cost of any t2 ship if not more hell they make so much isk right now that they can afford to have pandemic legion wage war for them now honestly you do the same to ore in this game and alliances will make ore so expensive the economy would collapse what economy we have now what we need to do is shuffle the moons give every region a mix the result would be a more realistic balance of assets resulting in the game being more balanced
ok your opinion is the opposite of correct shuffling up everything would make the game even more stagnant see we want things to be less stagnant lag notwithstanding people should take space from the nc if they want to change the prince of technetium
your implying trade is a major part of whether this game is stagnant or not im saying it is little to no relevance on if the game is stagnant what people are doing in the game and im not talking the day to day events but the major events that keep the game in motion you know what keeps sov the way it is alliances having such large fleets that they cant be crushed in a realistic time nc and sc could literally be in a war for a year and never be at stress for lack of capital ships of any size you think trade is going to somehow put 00 back in motion
what about dispersing trade by limiting the number of transactions that a single station can handle in one day or limit the transaction rate of a single station eg purchases per minuteadd a sovereignty structure which boosts the transaction rate of stations in the system affected by the structure or add a station module to add more transactions per minute to that stationthis would directly compete for a slot with other sov structures npc stations would have transaction upgrades if they are logistics stations so eg assembly plants would not have transaction upgrades pull the cap and trade trick cap transactions at some incredibly high value such as double all current jita trade start ramping it down from therethe short term effect might simply be that trade moves to other stations in jita or to perimeterthere need to be other restrictions to easy rapid trasport of goods 30 jumps from point of production to jita 44 perhaps transaction limits on gates so border gates have higher throughput than region gates which have higher throughput than system gates the effect would be similar to the 1000pilotlimit in jita some time back but the impact would be on number of ships per minute as opposed to absolute volume of pilots in space id start off with border gates handling as many ships per hour as is seen for all gates in jita combined during that systems busiest times with regional and system gates providing 13 and 19th that figure respectivelywe cant solve transit problems by removing bookmarks around gates and removing wtz so we have to find other creative ways of simulating the tyranny of distance
so because powerblocs have such large fleets there should never be a reason to fight gamewise you sir are truly a visionary pack your bags i suspect ccp will need you in iceland full time as the head of their genius creative person division
so instead of trying out an idea that might changes things you prefer keeping the things they are please if you detest an idea give a better on or change it slightly and give it a try sure it can end either way quiet good as invention or horrible aweful like the new sovereign grindyet keep in mind that being non constructive in a suggestion thread is not the answer either 
bumping until someone provides a substantial argument against it
i think this topic segueways into another concern of mine if devs who didnt already have accounts were expected to maintain an account in eve online as mentioned in the op i dont think they should have any access to special benefits such as fastracked character creation boosting skillpoints etc or extra isk because i think that one of the harshest and most broken parts of the game is the initial beginning of your career in eveif devs cannot play the game on their own credit card from the beginning of their career with a character that does not need to buy isk which can play enjoyably without additional accounts and can eventually take part in 00 battles then they should look at the game in its entirety instead of relying on the csm to point out problems from which they can cherry pick the parts that sound like they should be fixedccp staff should be personally affected by problems in game if they cant play the game and enjoy it all the way from character creation to alliance warfare they should take those issues personallythere is a clear design of pushing multiple accounts character buying and timecarding behaviour tied to a vast isk sink broken sov warfare in the game which would make a real life casino blush at least when you go there there are signs on the walls which warn you about gambling addictionwould you go to a casino where the tables are obviously rigged the elevators dont work and you cant sell your chips back to the house
wow i agree with mazzilliu on something but yea i agree there was a post somewhere on these boards recently that polled the devs on how much they played and what aspects they played the ones that came forward primarily said they were carebears that lived and played in high sec maybe one in the whole thread said they played in low sec as a pirate and i cannot recall any admitting to living in 00 that saddened me because that is the area i feel the devs need to experience first hand to understand how the lag and issues affect the players
totally supported you shouldnt have to accidentally kill your mates carrier just to find out how much damage your fighter bombers do right 
sure just make sure you can check a box to turn it off on ships that are not drone based and you dont really care about them either put the setting in the log settings or in the drone settings
you can steal poss in highsec now heres how 1 find a sweet pos do intel to see if you can handle the owners if things get lively 2 dec the corp 3 add all known members into address book 4 when any of them are online watch the pos closely and cloaked even before the war goes live some corps try to take their poss down before a war rather than risk a forced removal5 if they start taking it down have a cloaky transport get in position to scoop it also have other allies on hand to bump away their scoopingships if they do it this way you can get the tower highsec pos owners are suprisingly likely to do this because most are unaware of how vunerable they are to theft while unanchoring a pos under the false belief they are safe till the war dec goes live6 be prepared to remove the pos by force if they are smart enough to keep it up and online if they do you get the other stuff after blowing the tower up if they force you to do it this way you get the stuff the tower leaves behind for dead poss of dead corps just dec the corp and dronelazer them to death cheapest way if you want the spot itd be nice to take the tower of course so i offer tenative support for this but dont overlook fun ways you can already relieve someone of their pos toys in empire
ill be honest having dozens of offlined towers all over eve is annoying at times however i dont think stealing them is the answer i think towers that are not kept online should start to receive damaged at an exponential rate till they are destroyed more exact something that would emulate the degradation of a structure in space without the proper defense to keep it structurally intact it would give people a chance to recover or repair and online a tower that was mistakenly left without fuel and the such it would as far as i understand also help with decreasing trash left over the years by playerscorps no longer active maybe even adding a positive effect to the servers performance
no need to allow stealing them abandoned control towers should just be garbage collected ie destroyed just like abandonded secure containers after 30 days
if its solely the tower no labs guns hardners ecm or anything i would support thispersonally i think it would be far better to have a cool down timer i mean we love timers in eve right that runs for say 7 daysa 7 day timer allows players with busy lives to plonk their tower down then return and fuel it etcif after this time the tower has still not been activated it would become unanchorable by anyone with the required anchoring skillsthis has the added bonus that it gives a time when the tower will become a free for all this gives us all new places to fight win  winso supported in some implementation
hint  if you dont keep enough fuel in your pos you deserve to lose it
indeed i support this
i like this

i support your lock of this thread and hope you will bring it up in the next csm meeting so they can weigh in on whether or not it gets to be requested as actually getting locked at some point in the next 2 years but probably not until at least 18 months have passed
bump to the topthis thread should be given a sticky  astonishing fit terrible story and his name is avorill now there is only one domi in the whole game  lets hope this petition is solved and ccp will take if from chribba and give it to this champ right here
dear ccpfix thread locking this has gone on too long the attempted locking of threads and the ensuing lulz
yea and ccp said unto avorill your thread shall be lockedand yet it wasntboo for ccps refusal to reimburse glitched ships
had to get in on this
navigators lock button has been caught in the ever more common spacial distortions that are plaguing eve oh noes
this is a proposal to try and improve salvaging as a profession with this change wrecks would automatically become abandoned and easily scannable after they are two hours old and they last another two hours or so optional in return salvaging wrecks while they are still yellow would give aggression rightsthis meansninja salvagers can still have their fun in the first two hourssalvaging as a carebear profession is made more viableoptional mrs who like salvaging wrecks have a chance to keep them
yes if the person doesnt come back after two hour they auto abandon and abandoned wreaks are able to be probed out one of the best compromises ive seen for salvage professionals id even go so far as to say they autoabandon after an hour and only last one more hour this is so there is no additional utilization on the server to keep the wreaks active for another two hours
these threads keep happening so im just going to link to my other responses
not supported
im sorry i dont understand your reasoning why
dont read so goodim not supporting because of the clause i quoted your compromise still insinuates that the salvage belongs to the mission runner or whomever killed the wrecksalvage does not belong to anyone until it is in your hold ccp has been very clear on thatthus no compromise needs to be madesure make wrecks auto abandon after anytime period for all i care but the right to salvage any wreck is first come first serve and i do not see any legitimate reason to change that
hmm thats a fair point my intention was given the nature of a salvaging profession to make it easier for salvagers to find wrecks that have actually been abandoned rather than ones a mission runner is going to come back to later but thats not really necessary the idea should still work without that clausethanks for the feedback 
not supportedautomatically abandoning wrecks and making them easily scannable kills salvaging as a profession as anyone and their dog can go salvaging it is bad enough the entry level to salvage is as easy as it is now your change worsens the situationaggression rights from salvaging is a bad idea ccp has stated salvage isnt owned until you extract it from a wreck id rather make it harder or less ideal to locate an active mission runner for salvagers to interlope your whole idea goes against this rather id have the following1 wrecks can only be scanned down outside of deadspace areas inside they are not wrecks from a deadspace areaturned in mission get their countdown timer reset so upon completion of the mission they persist for another 12hours whatever is more prudent with resource management you can still scan down a mission runners ship and drones but the wrecks are protected from being probed out regardless of your probescanning skills2 wrecks outside of deadspace areas can be scanned down with a deep space scanner probe ie astrometrics v required to find wrecks in spacethere could even be a special probe to locate wrecks that requires astrometrics vthis makes salvaging a real profession by forcing salvagers to have real skills3 ideally id like an additional skill rank 45 to validate a salvagers profession in narrowing down wrecks but i dont see it happening wo a special probe for this as mentioned above which id supportagain to make salvaging a real profession scanning down space salvage should be a more specialized profession and the rewards should have more hurdles to overcome not less when we make more wrecks available to the public via scanning them down making it harder for everyone and anyone to scan out the wrecks as i suggest actually distinguishes the professional salvager from the opportunist who happens to stumble upon someone which they can still do as so called ninja salvagers do nowunderstand that once completed missions are turned in more salvage and loot will be readily available to anyone who trained to find it so more modulesreprocessed minerals and salvage on the market i think that should come with a cost of an extra skill or two to use a specialized probe in order to access this new bounty in space
i think the barrier to entry for professional salvaging is more related to the probing mechanic than any particular ingame skill as you say its easy for everyone to go salvaging already if the situation is so bad why dont people go for it nowthat said i think your idea is pretty neat it would certainly add more depth to salvaging i think the proposal achieves many of the same goals with much simpler changes to the game though

oh ffs stop playing with words you numpties
hwt huge wall of text just to say i can neither confirm nor deny that eve is a pvp related game with a sandbox environment or that its a sandbox environment with pvp concord isnt here to save you concord is here to avenge you
youre right to some extend but youre also so very wrongas you know youre already on my  list and i am out to get you but im replying just to prevent others who might read this to fall in the same perceptual trap you havefirst and foremost its a video game which has certain game rulesthe gamemechanics allow players notice players as in players of video games not rl people to destroy game assets of other players anywhere in the game worldthe gamemechanics also allow to some extend roleplaying but here is the crux if youre going to get emotional about peoples behaviour in eve it is in fact you who are crossing the line between rl and a stupid spaceshipgame not the so called griefersi could be very nasty and ask you why you want this game cosmos to be so morally just but that would be cruel indeed
from the csm 5 summing meeting minutes a presentation and discussion about the eve economy was postponed when this session dragged into the evening and it was decided to adjourn for the dayfrom the following sections of the minutes the presentation and discussion on the eve economy was never done during the meetingi think that ccp should send to the csm for review at least the presentation that was prepared for that meeting there are several questions about the tools and the informations ccp use to evaluate the situation of eve economy with some serious doubt about an inadequate information gathering systemi at least would like to see some information on what ccp know and how they gather and elaborate the data
supported correctly balancing the eve economy is of the utmost importance
dont agree at this point i think csm may need to turn into a oneissue broken record on the issue of game development priorities and all the well just push out the framework of the feature and then finish it later features in the game if ccp continues to stonewall on this problem until after dust and incarna there may not be an economy to balance
thats a depressingly good point
mynxee i agree wholeheartedly that mass resignation would be exactly the wrong thing to do the csm is doing as much as can be hoped for a group of volunteers with limited time limited access and nearzero formal power you guys rock in my opinionthat said im impressed that youre still willing to say theres been some progress you have been professional but frank about your disappointments after your visit to iceland but any progress you saw there would seem to me to have been if not negated then at least seriously diminished by the baghdad bob performance by ccp in the recent threadnaught some of you reading this may be too young to remember the iraqi minister of defense standing in a press conference as american tanks closed in on bagdad american tanks what american tanks there are no american tanks that was baghdad bobanyway myxnee i respect your view that there was some progress in iceland even though the csm minutes dont really show it in my view but if that was two steps forward zulus blog detailing exactly how many devs are not available to work on any legacy game features was six or eight steps backwards and the complete failure of ccp to respond in any meaningful way to the player outrage over that revelation in the subsequent week or so has left me feeling that no there has not been and will not be any progress on the development priority  player priority issuesbut i continue to value your opinion is there a puzzle piece im missing or am i just looking at the same pieces with a more pessimistic and juandiced eye
thatccp never said that they were abandoning working on legacy content for 18 months that is what the players heardtoo tired to go looking for the info but somewhere in the dev blog or summit minutes ccp stated that 20 of the development time is spent on correcting legacy issues now some of those issues are going to be in the background cleaning up code and such we as players may not see tangible changes there that does not meant that they did not happenpi hahahahah sorry still has a development team they intend to tweak and improve it the larger issue is that the players want what they want and they want it now that can not always happen fix lag well hey are working on it if you want it fixed then get on the test server and help with the mass testing fix low sec well i have come to realize that i am in the end anti low sec there is no fix for low sec ever it is broken by design lowsec is not for the solosmall corp to pvp in npc 00 fits that bill no changes to low sec will fix the main problem which is that there are 10 wolves for every sheep the sheep dont last long so your stuck with wolves get rid of the wolves nurf pirates to oblivian and you get sheep otherwise any changes will have no discernible effectfix faction warfare gotta say this is reasonable people do forget they have made changes not all popular to fw since it was introduced at a basic level they need get rid of the play after dt bonus that affects fw as well as every other mechanic that using random spawningfix the font huge issue here is where ccp does things wrong people have been begging for a new font for ages they have had someone in house working on the font for over a year they just announced this at the summit what why not say this is a problem we are in the process of getting it fixed current eta is unknown now the truth is there is a good reason for ccp to keep quiet tell a kid your going to go get some ice cream and they  scream and yell when am i going to get icecream drop the ice cream in their lap and they are surprised and happy if ccp says something is coming then the players log in the next day and expect to see it there and complain if it is not that is a player problem that forces ccp to keep quiet instead of being more opentbh there are a lot of other things to mention and one of these days i will spend the time writing up the big post on this topic but npc 00 is calling got stuff to get done before i head to work
well unless the csm minutes are inaccurate ccp did say they werent working on low sec or fw within that time frame which are the two biggest legacycontent elephants and i dont consider the bugfixing 20 to be pertinent to the discussion were talking specifically about all of the neglected features stuff that needs gamedesign attention to fix stuff thats been on the table for years these are not bugs these are features that need iteratingi also think its disingenuous for anybody to point at the team working on pi as proof that ccp is working on legacy content we were promised before pi ever came out that it would have a team dedicated to iterating it that team was supposed to be built in to the feature which leaves exactly nobody working on the longneglected legacy content and csm minutes reflecting that nobody will be working on it for at least 18 months with no commitments after that date either i love this game i want there to be progress but i cant see any in the public stuff right now
i also think the csm is doing well
no im not saying you should be banned for doing either one what im saying is that the alliance that gets disbanded should be able to have some sort of period where they can counter the disbanding im not sure how it would work but i dont think it makes sense that a single person can click a button and an entire alliance is gone forevermy latter comment refers to the players that do stuff in game for out of game reasons ie im going to disband an alliance in eve because i really like ing people off weve seen it plenty of times where an alliance infiltrates another alliance disbands with a single click and doesnt even occupy that spacenote i have never agreed with the fact that a single person can disband an alliance
what you dont understand is that uk as an institution didnt lose sovereignty only three systems of about twenty four dropped out because the corporations holding them and contributing were kicked from the organization the actual institution of uk itself still had the majority of the sovereignty held systems intact even if the members whod contributed to things were gone from ukthe former members of uk have had ample opportunity to buy back their organization and regain their sovereignty stations and stuff practically overnight but cant seem to swallow their pridesorry about your broserfs
i think this hits the nail on the head in a roundabout sort of way the frequency and content of ccps devblogs and news posts have been seriously lacking as said by most of the devs when going about posting blogs they go through multiple revision cycles and even need approval before posting while i am all for a polished and efficient official statement youd think thats not what a devblog is supposed to be for its supposed to be for explaining what the neat things ccp is working on its all smoke and mirrors unless there is constant dialoguei guess that is what the csm was supposed to be increased dialogue between ccp and the player base unfortunately this still does not resolve the communication issue we often treat the csm representatives more like politicians than what it seems that they really are individuals that we the player base have selected to dive into ccps inner sanctums to hopefully procure more information about what they are doing often times we suggest things just to see what the devs are thinking and pray for a response and when none comes we remain lost and cluelesswhat ever happened to the in development and on the drawing board sections in the last devblog zulu was kind enough to offer an insight into their team structures and the rather vague goals they are working towards what about reviving the drawing board why not offer a running tally on what they are doing a shivers twitter feed even if we might not like what they are doing its better than nothing even the occasional ccp mspaint scribbles are nicethen again maybe we are just spoiled rarely do other game companies offer the consistent updates ccp does all you get from the others are occasional screen shots to bait interest or simple press releases we only clamor for more because we get more we are addicts of a drug named eve

ive flown the sin and the widow ive never once considered using them as anything other than a platform to insert bombers into a fight via black ops cynotheyre terribly expensive very crunchy and have such tiny fuel holds its embarassingif theyre not going to be improved as combat vessels at least step them all up to the widows usefulness by giving them all some sort of ewar boosti can live with black ops being support if they can fill a support role maybe an rr boost or rr and ewar just something more interesting than 600 million isk battleship with as much hp as a t1 bc and about as much dps that can jump and bridge a little bit
i currently own and operate both the redeemer and widow the redeemer is one hell of a ship to use for 00 jump bridge freighter ganking and the jumpinandinstapermajam on the widow can be nice in lowsec however they like all bobs were nerfed prerelease and are excruciatingly underpowered even compared to an eossin needs to be a gun platformdrones are simply not a damage platform suitable for the black ops intended role in fact the kronos is much better suited to a drone boat than the sin and vice versa now i dont fly the sin and i dont plan to because im not rtarded but this is all common senseblack ops need at the very least old mothership jump range 40ly basethere are some gatetogate jumps you cant make their entire purpose can be negated by such a ridiculous situation however bobs were meant to have a very high barrier of entry so having a covert cynosural navigation skill requiring bobs 4 and jdc 5 extend bobs range would also be sufficient not only all of what i mentioned about this but i had jdc 5 before even injecting or at that time no inject option so training for 2 seconds any skill for jumpcapable ships so i know what max range is like and how insufficient it ismassive bridge fuel reduction nowto bridge a bobs can take 60x the fuel it would have taken to jump it do you know what ones fuel bay at the time cargo bay feels like after having to bridge all your fellow bobs because only you have jdc5 not only that but the fuel use per ly is completely out of whack being 27x the fuel used if a titan bridged the same ship the same distancefuel bay inproportionate to fuel consumptionbecause of the bridging fuel use see above one may have to refuel two or three times just to bridge a bomber fleet through a single jump however if bridge fuel use was lowered set to 125 of current should suffice this issue would no longer be problematicinadequate cloakyes yes we all know how cloaking is now but this ship really needs the covert cloak unlike the stealth bomber which only helped somewhat the blackops actually needs the covert cloak it has little to no real combat capabilities comapared to any pvp ship in eve and jump mechanics make them their only practical target save for unescorted haulers who have to be idiots to be doing that to begin with and as such a covert cloak would be far from opship maintenance bayim not asking for some huge bay just enough to store two frigates or a single cruiser in addition the maintenance bay would behave like the rorquals in that the bobs bay would only be able to store ships capable of using its portal some may consider this op and ill admit it may be a bit excessive in addition to the covert cloak but this change in addition to standard t2 bonuses would give it a support role which would not necessitate the covert cloak sort of like the 2008 mothership obviously i am not pushing for a corporate hangar that would be overly excessive even in a wet dreamtldr the black ops really needsincreased range 40ly base 90ly  jdc5 should sufficebridge fuel coefficient changed to at least a humane levelfuel bay proportional to bridge fuel use fuel bay should hold enough isos to bridge bobs and 25 manticores 45ly  bridge 4 jfc 5very small jh2only ship maintenance baymy 2UFFFDedit  forgot to support lol

supported galente really do need a boost in pvp and i rally would like to see them get a blaster dmg increase as i do believe they should be in ya face ships all so why cant they shoot all damage types since its the same as a projectile weapons just with out the gun powder
ive taken a long and in depth look at the problem of blasters1 tracking the biggest problem blasters have is that they have the worst relative tracking out of all the guns out there at the same time guns by and large and especially long range weapons actually have way too much tracking as a solution nerf the tracking of all weapon systems other than blasters this will seriously screw up mission runners however whose missions usually involve long range weapons and many small targets then again the most successful mission boats never used hybrids as their primary armament2 blaster platforms a lightning bruiser platform that is depending on controlling distance more than any other ship requires speed and agility as well as substantial ehp to make up for the complete lack of range inherent to the combination of blasters and drones which are the gallentean doctrine it is too easy to defeat blaster platforms of the same class by simply staying outside their range heavy armor plating is a must for a blaster platform just to survive the time it takes to get into blaster range when attacking a ship of a bigger slower class heavy armor plating however massively reduces effective speed and agility solution increase both speed and agility of blaster platformsthe only alternative is to fundamentally change the gallente without a huge agility and speed blasters dont work which means theyd be better off being shield tankersrangespeedpowertoughnesspick three

all the points that messenger001 has listed in the original post have been constantly repeated by a lot of other players time after time must be a reason for this and its not the bull repliesposts that you all made against messenger001 you all think you have a direct line to ccp devs and can speak for them when all you really are is just a bunch of no balls internet bullys hiding behind a computer all i see in this forum is a bunch of loser griefer trolls who can only get their jollies by talking smack and pretending to be something that theyre notyou all say low security needs more action with more players when in fact its little kids like most of you that have made low security almost non existent with the 247 endless gate camps and now youre all trying to justify grief exploits such as the suicide gank squads in high security as being piracy since you think youre all badass pvp players then go to 00 and try your little grief tactics there youll get your little butts spanked quicker than you can write a flame troll about meright now you all think you have the upperhand and ccps blessing while trying to hide behind grief exploits just remember that it only takes a few harassment petitions to be sent in to get your characters bannedill gladly go 1v1 against any of you so call pvp experts if you got the balls to do it without having to cry for help from other so called pvp expertsthere will be a reckoning time in eve an apocalypse a new era a vendetta list will be made character names will be entered and slaughtered corporations will be hunted down to extinction and alliances will be broken forever youll know its happening when you see fleets of bounty hunting pve players come crashing through the gates and snuff out your little worlds of exploitationtrolling removed  adida

as long as it is balanced i feel it can be fun im not disagreeing but remember the bounty hunter is not hunting npcs here he or she is hunter other real players bounty hunting regardless of the fact they are hunting criminals or nefarious players should not be a free license for easy and quick killsit is for this reason i can never imagine a bounty hunting system where i can log into eve pick up a bounty mission from an agent and expect to complete it in the course of an evening thats just not how eve worksi imagine a bounty hunter mission system where the completion rate is actually rather low id hazard a guess at less than 50 of all bh missions accepted be actually completed remember this is pvp we are talking about not npc hunting i imagine very many bounty hunters would find themselves over their heads huting other playersit is for these reasons i see only truly dedicated players going far down the path of the bounty hunter profession i dont think it would work any other way
heres the point im trying to make that i think you are missing i expect that even when the bounty hunter reaches the target after taking the time to jump 10 or 15 jumps and reorienting to go another 5 or 10 jumps and finally catching up its still as good a bet as not that the bounty hunter will fail because he cannot kill the target  and that likely means he will lose his shipi think youre neglecting the fact that people who have bounties are generally capable of taking care of themselves and quite often dont travel alone that is if theyre traveling at all finding the target is not guarantee of collecting the bountyin short i expect that even with the hand holding of picking a target that is on at the appropriate time and nearby within the region that the failure rate will still be very high one further note is that i expect the number of bounties to be higher than it is now if the system is changed to something that works its not like every bounty hunter is going to get the same targetin my view the point is not to make bounty hunters successful its to try as hard as possible to ensure there is the possibility of an engagement its what people who have bounties want its what people who are looking to collect bounties want lets give it to themi do not have a vendetta against people who are likely to end up with bounties i think this would increase pvp with no bias toward either side of the conflictcommitment to fighting another player is commitment enough dont make them jump half way across new eden and pull an alarm clock op to do it
fyi your reality is composed of a paradise where other players funnel into your blob to be farmed while your alt operates in high sec with impunity when things arent going your way i suggest u wake up sometime lest u start thinking reality should cater to your own fluffy fantasies 1 yes it is because if ure over 5 sec and u get attacked thats what happens2 yet your proposal will only affect high sec piracy and does nothing against low sec pirates 3 because with the blob u hide behind no bounty hunter would be able to touch u and even without your blob u can just dock up and log in an alt who u want to be 100 safe all reward no riskhow convenient for ukeep dreaming 1 actually u and your corp just posts all the killseven if its against other corpmates its no problem at all just hilarious 2 refer back to 13 i understand it perfectly what u dont understand is that replacing the system with another broken one isnt the answer no different than boosting low sec with better asteroids better lp when it doesnt change the risks at all which is certain death then again u already had this in mind when u created this proposal ill bet 4 ure not supposed to lose anything in a blob unless u got outblobbednews flashaint gonna happen so keep on dreaming in your own little reality why because like i said before it just boils down to another attempted suicide gank nerf with a weak low sec boost that will only backfire when none of the bounty hunters can even touch one pirate because theyll always be afkdockedblobbingmacrominingalt if anyone cant cope with their own personal concerns its u for not being able to understand the concept of risk vs reward trolling removed zymurgist
third time luckyi really do wish you would quit it with the your doing this because you failsuits you etc its boring and to anyone actually reading the idea properly obviously untruei really do not see how this is a direct suicide ganking nerf it does not stop it occurring does it it does add a potential penalty i can see that but the existing system provides the same mechanism albeit without real teeth in most casesi say again not every pirate in the game blobs yeah some do some do in large gangs some do in small the idea is not for this to be an easy mission to accomplish but to address 2 major points1 most kill rights go to waste2 most bountys go back to the target of the bounty that just isnt right at all  can you at least agree with this or will no longer being able to collect your own bounty hit your bottom line too muchrisk vs rewardwell the rewards could be very high if someone really wants someone dead and yeah i would expect there to be high risk with it your simply stating your desire to keep the status quo with suicide ganking its quite understandable if that is your primary means of having funrest assured this is not done out of a desire to nerf it i enjoy it as much as the next man the idea is to fix the busted bounty system that is what the topic is so kindly stick to it nice to see you can finally write a civilized all be it misguided response rest assured if you go back to your previous antics i will keep reporting it and getting it removed
confirming that u have nothing to back up your false claims so now ure doing everything u can to try and silence the opposition because u cant even refute most of my posts removing insurance isnt a direct suicide ganking nerf either and it wouldnt stop it yet ppl suggest that as well simply because they cannot push for a direct one without the opposition crushing them what u fail to see is that the only difference your proposal has is nothing more than an incentive no different than trying to boost low sec and failing at it the only impact this would remotely have is in high sec where pirates can exploit alts to hide behind to help themselves out of being hunted and u obviously want to make it safer for their alts theres still the matter of afkdocking and hiding behind alts which u still have yet to address1 many things go to waste in eve such as the 00 resources that the major alliances hold over their many systems hell even the low sec resources that pirates could use but instead simply patrol to in search of prey does that mean u should force ppl to use or lose them just because its wasteful no2 heres the thingsuppose that your proposal does go through somehow and u get an extremely high bounty on a notorious low sec pirate turns out hes also friendly to some major 00 alliances guess how many players in that alliance can take up these bounty missions and one of them will inevitably be able to collect on it and split it with the target thx for your isk refer back to 2 1 and what u dont realize is that your proposal does nothing but offer an incentive which can still be exploited with allies and end up backfiring on u2 your intentions r irrelevantwhat is relevant r the consequences and how ppl will react and adapt to itwas it misguided because the truth hurts or was it misguided because u cant refute it its clearly both and as such ill bet ull try to report this one as well because now its becoming clear what your true intentions r in continuing to try and push this through more easy ganks and a safer high sec to hide behindnot gonna happen so whats your next last reply gonna be
i suppose this may be where our ideas for bounty hunting diverge i dont really see bounty hunting as a system for players to sign up for quick on the fly pvp i feel that faction warfare should be more suited to that role and i envision a low sec revamp expansion to include enhancements to both faction war and bounty hunting i also think it should be called nemesis but thats another matter hehi feel that the bounty hunter profession should be tailored more towards the patient hunter style player the type of player that will cruise through low sec stalking a potential victim taking note of their play habits and setting a trap before finally engaging his prey to that type of player that one successful trap that may have taken a week of planning and waiting and observations is much more savory than 10 quick n dirty engagements
thats precisely how i want to see it
while i applaud the vision i think thats a set up for disappointment first imagine that youve got a predictable target that spends 4 hours a day in game but it happens to be the exact opposite of your schedule so he starts playing at 1 am your time and quits about 5 am for the sake of the argument you work a normal 8 to 5 job to figure out his play hours youve got to first log on during the middle of the night assuming you get lucky and hes on when you are youve got to figure out rough bounds for the timeframe he plays and then you have to move to where he is log in when hes on and hope that he undocks and youd better hope that he undocks where he cant immediately redock and in something that cant kill you or simply warp away  people with a low security status who you are likely to find a bounty on fly in lowsecurity space and are expecting to be attacked when they undockimagine for a minute that i am the target i have a job a wife and a 3yearold ill probably log in 5 out of 7 days in the week and one or two of those times i might not even leave the station when i decide im bored with a particular region i clone jump to another or worse for you pack up my junk and move this happens quite oftenso you manage to track me down but you have absolutely no idea when im going to log in next and when you finally manage to find me in both space and temporal locales i decide im going to clone jump and you have to start all over againnow i dont imagine that my play style is the majority but i do imagine there are quite a few others out there like meimagine again that youre even unluckier and manage to score a contract on kane rizzel well he just unusbscribed  so youre going to be waiting a long time you spend a week looking for him before you realize he just isnt logging in anymore and before you say that you can just filter out people who arent paying often times people will go on vacation and may only log in once a week to check skills or other boring tasksnot to mention that if youre spending a week on a kill it had better be worth it i wouldnt spend that long on a task which required me to move halfway around new eden and alarm clock to take out a target for less than 500 million isk that kind of a reward is ripe for the same kind of exploitation thats popular with the current bounty system albeit much less likely the only way to truly rule out exploitation like that is to make the bounty worth no more than the hull valuemight i suggest that if this is the intent it should be phrased as killrights trading via some sort of assassination contract rather than a replacement for the bounty system why bother to get agents involved with it at all just have some sort of support for people advertising that they are for hire choose one that you trust based on his record and create an assassination contract requiring killrights lots of isk and a willing assassin if the contract fails the original victim gets the killrights back to try againi think theres room for both ideas ill stop polluting your thread with my ideas which seem to be about a fundamentally different system

lowsec borders good differnet currencies would just make a mess
anything to keep the amarr out of heimatar also it could cause some very interesting changes to lowsec in general

it would be nice to be able to hotkey more commandsview market data would be wonderful as a hotkeyalso group the numbers on the calculator with commas 1234567 is much easier to read in that tiny eve font then1234567
why didnt you add more watch list options like maual sorting and folders do you think that would result in other balance issues or just skipped it
mostly judgement call about how easy i thought implementation would be there are several items in the lowhanging fruit that are probably halfway up the tree in any casei know its a bit arbitrary but with over 80 items to choose from i had to draw the line somewhere if the process works and gets some ccp love then we can always do low hanging fruit ii
ah okay no problem just curious anywayedit this part was supposed to be deleted was from the edit of my previous post when internet was gone so i made new one instead but the previous part was still in itfurb killer781415374546535461852959 btwand i like to make the comment that some changes would be a bad idea mainly those adding more stuff to the contextual menu yes many of them would be really handy although sub menus to add extra confirmation layer before thrashing stuff ist needed imo just make sure you dont press it all the time accidently but soon the contextual menu becomes so extended it gets sentient solution for that is imo hiding and removing stuff that cannot be used instead of graying out stuff that isnt used often and by clicking at the bottom of the contextual menu on a downward arrow or something you can get everything otherwise it just becomes too bloated

meh getting old 
small poss are cheap and getting cheaper why do we need a minipos that doesnt need fuel so the same people who would put up the small pos would instead anchor several miniposs and make it harder for people to get a pos up in low sec as the people who have poss out there now would be taking up more space by anchoring to more objects currently if you share the password it lets anyone who uses it in this idea is just riddled with redundancy to current features
cause its what people want and its not space second life
heavy support this is excellent for pirates who are highly mobile with faction war needing a fix this is excellent for guys who are just getting into pvp it needs to be capturable you play all those other space games with mini pirate complexes for resupplying this is exactly what im thinking ofand we can anchor acceleration gates to limit the types of ships that can come in like the pirate who colonize the dead space complexes quiet good for small plex war actuall profit involved
as with anything in lowsec its risky but thats no reason not to impliment hell a pos of any kind in the wrong region of lowsec can mean billions of isk down the drain in less than a few daysthis is a good idea if for no other reason than it would encourage more smallscale activity in lowsec
last night i was in a 4 man fleet of bs one running a eccm t2 and the other 3 running duel eccm t2s now the problem we had was one scorpion perma jammed 3 of the 4 ships and the 3 ships where the duel eccms witch is 75 points each im still a little fuzzy on ecm but that just dose not seem right a little over powered my thoughtsso its ether boost eccm more or nurf ecmps also they should get a stacking penaltyhugs and kisses fraggle
yes i totally agree ecm is way to over powered it always seems to roll in favour of the jammer and not the person being jammed dont get rid of it just make it a little more even
from what i understand ecm is chance basedin order to have a good chance of getting a jam off an ecm ship must have their modules sensor strength exceed the sensor strength of the receiving ship if the receiving ships sensor strength is higher then the odds of resisting a jam are stacked in its favor but it by no means eliminates the chance that might be jammedsounds to me that you either got a few bad dice rolls or the scorpion was loaded with ecm buffing modules to overcome eccmnot supported
ecm is horse 1x rifter  1 x ecm ship can beat anything that isnt a titanmothership its garbage make eccm make you immune to it or something with a drawbackso many times ive lost a ship whilst just being slowly killed off without being able to target anything i dont usualy care about losing a ship trust me ive lost loads but whenever im perma jammed to death it makes me wonder why i bother
you got 2 thumbs up from me ecm seams like another over powered thing to come out of a cal ship p  all ewar gets stacking penalty why not ecm i would love to see ecm nurfed or revamped
fix this s item its got to much juice i could see one or 2 ships around there own class but ive seen a balckbird jam up 2 bs and a bc so i think its way op give us more sen strength and better eccm or just nurf ecm like you did sen damping
ecm isnt the problem its the specialized ships15 or 30 per level is just too much no other ship gets those numbers on anythingthats 150 bonus on a falcon with lv5s and also ecm has modules and rigs wich improve performanceother ewar dosentthe ships need to be toned down a bit imho
i think you hit the nail on the head with that one drop there ridicules bonus on the ecm ships and give the ecm itmes a stacking penalty like all other ewar itmes all so why are cal the othe race that get a ewar bs  kind regards
what he said
edit forgot to supportcurse 5 bonus to td per levelarazu 5 sensor damp bonus per levelrapier 75 target painter bonus per levelfalcon 30 ecm strength bonus per levelwhich ships bonus isnt like the restthat said ecm without a bonus is complete fail the base modules could use a boost in conjunction with a steep ecm boat nerf also the signal distortion amp should boost all tier 1 ew not just ecm so it should boost tds sensor damps and painters as well sensor strength also needs to be reworked or ecm mods sized the reason is a falcon has a 120 chance of jamming a rifter with 1 racial jammer theoretically 1 falcon could dive into the middle of an 7 man frigate gang and be completely impervious to attack because of that
opposedyoure whining about a ship with no tank and possible limited weapons ability put your drones on it and watch them melt otherwise quit swinging the banhammer at stuff you dont necessarily like 
it is almost a statistical impossibility you were perma jammed long with those ships so i assume you are being creative with the truth also nerfing ecm ships isnt the solution they are in principle reasonably balanced nowhowever the entire ecm mechanics need an overhaul imo they just arent fun they pretty much completely incapacitate your ship during a fight when they work it should obviously hurt the target ship but not as strong as it does now to compensate they should then have higher chance to succeed
the only time drones are a viable defense is when the ewar pilot messes up his warp all ecm boats can and almost always do operate well outside drone control rangeecm is so broken on the small scale shipsgangs that it isnt even funny a brokenness that is further amplified by the relatively minor effect of eccm except in extremes where you fit on recons or 23 at a timewe need eccm rigs ecm jam mechanic needs to change eccm needs a general boost and ecxxx drones need to be removedchanged
i would post a reasoned critique but instead im just gonna say f ecm and leave it at that
this andalso no stacking penalty on eccmand split the unscannability mechanic to use just the base sensor strength
not supportedsorry man you got unlucky on the rolls its hard enough to jam a non eccmed ship without stacking multiple jammers eccmed ships can get jammed but the jam chance is so low that it basically means the jamming ship is doing almost nothingsince its chance based you may get unlucky from time to time and since the jam is a on or off effect theres really no way to mitigate this one way would be only reducing the max number of targets lockable but in pvp you need only one target active really except perhaps logistics and ewar ships the jam chance is already low enough even on skilled ships its not as high as it may seem from that huge 30 bonus per leveledit also they already have stacking penalties if you have 25 chance to jam with one jammer adding a second jammer wont raise your jamming chance to 50 you will just have another shot at the 25 chance which means your final chance after 2 jammers is about 4375 which is 25 of 100 plus 25 of 75
that is not a stacking penalty obvoisly two 50 jammers will not give you a 100 jamm as two 60 webbers will not make a ship go backwards with 20 of its speed i wouldm have loled instead every next works with the left over jamming chanse so two 50 webbers will reduce speed to 75 a bit more because of penalty but lets us ignore that for nowfirst reduces it to 50 the second one reduces whats left 50 by half thats how you get 25 same thing with jammers this is not stacking penalty stacking penalty would be when 4th and onwards jammers would be next to useless and have no effect stacking more then four webbers does next to nothing same should hapopen with jammersif i sacrafice two slots to protect myself from one out of four types of ewar it should be a significant amount of protection but instead a falcon can still jamm 12 eccmed battleships quite well that shall not be
people who hate ecm and think eccm is underpowered cant do math worth squata scorpion takes months of training to properly use and requires a huge amount of pilot skill because its ehp is extremely low for a battleship good at ecm bad at virtually everything else balanced
your comparison falls pretty short  because the only 1 of those ships has to dedicate almost all of its slots and especially all of its primary tanking slots to its chance based ewarand guess what it is not the curse arazu or rapier and you also kindly ignore that all the other ships got 2 types of bonuses ewar and for that it is 20 warp scramblerdisruptor range bonus for the arazu 60 bonus to web range and for the curse you have 40 bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer range and 20 bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer transfer amount per leveli am not sure the 30 bonus of the falcon are that much out of line but i guess using a proper comparison would have made your argument a noop to begin with
you think thats bad i was in a 6 man rr bs gang all of us had dual eccms one yes one guy in a scorp managed to perma jam all of us and wiped out the enite fleet i think theres a bug with ecms that hes exploitingthe guys name was cn0rr1s
a solo scorpion managed to kill 6 bs on its ownand people say caldari ships suck for pvp
thanks i know math and it is a kind of stacking penalty as in you get reduced returns from using multiple instances of the same effect yes its less severe than the usual stacking penalties formula used in eve since well its not a formula at all its just the way independent probability worksits also the only and i want to stress this the only module which works based on pure chance yes you might get better chance though you have to devote multiple slots for it but even with 99 chance theres nothing that says your enemy will not just be lucky and avoid being jammed for all the time it takes to kill you otoh the jammer may get lucky and jam you even with double eccmsmost ewar ships have almost no tank often poor range and even in those cases where the range is good a dampener works wonders against ecm users and dampener is not chance based and can be used quite effectively even on unbonused shipsso id say that ecm is good as it is perhaps the ecm platforms scorpion mostly should be buffed a little since they are paper thin again scorpion in particular i get way more tank with a cookie cutter drake or hell even less tanked bcs
see your talking about the only ewar bs in the game ecm ships are not meant to be close range they are and ecm sips are indeed op i fit ecm to a meg and i would maybe jam one ship but thats it change the flipping ships
1 because most of what youre saying is already implemented if you actually took the time to look anything up youd know that resources in beltssystems is wholly dependant on what area of the universe youre in that is 100 true also for 00 belts spawn different resources in different regions2 00 markets are far from stagnant it may not be as wild and crazy as jita but i 100 finance all my worthless pvp on playing the market in 00 and i do damn well for by it you stick your neck out you reap the rewards3 your idea would have no impact on 00 warfare or holdings as they currently are the 00 powerblocs are all well entrentched and more than happy to keep their systems and just simply throw smaller gangs at each other for funzies changing how beltsmoons work wont do a damn thing to mineral trade everyone will just simply do what theyve always done by going to jita buying it then hauling it4 markets actually do fluctuate during current conflictsif you took the time to actually look at any market data youd see that example war down in providence ealier this year i made a lucrative killing off of modules common in pvp i bought them in jita hauled them put them back up at a markup bam made billions economics 101arguement in short you have thought none of this throughat all your purposal has little to no value does nothing to actually redistibuted resources or conquerable territory and is beyond friggin pointlessmad
lol i dont mean when huge wars happen combat mods increase in demand when i say the geopolitical situation should affect market prices are you trying to be densewhy shouldnt players have an impetus to invade beyond we are bored lol the more you give the better and my point is to build almost anything you want you could just use the local resources in your region alliances cant project their power to get monopolies and fuel a dynamic nullsec it used to be possible not to the extent i am suggesting thought but not really any more
if you acctualy took the time to get into the new 00 mechanics you would understand that you can now find hidden ore sites anywhere with every kind of ore not to mention wormhole space anyone can access and you can even have at increased chance with system upgrades edit with the exception of npc space but wormhole argument is stil valid that however also aquires a lot of effort on your side exspecial in regions were you can only bring stuff into any station when you have docking rights you need to get a charackter in place beforehand  constant hauling sure you can fluctuate a bit but certain alliances have regulations to your market if they catch you you are out and can try to bring the next charackter minus resale of course  i contradict that statement exspecial the changing moons part the change of moonminerals and their wealth was always an issue for combat and would ever be as example would i bring the technethium spike followed by the atlas invasion of geminate sure people will try to make their pretty coin in jita but if it got really low supply it would be handled by corp firstwhich than means trying to get your shiney new thing before anyone else however you were right to say that it dont matters after a certain time because the inflation will just go up as with any other productindeed yet what was a suggested was an addition of valueable market goods to make it lucrative to invade and if the invasion had a drop in supply lets say you had to keep the moon 7 days before it would start harvesting again than i could surely see means to keep the supply low and prices up than again only theory craftingwhile i admit the topic is up for advancement anything that makes people want to conquer space as in this case new materials seems not at all pointless to me if it would redistribute older ressources as you seem to imply with your last statement it would change far too much and had to be thought about for month to ballance it out so i can understand not going into detail there as any number giving would just be jumped on by forumtrolls
bump to make nullsec strictly better and more interesting
because it ended up making strong afs stronger and did nothing for the bad afsalso while i support the idea of pimping up a little destroyers i dont agree with the changes proposed the cormorant isn a fair comparison tbhthrasher artypartygyrostabilizer iimicro auxiliary power core icatalyzed coldgas i arcjet thrusterssensor booster ii scan resolutiontracking computer ii tracking speed280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor sempty high slot280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii tremor ssmall ionic field projector ismall ionic field projector ismall auxiliary thrusters iwith just a little of efting probably there are better fits out there this thing pops most frigates in one volley at 40 km range for assault frigs only a couple more are needed if you use the shorter range ammo you get even higher alphathe caldarigallente destroyers suffer mostly from the fact that hybrids are meh fix them and you probably fix the destroyers as well the amarr destroyer has the advantage of fast ammo switching and iirc higher tracking as wellyes they do this theyre also t1 ships dont ask too much from them
not supporting as this was rased numerous times and was passed to ccp a number of times already but yes desties are underpowered and no they do not excell at killing frigates it took a while for my cormorant even to kill a stealth bomber not good enough
tbh you are also using the worst of the bunch to say that they all need buffing thats like saying that since the diemost deimos is nerfed every hac should be buffed even the zealot like i said cormorant has issues of its own which are aside the issues of the destroyers as a group
ive tried to schedule several events in the new calendar and one problem many of the players have is converting that time to their local time not only that but sometimes eve time will show a different date for most usa players in the evening please show the players local time for each event just add a simple character setting for timezone and then convert it on the client side when viewing the event
step 1 look at the current eve time  datestep 2 look at your clock and local datestep 3 figure out what the difference isstep 4 step 5 profit
most ops for most corps are based on eve time anyway  so no need to change just need people who can do math
while converting eve time to your local time should not be much of a problem i cannot see why this simple change would do any harm it would make life easier for everybody if anythingsure i can do the math but why should i do it myself if i have a computer a machine whose sole purpose is to compute can do it for me
actually it would result in people starting to also use their local tz outside the calendar way easier if everyone just use eve time
i also would like to have local time display inside evei dont mean to replace eve time but additional clock on the side bar so both local time and eve time are displayed and clearly indicated which is whichor it can be done with the tool tips of the eve time clock when you mouse over local time will show in the tool tip bubble
supported devs need to know some of the issues players have first hand
good idea because its simplei dont agree with most of the posts hereyou people are trying to make collecting trash more complicated than taking a 00 systemoffline pos is trash cloging up the serversaving a good moon by anchoring stuff is an exploitbuti like the idea of stealing poses because someone can make isk of someone elses lazynessso just plain and simple after 30 days the pos can be unanchored by anyone with the normal anchor timer and anchoring skillsmaybe after 20 days the owning corp recives mail about their tower permanently being lost within 10 days because maybe just maybe its possible that someone actualy forgets a tower
totally agree we need some mechanism to get rid of offline pos towers wspace is littered with those buggersnot maintaining your assets should cause them to deteriorate and eventually be destroyedstolenid favor the latter at least that way somebody profits from it
i am a pirate fight for the gallente and do combat plexs as my main source of incomewith ccp clearly stating that they wont do much anytime soon i offer a small proposal that i think is easy to implement and can help lowsecmove 610 combat plexs to lowsec only and increase their spawn rate in lowsec to offset the lack of 00 spawns maybe not completely dont want to flood it too muchthis helps in 2 ways 1 increase profitability of lowsec in general and bring more pve centric players hopefully for us pirates to shoot at and as far as i can tell should be a really easy changedo it ccp
everyone knows lowsec missions are a joke that means that the primary pve allure of lowsec is exploration combat sites and plexes simple concept but it is dramaically undermined by the fact that the most valuable plexes being 610s that can appear in lowsec appear more often in my limited experience in 00 the isk making opportunities of lowsec are already a butt of countless jokes but i think this solution would do alot to shift a little bit of the resources away from 00 where there are plenty into anemic lowsec where they are desperately needed
supportedbut the orca pilot should be warned before he helps your little red dotelse more petitions and logs will be handle by ccp  and they dont want that
maybe not allow agressed players to swap ships i cant see why they should be able to do that
yes dynamic  details left to ccp
i propose that we delete and ban all accounts that are older than 2006 they dont enjoy the game anyway
ban all old people
1st  delete characters that were made 7 years ago and never touched again all they did was tie up the cool names like james kirk or george washington2nd  how about a slow sp loss well call it talzheimers
make them start losing skill points after 2 years

oooooo navigator
you have a lot of angry posts in the post by messenger you even offered to 1 v 1 any supposed pvp expertid like to think im pretty good so ill accept your offer anywhere you want just hit me up in gameany chance to get your spewing rage like this cant possibly be passed upoh and crossposting threads like that is against the rules it gets the thread locked so not only do you not understand game mechanics you also dont understand the forum mechanicsawaiting your mail
tldr so other players dont have to read that hellacious thread you would like the game to include an option for a corporation to post a help wanted for other corporations to defend them thats a good enough idea but i think it falls fundamentally into the treaty proposal made in the past and would be at best a component of that systemim behind treaties so in a sense i support your idea you really dont need an in game system for this at the moment though use the forums your local chat and eve gate
i also took it to mean that a corp could ask for help and individual pilots could offer assistance without implicating their corp or alliance for itkinda like hiring mercs only without having all the mercs employed by the same company
this was never actually working in the first place so i think build would be the operative termit will probably not be possible to do until ccp completely rewrites most of the existing pos code im supporting this but people shouldnt get their hopes up
sensor strength is an intended game mechanic its used in the formula for calculating whether you can get a warpable hit on a target as designed by ccp the sensor strength boosting is not an exploit at most youre giving up 45 slots in order to add the eccm as opposed to 1 high slot for a cloak quit whining and learn how to camp or to pvp that is all
i see this  all the time in fw its almost impossible to get a good 2v2 anymore in frigates cause they being gang link boosted by a loki its golf sierra
ccps been very clear on that have theylinkapparently ccps own employees cant agree whether wrecks and salvage should belong to everyone or to the person who did the killing
quoting for truth this is really all this boils down to in the end and watching the reaction of some members of the playerbase quite frankly makes me ing ashamed to be associated with you we love to think of ourselves as more mature and intelligent than other mmo players but unless theres been a sudden outbreak of pantsonhead  syndrome i guess thats just as much of a fallacy as the idea that ccp would deliberately lie to people when they just ing handed them the information 2 days beforeis there more than a hint of spin on ccps responseof course there is its what companies ing do when they get critical press coverage and cant take time for a more detailed response because people are screaming for an answerdoes it justify the level of vitriol which has lead amongst other things to this utterly idiotic proposal ing hell no i guess we should be happy that weve proven once and for all that were really no better than people who play wow after all congratuinglations
nowwhos getting emotional here the threats what fun butwhos confusing real and virtual life in eve lol here is what you should do post with your main and make a warranted claim include in that argument your own presuppositions about eve discuss how these inform your view of eves sandbox and then discuss what that has to do with ethics hint youll want to pay special attention to the consequential nature of eve and then consider whether this makes eve somewhat different from other games eg solitaire versus craps delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
dont sweat it its just sophomoric wordgaming youd see the same crap in almost any 2nd year college english class cosmos blah blah emerging possibilities from the interaction of different poststructural narratives blah blah privileged class holding onto hegemonic dominance by selfserving claims of understanding blah blah eve is always has been and always will be a pvp game its possible to play team fortress ii with 15 other guys who are all playing medics its still a pvp game its possible to mine in eve eve is still a pvp game some people simply dont understand what eve is all about they come to the game after trying wow or whatever and dont understand that while wow has pvp and pve servers eve is one big pvp server and there are no options for a 100 pvpfree game they also dont understand that ccp deliberately made eve so that its cruel harsh and dark and advertised piracy as part of the draw of the game in their new player faq ccp states that darwinian competition is the very essence of the game so rather than adapt they whine like deliliah they pile dishonesty onto their lack of basic comprehension while they suggest that for instance nerfing the already disadvantaged lowsec pvpers is really in everybodys best interest theyre people who would be much happier on a pve server or in a singleplayer game instead they join a pvp game and begin whining that people are allowed to pvp with them a bit like joining a tf ii match and complaining that guys keep shooting your medic
i see it as part of the game development prioritiesif you dont know what is happening in the game developing and fixing it become a guesswork and every change you make make it even more of a guessing game look the insurancemission loot changes the original dev blog stated something on the tune of the loss in revenue for the mission runners will be partially compensated by an increase in the value of the minerals in the remaining lootsomething should have convinced ccp that the mission loot plus the drone alloys where inputting a lot of minerals in the game a quantity so large that removing part of the mission loot and reworking the drone alloys would cause a shortage and increase minerals prices even with the insurance changesthat didnt happened so somewhere they failed in the data gathering it could be that they underestimated the number of ships selfdestructed for the insurance overestimated the reprocessed minerals including in the count the modules used for mineral compression or overestimated the effect of the drone alloys changeswhat is important is that ccp made a change to the game using unreliable data and conclusions now we have pi and ccp will be tweaking it on some data gathered in some way there is a large risk of false informations and conclusions as the effect of the stockpiles and reprocessing exploits is far from finished i think now that you see why i feel that for the csm and the eve players it will be important to know the nonexploitable part of how the data are gathered and elaborated to eventually suggest better tools and corrections for the development of the game
ah i guess i wasnt being clearthe progress has come more recently after the minutes furor whether coincidentally due to continued csm pressure or due to responses to the minutes our dialog with devs has increased on a few different topics and ccp has also indicated that there are some csm issues that have gotten love as i stated over at shc no great leaps for evekind on the issues but every step forward is progress and for that i am happy to give credit where it is duehaving to constantly push for even incremental changes to process with ccp is frustrating and exhausting tbh but as long as there is even minimal progress ill happily keep leading the charge im nothing if not determined when i have my sights set on a goal
well said  i agree the backlog can either be the product backlog or the more detailed sprint backlog youll not get anything into the sprint backlog if there is no master entry in the product backlog so the first thing that needs to be done is getting ui changes into the product backlog however as suggested by krans there are more important issues to push for imho
2 bigger legacy content elephants are rockets and afs they have been around longer then fw they effect more ships and players then fw and low sec hell the damn font is more of a problem then fw or low sec to be frank the font affects everyone ships that can use rockets are nurfing themselves i love the ishkur but feel like a moron flying one since i can do the same job but better and cheaper and be more likely to survive in a vexor go af gono one said that pi is legacy content it is new content i dont consider it to be part of that 20 that ccp is talking about if it was they would not be dealing with any other topic at allthere is progress lets see the low sec luv bs rats in belts there will be more ratters l5 missions no longer spawning in high sec now everyone will move to do them in low sec oh wait no one cares abotu the rats in the belts and people who did l5 missions in high sec just stopped doing them low sec is a trashy wasteland as i stated in my above post you can not buff enough to make pveers go there until you nurf the hell out of pirates to the point where they cry a new ocean over it no one wants to be the sheep to be fleecedgoing back to the beginning font af rockets all more important then low sec they affect everyone low sec helps a very small group of people the smalls in eve sec status wise fw is a subset of low sec they would be wasting development cycles to work on low sec and fw ccp has bigger fish to fry stop being a small fish
ah excellent thanks for the clarification and as always for your efforts of course im still baffled why ccp would leave the csm issues getting no love threads out there like turds steaming in a punchbowl if they had progress they could be reporting but thats ccp for ya i guess
you fail at reading comprehension andor summary so no point in a response to you
if they removed them they still would not go away you have evesearchcom if they were removed then players would raise hell about censorship ether way it is a lose lose for ccp better to let it lie0 ignoring someone with a perspective that is counter to yours you win
ignoring someone who cannot comprehend my perspective you bet i win
its the 30th now and has this been fixed yet
i hate to resort to this but ankh alt much
then why did you resort to it your supposed to be above the fray representing all players to ccp not playing the forum troll clown
sometimes a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
a man lol
you are so sexist its not even funny for someone who wants eve to turn into a nice hellokitty style single player rpg you sure do have interesting standards about how you treat others
my mom told me once long ago that i would grow up to be a man youre not calling her a liar are you
touche absolutely not
if anything just tweak the build cost they are much more palatable now that you can pick them up for under 400m  perhaps tweak it downwards further the short range is an annoyance and could possibly be increased but lots of the ideas here are barkingas far as the sin goes i quite like it as is aligns and warps almost as fast as vagabonds when used correctly and is all round very versatile  it doesnt need changing into a carbon copy of the other black ops but if the damage were to be beefed up change the 5 bonus to a 75 bonus instead of crazy ideas involving changing models and adding extra turrets never going to happen

this man has it right just because i park my bike outside the police station down the block doesnt mean i 100 feel its safe sure its less likely to get stolen but i wouldnt be surprised if i walked out and it was gone
it would be nice to be able to autopilot from gate to gate without having to worry about getting ganked but its the hard truth in eve that you just cantand its just a fact that people flaming the op are themselves opertunist and like to grief others but  hapens its something you have to live with in eveop missioning sucks anyway
quote failyou might be onto something here has this been suggested before
thats what im saying i think the way youve phrased your suggestion its closer to what id think of as an assassination contract than a replacement for the bounty systemit requires killrights which the current bounty system does not you dont mention security status which is a requirement in the current bounty system its not clear if multiple bounties can be placed into the same pool or if multiple bounty placements would be multiple bounties this isnt how i would think of a bounty system but its probably just me being backward
a way to auto populate the system could be for people who suicide gank to recieve an automatic bounty from concord as another punishment for pirate activity in hi sec space their turf
this is not a bash the suicide gankers idea suicide victims can use the system as anyone else canpopulation can be accomplished by ranking the existing bountys to set a framework for the divisions yes a lot of people will deliberatly get podded to avoid this but with the amount of kills that happen every day it will not take long for it to become reestablished
only the idea is far from perfect and as such u still have not answered how allianceconnected bounty targets would be viable since allied players can roll a bounty mission with their alliance mates as targets and work with the target to collect more isk and wipe their slate clean just like in this current bounty systemhell it can even be exploited as a new method to farm killmails off of bounty hunters alt a kills alt b in low sec victim transfers kill rights to bounty agent bounty hunter goes into low sec00 and gets blown up by the blob the alts set for himin both cases your broken bounty system is exploitedfirst one for the bounty itself similar to the current system the second one is to lure the bounty hunter into being farmed just like in the current system in both cases theyre exploited in low sec00 leaving the targets there invaliduntouchable while only the high sec targets remain viable which goes back to an attempted suicide gank nerf u can scream troll some more if u want and spam that report button in an effort to remain blissfully ignorant since its obvious and hilarious ure unwilling to acknowledge let alone refute the arguments presented to u but dont be surprised when your broken idea doesnt go through
point 1  you cannot pick up targets that are members of your alliance or corppoint 2  your never told of the targets name just a code number and region some kind of scanning  locator does the restpoint 3  the target is random within your current available division you do not get to pick and choose yes i am aware that someone could get a buddy that hands them half the bounty or pull alongside them when they finally see who the target is  maybe tie this in with total isk lost minus insurance as part of the reward the idea is to make it a lot harder to abuse the system but with any pvp system you cant account for all peoplepoint 4  your posts were reported because you were trolling coming up with decent arguments is the way forward not shouting your a suicide gank victim you hate all suicide gankers etc etc  its is simply and ive said it enough times untruepoint 5  your persisting with this idea that the bounty hunter will be stupid and that the target will always be in a blob give people more creditpoint 6  your now venturing into paranoia with this idea that you could farm bounty hunters yes there will be ezmode targets just like there is for empire ganks however there will also be much tougher ones bear in mind that this is a chance for people to prove just how good they are yes it will likely take a lot of patience scheming and planning to pull off a sucessfull attack against a well prepared foe thats the idea thats what makes it funpoint 7  stop acting like a victim this is not a damned witch hunt against suicide ganking hell lets make point 8point 8  anna lifera is immune to all of this cos it might interfere with her gameim not claiming the idea is perfect but its certainly more credible than the current one and with some work to address some clear issues might even work i think all apart from your comments have been broadly supportive does that tell you something

well i am seeing a high  of support herehowever as a new player to this game i can only say this will make new player life pain in the assas a new player i am waiting for alot of skill to get train i am in no shape or form to pvp with my current ship and skill point low in isk means i cant afford to keep losing implants ships and stuff fitted on it1 price will go up very high possibility a big problem for new players2 places i can fly around safely now i would have to avoid with this change including agent of my faction corp located in another empire3 how the hell players other then gallent going to do soe epic arc4 except for a few brave souls most new players will not see other empire for monthswith all the above said this proposed change is a great deterrent for new players and only benefit the olduntil someone can convince me otherwise thumb down

rhok relztem55192529152224326263my suggestion link  post 25honorable mention  11891thru7  oh hell their all good suggestions and needed this was tough keeping it to 10
im a little confused  what are we voting for i asked you earlier if there had been any communication with ccp the reason i asked was to get a better understanding of why there is currently room in the product backlog for ui improvements and not functional improvements i personally dont give a hoot about all the ui stuff mentioned here scan colors  give me a freakin break the csm should push for the core issues lag low sec fw etc having said that then its a great initiative i just think its sisyphus work
i had this idea when i was in the csm and i could see it being an implementation that would breathe some new life into the game the following is my ideathe idea for small player owned structures has been presented before but i submit a thoughtout design that minimizes both code and art while giving a further purpose to the ships in the game the details are included belowthe shipbased habitat means it will start out as a ship this ship can be flown as a normal ship but will have special modules that highly limit its effectiveness on the combat side without making the ship completely useless either cruisersize or battleshipsize rigs can be bought and fitted to the appropriate sized shipusing lps a player can purchase a monthlong lease in an area of deadspace in the system there can be two deadspace locations in a system and the players go there to set it up these deadspace areas have an acceleration gate to limit the transportation to all subcapital shipsthe transformation process leaves the ship entirely defenseless for 15 minutes so other ships are often needed as protection while a ship transforms at the end of that period the player can either eject in a pod or in one of the ships left in the cargohold usually a shuttle and the ship becomes anchored to the location in spacea player can have as many sbhs as he has levels of the skill habitat management rank 4 he can only have one in a system though and there can be a maximum number of habitats in a system equal to some developerdecided system such as moons the sbh is considered a part of the person or corp so other corp members can have access to them if given the permissions and attacking them in highsecurity space will only not cause concord interference if the corporations are at warin the sbh mode up to 2 ships of an equal or smaller size can dock with the sbh these ships use a gangway to link them to the sbh so that theyre outside the armor and inside the shield of the sbh while docked at a sbh the pilot can engage certain modules on the ship to allow it to function as a very limited pos and these functions will run until complete either the sbh runs out of fuel the function runs out of the necessary components for the activity or the pilot stops the processcertain modules can be used for a sbh but it can also use any other passive module designed for a ship of its type such as hull modifications or anything else guns are activated automatically when attacked with a skill level of 1 unless the antitheft system is on the sbhwhen the sbh is deployed regardless of size the device doubles the hp of the ship and burns 10 isotopes of the appropriate type for the ship used as the basis every hour and 1 oxygen per day modules which double the fuel are marked with 2x and stack with one another so a factory and a refiner would quadruple fuel costsmid slotssystem scanner detects the people in systemcloaked statussecurity status detects ship type within 5 auantitheft system detects and immediately evemails if the sbh is attacked augments guns with the users skill levelsdrone coordinator automatically manages and launches drones if attacked uses the skills of the deployerlow slotsrefiner 2x refines ore at 1 m3second and ice at 1 unit5 minutes otherwise works as a refining arrayrepair bay enables repairs of t1 ships the percent damaged is the cost to repair in total ship materialsmunitions factory 2x assembles ammunition from raw materials at 10 higher costrig slotstransformation augmentor this is the cruisersized rig adding 10000 m3 to the cargohold of the ship when deployedimproved transformation augmentor this is the battleshipsized rig adding 40000 m3 to the cargohold of the ship when deployedany commentary or constructive criticism is welcome
bunyip i understand the reason behind your idea i was thinking more along the lines of creating a purpose for low sec your idea seem to just create a form of player housingi feel that your ship would have to be capital size to do the things you want it to do unless those modules snap on to the outside somehowit sound like it would be hard to find unless someone bm the location of it so would pirates be able to knock on your doorif it is found it cant be as strong as a pos poses have been made to be a corporate scale space base with many purposes therefore what ever is made for individuals can not be equal to that i hope you can see the direction i was going since i feel that our two ideas change the game in different ways
yea i had a different idea for this as well i dont think it should be a ship that does it it should be a item in your cargo hold as will the acceleration gate you anchor in deadspace to limit the ships it should deffinatly be catpure able that would actually get a use for marines certain amount of time the marines spend in there they come closer to capturing the resupply base and its not supposed to be ing god awefull good at defense just a meteoker defense 5 mil structure easy to defend if you spend alot of time in that system
sorry but i dont think i understand you ecm ships as it stands now are quite close range since without range bonus you get about 50 kms optimal on racials two ships have range bonuses the kitsune which while a good ship being a frigate means it has almost no place in large scale warfare and the scorpion the scorpion is already gimped by the fact that its a t1 ship and thus lacks the double set of bonuses plus its paper thin compared to most bss and indeed many bcs as well and finally it even gets half the ecm bonus the rookfalcon get and still 5 less than the kitsune getsalso the range is still quite low especially for bs fights unless you spend many slots on sig distortion amplifiers and jam range rigs which both impair heavily their already gimpy tank ecm rigs even more so since not only they take the space youd have filled with extenderstrimarks they also have a shield malus 5 at max skill per rigso basically you get extreme range on a frigate well for frigate fights at least medium longish range for cruisers and short range for the bs the range on cruisers is about all right on the kitsune is kinda wasted since racials hit around 50 km without boosts around 80km range on the scorpion is close range territory pulsepoc  scorch  100 km optimal and thats a close range weapon with bad strenght useless dps and failtanki stand by my previous post ecm is fine if anything ecm platforms need a little balancing
our ecm pilots  scorpion ecm is 96km opt falloff 53km 68ehp 8 points a mod falcon ecm 68 km opt 53 falloff 15 poits a mod blackbird ecm 110 km opt 80 falloff 10 poits a mod griffin ecm 71 km opt 53 falloff 10 poits a mod over powered nuff said nuff the ecm ships
ahem typical bs sensor strength around 20ish jam chance per single jammer little over 30typical engagement range for bss either 150 180 km or close ranges of around 50 kmtypical bs ehp over 100k ehp close range bs are univocally armor tanked due to rr fits sucking with shield transportersscorpion ehp 70k ehp many of which are shield which wont be tanked in said close range bs fit caseso yeah youre kinda proving my pointrange on the cruisers is kinda ok though it gets easily outdone by sniper hacs the strength is higher true but thats about it since you have low ehp and are a primary target also many cruisers have strong sensor strength even higher than bss especially the most likely targets for jamming recon ships and logisticsthe blackbird is nice but like i said above range is not that useful for cruisers and as a t1 ship it has even less of the already quite laughable ehps the t2 versions havei wont comment on the griffin since the tier system makes it basically unusable the kitsune instead would be quite a nice platform though the limited number of midslots lower strength and basically inexistent ehp its a frigate afterall mean that it has very limited uses perhaps in small gangagain you said nothing which doesnt prove exactly what ive been saying ecm is fine the platform could use a little work especially the scorpion
a scorpion doesnt take any more training than most other battleships require to be effective and it arguably needs less since its probably the battleship you can fly effectively and be the most use to your fleet while having low sp that said i dont think ships should be balanced on how long they take to train for i think ecm should be rebalanced rather than nerfed it needs a complete rework
i am aware that i ignored the tier 2 ew capability on them but i still think its a fair comparison the reason is because the ecm ships get several bonuses to ecm while the other ew ships only get 12 bonuses per type as an example the pilgrim gets a 5 td bonus and 20 neut amount bonus per level it does not get any additional ew bonuses the falcon gets a 30 ecm strength bonus and a 10 ecm cap usage bonus per level but notice the tech 1 hull only gets a 15 bonus not 30 thats 3x ecm bonuses on the falcon 2x of them being strength if my pilgrim had a 10 td bonus instead of 5 youd have a fair point though i still think things would be unbalanced in favor of the falconedit i should add that you dont have to dedicate all your mids to ecm on a falcon or any other ecm ship i have a scorp that has 90k100k ehp while shield tanked and can still jam 2x bss 75 of the time you choose to fit the falcon with nothing but ecm in the mids but thats a choice you made you dont have to do it that way the falcon can have a very solid shield tank with enough jammers to take out 23 key targets still logistics ew tacklers given that the other recons can only take 1 key target out of the fight id say thats 200300 overpowered this is why most people dont tank ecm ships and go all out with jammers however they suffer the penalty of being made of wet tissue so id say that overall its no better than my tanked setups in the long run
please for the love of god
from my point of view there seems to be one thing particularly odd about the sovereignty mechanics in eve in many circumstances one alliance may wish to cede one or more stationssystems to a friendly partner or to a renter however ive noticed that while eve has welldeveloped mechanics for hostile takeovers of systems and stations theres no way to peacefully transfer sov between allies  the normal mechanics more or less have to be followed as if it was a hostile takeover this seems to go against any idea of realism to me look at realworld politics states and conflicts there are many examples where territory has been transferred from one administrator country though sometimes smaller divisions as well to another as the result of an agreement convention of 1818 for example or a purchase louisiana purchase gasden purchase etc or some other circumstance there are many historical examples of each case in other cases it could be following a conflict territory gets ceded from a losing party that has surrendered to a larger party and simply hands over the territory while keeping a smaller portion of their territory mexicanamerican war regarding the presentday us southwest throughout history while in some cases territory changes hands as the result of epic and bloody battles there are numerous cases in which territory has changed hands through the stroke of a pen therefore in the spirit of making the political environment in 00 more realistic i propose some kind of mechanic to facilitate the peaceful transfer of sovereignty and stations between alliances currently sovereignty and stations can be transferred to different corps within an alliance but not between alliances i believe making such a mechanic would add another dimension to 00 politics and perhaps even influence objectives in major campaigns for example if alliance x is fighting alliance y and alliance y is struggling and wishes to surrender some sort of agreement can be reached wherein alliance y gives up the fight and peacefully transfers the bulk of its territory to alliance x peacefully rather than alliance x having to grind through the remainder of alliance ys holdings similarly as i said before this mechanic could be used to transfer sov between friendly alliances or between a larger alliance and its renterspets i realize one concern some players may have is that this could remove an opportunity for fights in that right now sov cannot be transferred directly from one alliance to another only from a neutral state to a claimed state meaning currently even in friendly sov transfers theres at least an 8 hour window where while a new tcu is onlining everything in that system is vulnerable and another alliance can interfere and throw a wrench in the process however i feel removing this for the sake of realism is worth it and there would still be plenty of opportunities for fighting over sov sovholding alliances can be viewed as political entities akin to states and therefore should be able to act as such and in my view this means making sovereignty more a political and administrative matter and less of a military one just as it often is in real lifethoughts on this
i also recognize some people may have concerns about this being abused  for example if an alliances sov is about to be taken over or become vulnerable they simply get around it by transferring it to a friendly entity and resetting the process so to speaktherefore i propose that there be two limits on peacefully transferring sov in a system the alliance holding the system to be transferred the originator must have held that space for at least 28 days the originating alliance must not have had its sovereignty threatened ie the system sbud in the system they wish to transfer for at least 14 days
does make sense why not
you want realism in an internet spaceship game where a typhoon does 100x less damage than the equivalent tonnage of rifters lashed together combat ships can only fit at most eight items per slot type ships in space accelerate to a maximum speed and then some sort of space resistance slows them if they cut engines asteroid belts magically appear every morning between 1100 hours and 1200 hours all governance in the galaxy is based on corporations it is impossible to anchor structures in space away from celestials wtf is anchoring anywayi could go on at length for pagesno more appeals to rldespite foolish attempt at justification ops actual idea might be goodhow about discussing if it would make the game better or not is the ability to hand over space quickly good or should it be a risky venture that requires dropping sov in a systemdoes current mechanic have impacts on the carebearing indexes of a system is that good or badare renters good for the game or do the mess it up how does this apply to thatapply some thought to game balance and reasonings not to the gasden purchasethat is all have a nice day
yeah myself im used to converting timezones due to my job but with the younger folk or just about anyone else that simply dont want to do simple math everytime they want to check the clocki think its a good idea i agree that eve time shouldnt be removed it should just be used as the universal time just like we have in real life with the unix epoch i mean i find myself checking the time like three times just to confirm its what i thought it was there really is no need for the complexity eve time  local time should both be shown on the clock too as i said though the biggest problem is when eve time is the next day for you that really confuses the crap out of things
instead of fighting paying the war deccer to cancel the war or hiring mercs players can join npc corps or form new shadow corps to immediately not become valid wartargetsoften they immediately rejoin their old corp when the war ends unfortunately ccp has deemed this not an exploithowever a simple fix is to make players who were at war at the time of the wardec remain at war for a week even if their new corporation isnt at warsomething similar can be used on corps that leave their alliance to avoid a wardec corps who leave their alliance while it is at war will remain valid war targets for a week without the need to redeclare waras a game mechanic wardecs are a good way to make highsec carebears actually risk something and they should prevent people from opting out of pvp its one thing to stay docked up and fight smart fights but eve is a pvp game and there should be no opting out of pvp itself
i know theere is a hot debate about fixing over adding when it comes to eve and i can see the need for both up front ccp has succeeded in creating a succesful business and a layered space game where numerous other game companies have failed or were only partially succesful ccp should be commended for this freelancer was brilliant and its original designers who also created privateer and wing commander had a concept very similar to eve microsoft pulled the plug on development because it kept growing the project and delaying release the result was a stunning game that was incomplete and limited in capability egosofts x series showed the stunning potential of improving graphics and adding complexity but presented a game that was broken often unstable and repeatedly in need of major fixes both of these games pioneered concepts and achieved things that many scifi fans had wanted for years but technology limits and lack of corporate vision always worked against themwhat most of us scfi fans want is not an excellent strategic game or arcadefirst person shooter or trading gamewe want immersion in a believable scifi world with the freedom to do as we please and watch it unfold so im not addressing the need for feature patches or fixes but suggesting something in line with creating a richer universei would like the capability to have multiple players man the same shipto serve as actual crews like corporations the ceo captain would have final say and control but would also have the ability to use the skills of crew members when operating his or her shipit would give new players a way to jump straight into battle and advanced actiopn and to learn at the same time while also gaining rep and isk for shared missions and the like others could specialize as gunners or engineers and ship owners could decide if taking a crew was worth the risk of the advantage that might be gained i think ships should continue to operate as they currently do but also have the ability to take on a small number of crew commensurate to their size and capabilities specific crew slots could be created allowing players filling them to control part of a ships operations incarna is a step towards this sort of thing already and i think this adds to the game without requiring complete new inventions certainly many bthings in creating crew must be similar to ambulation in stations by multiplayersthanks for the notice look forward to comments if this is a repeat thread apologiesi didnt see one similar when searching
problem is this would require development of eve online the spaceship gamewouldnt you prefer it if multiple players could wander around the same clothes shop in stations
i think with all the lag issues or even under normal circumstances this is unworkable due to this being an online game theres simply too much latency for this to be useful the guy doing gunnery would become inadvertently desynchronized with the guy doing navigation etc i just cant on a technical level see this working well its simply too much information for the server to process and to coordinate whos doing what and where the ships going and what its doing and to reflect the correct status back to all players not to mention the player skill involved even under perfect circumstances to all operate a ship in unison
i think a 2 day total that includes time to anchor and online the adu time for it to unanchor a pos is good and 5075 mil cost if you do use an adu in low sec without a wardec then you still get the sec hit just like attackingdestroying a ship would give you in pvp im not sure if you should require a wardec in highsec or not im on the fence about that one
not supportedah pirate tears he wants moar pvh pirate vs hauler because he didnt  enough at 14but yeah pve in lowsec is crap if you loose a pve battleship to a bunch of elitepvpers youve been wasting your time for the past 45 days especially in minmatar space where lp stores are used only for 5 implants profit is with luck and time  1 isk  1 lpnot supported because this solution is only favoring pirates with highsec mission alts  like this champ right heresimply boost the industrial  belts and station facilities advantages in lowsec 60 of the chars have good industrial skills or more boost the faction warfare and the missions given by the militia corps

as a new player little over two weeks i already experienced a wardec shortly joining a player corpi chose to stay with the corp only lost one badger but also stayed docked for the last 3 days of the wardeci know eve is a heavy pvp game i know i can leave the corp i also know that i can choose to fighthowever as all old player know the saying only fly the ship you can afford to lose to new player every ship lost is a big set back due to low isk skill books ccost isk ammo cost isk weapon cost isk so every ship lost maybe a cruiser or even destroyer can be a big lost to a new playerleaving corp is an option but a bad one as that is properly the place for us to make new friends and hopefully for long termon skill point front we are in no shape or form to fight or defend ourself effectivelystaying docked means not doing mission ruining the game play and income for new playerso maybe for new player there should be an option to exempt from wardec outline as follow qualification of exemption base on age of account not character for example only account less than 6 weeks old can use that option so alts of older account dont receive this option the exemption only apply inside highsec has no effect in lowsec and nullsec it is only a wardec exemption means they are not automatically red to the opposition corp but all other rules still apply so they still turn red if take part in the wardec fight or even stay red for the rest of the period of current wardec they still turn yellow if doing aggression action towards nonwardec players exemption only available to qualify members of a corp not the whole corpps play with evemon abit change from 3 months to 6 weeks
janos saalreason other than easy killmailedit i fight if i can afford to replace
if your corp isnt ready to defend itself its not ready to be a corpyoure assuming that forming a corp is something very new players should be entitled to do in safety why nothing else in eve is safe why this
really nothing is safe then why is there highsec what about npc station docking why most ships are remove from space when player logoffhighsec is a starting point of eve this has nothing to with old corp new corp big or smallthe advantage to old player are minimized with account age limitation not character agemultiple accounts is an out of game mechanic so dont count in this argumentfor old players they can send isk from old accountcharacter and this is not even an issue for them at all
i have to agree with this forming a new corporation is a decision newer players have options stick with npc corps until they are ready to deal with the potential of war decs join an established pc corp that already knows how to deal with war decsthe act of creating a new corp is a statement to the galaxy we are here we are strong enough and smart enough to compete with you all perhaps your group made that statement a little too early theres nothing wrong with that its just a learning experience instead of adding safety bumpers to the game just evaluate the result of your decisions and make a new plan
maybe i didnt made it clear the exemption is applied to individual player not to the corp so if a corp got wardeced only members qualify have that option not the whole corp
you dont need to stay docked evenhere is a useful resourcea destroyer warps quickly and takes a little time to scan down so go ahead and run some missionsedit but i do think this is a good suggestion 3 months is a bit way too long in my opinion though 2 weeks i could supporti just need to ask why isnt your corp supplying you with ships and equipment to fight in the war frigates are not expensive and can serve a few very useful roles
hisec isnt the starter area nor is it intended to be safeyour stuff isnt even completely safe in station you can get scammed and it does happen or your corp can be robbed by a rogue memberif a new player feels that his corp is not able to defend itself he should leave it and join one that can protect him until such time as he is ready artifical constraints on other players wont work because if they rely on these constraints theyll never learn to defend themselves thus they will be just as badly off when their new player status expires what kind of timescale did you have in mind for that 2 weeks a month 6 monthsno what youre basically asking for is a pvp flag and the answer to that is the same as it always has been no
the problem with your idea is that it is open to heavy abuseolder players will simply make a few newbie alts and go spy on various other corps or individuals with impunity better yet with a bit of training they could use their newbie characters as rr support while yelling cant touch this dun du na nahh nuh naaa nuh naaathe point of highsec is to be safer than in low or null sec you are still prone to wardecs suicide ganking ninja salvagersflippers etc you are in a nutshell a fully developed player from day oneas for why there is highsec originally there was no highsec and no concord both were brought in some years ago when enough riskadverse people yelled hard enough the devs who had originally intended for a risky game went with a middle of the road solution giving systems a security level and instituting penalties for certain hostile actions said actions were still permissible though over the years concord has been buffed the first concord could be tanked and buffed again the hisec you know is probably the safest it has been in years some people might take issue with this thoughso yeah from my perspective this is a case of what you sow is what you reap if you cant actively defend you corp you either need to disband it or go to another corp that can defend itself and dont knock established corps or be put off by those with sp requirements if you have a good attitude and a willingness to learn then quite a few of them will take you in and show you the ropes the fact that you want to fight this wardec despite being a newbie will make you a hot commodity among pvp corps and pirates not supported
i can understand where you are coming from battle mage however what you experienced is what eve is about everyone vs everyone to have only lost a badger you got a pretty easy welcome to eve i know that sounds harsh but this game can be far harsher thats part of the appeal to the game normally id be all for helping a new player out or nerfing wardecs in highsec but on this i must agree with everyone else with joining a pc corp you can make friends and earn more isk by working together but with greater profits normally comes greater risks and the risk of being wardecd is one of those risks every pc corp takes on i love playing this game even with all the conflictscams i must look out for but there is a reason this pic was made eve learning curve
spying can be done today without this posposal each pay account can have 3 21days trail account each month or just sigh up another trail account and i believe people in nullsec can easily get plex to keep them going you dont need credit card to sigh up or paid for this gamenot sure what is rr thoughi agree eve is a very hostile environment however just as how highsec come into place new measure should be consider as the game get older the overall starting experience is very unfriendly if not hostile for new player a new limited buffer should be consider and this proposal has a time limit on account it dont go indefinitely like highsec for everyonepeople in nullsec and lowsec properly dont care but there are pvp corps that will wardec whatever large or small corpalliance and only go after new players in highsec area like arnon they have enough standing or enough friends with standing with locator agents and chase down people on their list it is pain in the ass to see them in local even i move 17 jumps away
this is how it should be i can understand giving new players a small buffer to learn how the game works which tbh is what npc corps are for you can join one at any time by quitting from your corp but eve is  by design  an extremely harsh game
im not supporting the npc but no one is going to stay in this game long if all they can do is be in a silent npc corp and earn money to be able to one day have decent enough sp and funds to get into a corp there are better solo mmos to play its important that newbies are retained and encouraged to find and be in corps

not really important issue on my list but sure why not if some people have trouble immersing
a search option for the forums would be nice beeing able to find all posts from a certain poster or anything else you can search for realy
fully supportedi followed the advice and have a rather long password with capital letters numbers etc its annoying to type it in every fricking time if i save the password it would defeat the purpose of having it anyway especailly when i mistype i have to go at it again
i see the exploitation possible with this but supported anyway a warning message and the ability to deny people use of the orcas facilities would suffice
thread lockedthe assembly hall must be used to bring up serious topics for the consideration of the csm
like it or not pvp is the lynchpin of eve without it much of this game would shut downthe basic mistake that many in the its a sandbox first is making when they make their arguement is that they assume that pvp is all about blowing up spaceships i dont they they stop and consider that the playerdriven mechanics that bring pvp to other areas of the gameever jump into a belt to mine only to find its been stripped of every rock you just got pvpd by your competitionever find your buy orders massivly undercut you just got pvpd by your competitionjump back into your mission to find your salvage gone you just got pvpd by a ninjasalvagerpvp simply means player versus player while blowing up each others ships is a part of this its not the only pvp aspect of the game every part of eve is affected by this even on the basic level  who is going to buy your barges if they arent blown up to pretend that pvp is just an addon to the game is to be willfully ignorant of something that should be plain as dayto adjust this game away from its current state to something more wowish would be to strip its soul and create another nge situation in the mmo world

have highsec divided by a strip of lowsec systems and add reasons for players to go to one highsec to the other missions etc
there are missed points when people talk about getting players into lowsec the first is trying to force them to go there through making them go for missions making crossing lowsec unavoidable for a variety of reasons placing an industry or resource there and only in lowsec etc forcing people to do something is the wrong way to do it sandbox rememberideas about trying to get lawful players in is a nice suggestion but the inherent flaw is they are fighting for nothing other than trying to kill bad guys and why bother doing that when they can find other opportunities to kill bad guys and actually get something for it 00 wh space etc unless you make a fw type of mechanic for lawful players to be able to hunt and kill unlawful players in lowsec there isnt any incentive to do it for free when other avenues allow them to do basically the same thing and reap some real rewards the other problem with having players police space is they cant be on 237 and there is nothing compelling group of lawful a to go take on group of unlawful b as well as why would player b take the risk that anyone is going to protect him it is a nice idea but not one that has much chance of being viable without mechanics to support it as a lawful player why would i want to roam several lowsec systems to attack bad guys when i can do that in 00 or wh and protect something valuable while being part of a teamthe problems with lowsec are many and the possible solutions should also be numerous but they shouldnt focus on forcing people to play someone elses idea of what the game should be a big problem of lowsec is that most people just want to bash on someone else and plenty of people arent interested in getting bashed on i dont see a solution that has industrialists really going into lowsec regularly unless they are well guardedescorted and to bring that kind of firepower means the resources need to be valuable and limited to lowsec overdoing lowsec resources though could easily just turn into another situation where alliances are the only ones wielding the kinds of forces to acquire those resources putting some resources in lowsec and only lowsec is fine but it shouldnt be something needed now moved there but something else added so that those who dont want anything to go with it arent forced to now go there it would be nice if this resourceservice actually made sense as to why it cantwont work in highsec or 00wh the only things that come to mind are smuggling where the sourcedemand is only in lowsec stations as highsec doesnt allow it and 00 has no need for it
i always thought it would be cool if players would either have to jump through lowsec to get to other empires space quickly or make long hauls around in highsec so a path would exist to each empire in highsec but it would take awhile to travel throughthat way you dont have to go into lowsec but it is faster adds another sweet dynamic to the gamemaking players choose between slower but safer paths and quicker but more dangerous paths i can definitely see a lowsec traffic boost with this
1 the basic problem of low sec is that pirates dont need to get a positive cash flow from pirating as they will sustain the account missionrunning or trading with an alt and if that fail selling plexesso what they do is not pirating fleecing the golden lamb but leaving it alive but wanton destruction where you sunk the target ship and hope for some stuff to stay afloat in the sea as thing stay today you have too many pirates for too few targets pirates that will not try to ransom a target and that when they ransom will mostly not honor the ransom until that change there is no reason for law abiding players to go in low sec 2 seriously bad idea first for the above mentioned reasons it will take a very heavy toll on the people trying to pass through second it will divide high sec in 4 sectors and people will rarely move from one to anotherthird what system will you turn in low sec to create the divides you want you will take them from high sec a area with very few systems compared to the whole eve clustermove around some low sec systemchange some 00 system to low sec3 another wonderfully flawed idea i hope born of ignorance and not malice you know why the current bounty system dont work very simple as soon as the bounty is worth more than the clone of the pirate a friend or alt kill himadd your changes lets say the added bounty is 25 of the ship value when a guy has 10 standing enter insurance and the guy lose only 30 of the hull value of a empty ship after paying it get gcc shooting a can your palalt kill your shiphe get 50 of the hull value you get a net 70 of the hull valuenet result you share 20 of the hull value as net gainnot bad for some minute of shooting it will increase mineral demand at leastthat if your idea require only a ship kill if it require a pod kill good luck getting it we return to square 1 and the pirate will be killed by an alt when the total bounty with gcc bonus is high enough to pay for clone ship and a bonus the chance to get the occasional bounty will not motivate players to do the law enforcer part 4 subsidize the pirates you have already done that in point 3 but the poor guys need more incentives wrong if you want to improve low sec you need to cull the pirates until they are a very small percentage of the whole population not increase the numbers giving incentives what low sec need are gangs that extort protection money but grant a modicum of security to those that have paid not more random bandits on a killing spree the first kind of players will allow an increase in the lawful population the second will push it away what you need to invent is a system to push people toward becoming a mafia like organization selling protection to the people living in the area they control and keeping away the other extortionist the fights should be between the mafia gangs for turf control and against the people that dont want to pay protection not against any guy you see
try going from gallente to amarr or caldari and you will see your long trip
i agree with venkul there are already multitudes of game mechanics that make griefing piracy without regard to ransome or profit of any kind as simple as selling a plex or two a month and flying cheapfit ships if lowsec is ever to grow evolve or become changed in any way you can rest assured it will be at the expense of the current griefer lifestyle and not for the benefit of it there are very few things in lowsec that in any way  ones ability to kill whatever you please without consequenceand please spare us the but we cant get into highsec and the gate guns shoot at us nonsense it takes less than two days to make a neutral hauler alt on the same account if youre cheap and dont want a second account and a gate gun can be nearly infitanked by a drake and just about any other bc you care to fly
this 110 there are simply better uses for the money spent on csm upkeep with far better results youd think that would be a nobrainer in a country like iceland with its current economic troubles
