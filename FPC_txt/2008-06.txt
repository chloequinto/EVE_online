"i think that something should be done about moon materials, etc. but not this proposal.i don't think there is a problem with various 0.0 regions being more valuable (permanently) than others. the high value areas are where the big boys play and the low value areas are where people start out. similar to the progression from high sec to low sec to 0.0 in general. the issue i see is that the rarity of a moon material isn't a good gauge of it's value because of the reactions and uses of that material.dysprosium, promethium, neodymium and thulium are all of the same rarity and one would expect that they would be of the same approximate value, much like low sec ores are similar in price but not exactly the same. currently, dysprosium is twice as expensive as promethium and almost 50 times as expensive as thulium. this is because thulium is only used in producing 1 (per race) t2 component (which is only used in ships) whereas dysprosium is used in producing 5 (per race) t2 components.i believe ccp should look into balancing the uses of the various materials such that their price is more reflective of their rarity rather than simply which things they produce and which other materials they must combine with to produce them.the rarity system for moon materials is completely broken and making moons move around won't fix that.and btw, make abundance of moon materials useful in some way..."
"in short, no, i disagree jade, you've got a good thought, but perhaps a better idea would be this:all moons are given a greatly increased number of materials that can be mined, however this can vary from 2 (meaning double what you get now, if you use a t2 harvester if/when they are released), to 0.1, which would give a 10% yield.you would have alot more moons bearing rarer minerals, but in smaller amounts, and to prevent moon mining from being complete overkill, you would have a limit on the number of moon harvesters that could be present, or you would start getting severely diminished returns (on all harvester) if you have more than 2, maybe 3, at the moon.for example:star fraction pos #12 is currently at a moon with 2 atmospheric gases, and 1 platinum, harvesting both. my change comes into being, now your moon also has 0.8 cobalt, 0.5 technetium, and 0.3 dysposium.you stop harvesting the gases, and begin harvesting the dysposium, but you only get 30% as much, due to a 0.3 content in the moon. you then decide to gather technetium as well, however the 3rd harvester causes a reduced income of each harvester total (stacking penalty) and you receive 10% less from each harvester (now getting only 27% the dysp).imo, that would be better, as even the 'crappy' moons would have some value, and if people flood the market with valuable materials like dysp, they'll find themselves possibly changing their mining setup to collect something else for better profit."

"actually i only run courier missions. when i get tired of mining or have enough minerals for my latest production job i will run courier missions for a bit just to relieve the tedium. so assuming that no legit player would run one is completely wrong."
"alright, this is one issue i feel strongly about, and would like to make some points known:1) people talk about how macrominers help the game by providing scores of low-grade materials to allow pvp to occur cheaply. bs. the reason there are so few miners is because mining is so hard to make a profit at due to the macroers. eliminate the macroers, more real players begin mining. the prices on minerals may increase, but it won't be by that much. increase the excitement of mining (using the idea i posted in my csm bid helps, but other ideas are welcome), and make it as profitable as other ventures.2) ccp action. i use a 5-point test to determine macroers. while not foolproof, it does a good job of verifying that. i have reported over 100 verified macroers to ccp. any guesses how many of them are still in the game? the job ccp seems to be doing is similar to a fishing net. it catches the small fish, but the big whales break right through.3) interpol. i know this is making a huge jump and going out on a limb, but i think selling fantasy items for real money should be considered fraud. if interpol made this illegal, it would benefit all games. i know it's kinda a waste to post it on this forum, but i wanted to put the idea out there and see how likely it would be to occur.4) keystrokes. i think wow did this, but use a program that can access the kernel of the os and determine if the input is being delivered by a program or by a peripheral device such as a mouse. not foolproof, but it will go a long way to stopping the macroers.5) player advisors. i strongly support this measure, listed under a previous poster. more has to be done, and to be quite frank, is not being done. ccp has confirmed that this is a problem, yet refuses to take any steps to remedy this problem. for crying out loud, ccp has the biggest server farm in the industry, and recently acquired white wolf games. they have the money to stop this, considering 200k characters spread over roughly 100k accounts. 100k x 15 usd/month is 1.5m per month, most of which is probably subsumed in bandwidth charges. if we eliminate macroers (which are widespread), the bandwidth should be cut in half, as well as the workload required of the servers, meaning that the game will support more concurrent real players.i'm sorry to rant, but it drives me nuts seeing these macroers continue on their merry way. any miner will tell you ice mining is worthless due to the macromining invasion. i'm not trying to say that ccp is bad in any respects, but please, something has to be done..."
"as much as i'd like for it to be impossible for isk farmers to abuse this game, i can't get behind that sort of idea. the difference between that and what wow's warden does is not a large one. software such as warden will never be permitted to run on any computer owned by me. even if it worked to catch every single macro-user, it would do nothing to detect account sharing and sweatshop operations and would alienate regular customers."
"1) agreed. 2) i'd be curious to know about what this test is. and my guess is 100, just judging by how ****ed-off you sound. 3) you're crazy. isk isn't a \"fantasy item\" in the slightest. it may not have physical form, or anywhere near the same popularity, but it's as real as dollars or euros. and there's also a lot of mmos out there, to my understanding, that allow ebaying. besides, if you're going to argue that irl money for ig money should be illegal, you'd have to end the gtc trade, since that's nothing but cash-for-isk. this is why moralizing over rmt has always stunned me - we play a game whose developer actively encourages and facilitates rmt, and still manage to think it's evil? who's up for some cognitive dissonance?4) you're even crazier than you were on #3. if ccp starts installing spyware like that on my computer, it'll be a cold day in hell before they see another cent from me. 5) circa 500k characters over 250k paid accounts, actually. and i seriously doubt that macroers eat half their bandwidth. but that said, i'm not at all sure what sort of \"player advisors\" you want."
"i've never liked how crappy ab's are."
"it does not need to outright disable the mwd, but reducing the speed bonus is also possible."
"increasing the speedboos of ab even more feels wrong to me, i think a solution should be sought in the folowing direction.altering mwd's should also help reducing the ever present nanofits.for abhave them bestow 25% to 50% invulnerability to webs (25% in t1 meta 0 to 50% for t2 at max skill (yes, add a skill to boost webresistance) make sure faction ab's do not get above 70% ever)improve acceleration (not agillity) on active ab'sfor mwdhave mwd refuse to function whenever the ship would be unable to warp(i never understood why they could work when scrambled or in bubbles)"
"i'm fairly new and therefore don't know a lot about the subject, but the fact that it seems like *everyone* needs a mwd on their ship (... and judging from the commentary about nano gangs, this is even more true than complaints about nanoing...) to pvp suggests there's something wrong.(alright, you can shoot that down with \"everyone needs weapons on their ship,\" but there's a range of those, at least. i suppose you can also shoot that down with \"everyone needs a warp disruptor,\" too, but that's actually a far more tenuous argument.)also, i agree with everyone who doesn't understand how a microwarpdrive works when you're warp scrambled. on the other hand, with the tendency for everyone to be warp scrambled in a fight, as far as i can tell, means that would probably be a pretty heavy-handed nerf. (i still like it, though.)"

"ok, learning skills suck, but they shouldn't be removed from the game.increase starter characters' sp by 500,000 (probably not a realistic number) and put all these new sp in learning skills relevant to their career choice."
"i'd like to throw my 2 pennies into this here convo, now as a new player (3months or so) i believe learning skills are a good balance for the game, but alot of my mates who started out at the same time as me have left because of the riducilus training times on some of them, now i'm all for keeping them but for the newer player would it not be an idea good or bad to maybe decrese the training time on just the learning skills???? i dont mind happily trying to leave something running in my skills for 15-30 days for something like a dread, or carrier or something useful that helps me progress in the game, but spending 6-10 days as some of my mates have done learning skills like focus and learning just isn't a fun thing.decrease the training time and maybe some +10 learning implants would be nice for us newbies as were often called, but from my own expierence it would just give the game a nice big kick up the learning skills backside tbh and i for one would welcome that."
"an alternative to learning skills might just be an automatic acceleration of learning abilities over time. so for brand new players, a rank 1 skill might take 7 days to get to level 5, but for year old players it'll take 5 days, and eventually after a couple years will level off at 3-4 days (accelerating at a decreasing rate). that way new players (for whom rank 2 skills like racial frigate v are a big deal) will have to be patient for those skills, but older players (working on rank 16 skills and the like) will have accelerated training for the much longer skills they're working on."
"face it, learning skills are there to give ccp extra $15-$30 per character. it's a scam. you know, like that 90mil not-quite-navy caracal contract? same thing. we've all been had. the difference is, some of the suckers are foaming at the mouth, claiming that their shiny new it's-not-navy-srsly caracal is just as good.if you like learning skills so much, why aren't you asking for more time sinks? how about a rank-10 skill pointless waste of time, level 4 required to fly any cruiser or higher? anybody who doesn't like it can stick to frigates."

"local chat is in my opinion the number one intel gathering tool used by every pilot in lowsec and 0.0 space (highsec as well i suppose). i don't believe it was ever ccp's intention for it to be used this way, but that's the way it is. whenever someone enters a system, anyone paying attention to local chat will see that player show up, and can instantly know if they should run, log out, or start hunting them. it is still possible to get snuck up on when not paying attention to local, just as it is possible for a piracy target or war target to sneak by you when you're not paying attention, however it's a lot harder for any sneaking to happen at all.i'm trying to convey the fact that local chat makes things easier for npcer/miners to avoid pirates as well as well as making it easier for pirates/warring corps to find targets. hence a removal of all or part of the intel gathering features of local chat would make things harder for both sides.now, the first feature of local chat that i am suggesting be removed is the instantaneous display of a player's name and portrait to the chat window of other players when they enter the system, as well as the instantaneous display of everyone else's names and portraits to that player upon entering the system. this quite frankly gives everyone too much info without having to work for it. i suggest that this feature be changed to the delayed chat update that displays a persons name and portrait only when someone speaks in local chat. this would, as i said, make it harder for both predator and prey, so it wouldn't cause any imbalance. second, it would make the game so much more fun, which is of course the point of a game. you could enter a system as a pirate and not know if it was chock full of npcers and miners ripe for the picking, or if you would be chasing other pirates around the whole time (lol). as an npcer/miner you would have just a little more adrenaline pumping through your veins (mining and adrenaline? who would've thunk it?) because you never know when a pirate would show up on the scanner.what's that shnergin? scanner you say? yes you would most definitely still have some warning of a pirate being in the system because they would show up on the scanner when close enough. after all, they usually try to use the directional scanner to find you, and if they can see you on the scanner then you can see them. you only see their ship of course, but if an interceptor or recon ship shows up on your scanner, you can be fairly certain it is a pirate tackler perhaps for a larger gang not on the scanner... yet.now, not all information from local would or could be removed. for instance i'm fairly certain that you would still be notified when someone enters a system because the little number that indicates how many people are in local might have to stay. i say this because that information is accessible, in a way, through the galaxy map by coloring stars by \"average pilots in space in the last 30 minutes\". i'm not sure if this information is delayed, and i know it doesn't technically show you the current local count, but an increase in this number over time indicates someone jumped in. personally i would like the number of people in local to be removed as well, but if that means people will resort to constant checking of the galaxy map, then don't take it out just to cause an annoyance like that.one last area that needs to be covered is when someone's portrait should disappear from local chat. a timer from when they last spoke would be most appropriate i think, as having them disappear only when they leave system would provide unneeded intel and discourage talking.getting close to my character limit, so let me know what you think. if you would suggest different changes then post them and give a thumbs up only for the opinion that local needs some kind of change.this is my main and only character. it might just be my first post, i don't recall.edit: grammar"
"just want a little room here to link to (possible) later replies and ideas in (possible) future pages of the thread. and to give myself a thumbs up ."
"on one hand, reconnaissance is a good thing, especially in a game - you don't want pirates getting even more bored for lack of a target. on the other hand, too much recon is a bad thing, since it makes things too easy for all involved. the goal should be for any player who is looking to be able to find, without too much difficulty, and to make chat channels not be an intel source. the bit about making local not be an intel source is easy enough - either make it an optional channel(along with corp and alliance, for that matter - why does the game force me to keep open windows i don't want?), or make it a faces-not-shown channel like npc corp chat, or even both. but there needs to be compensation - you can't just have everybody flying around blind. the current on-board scanner is a good start, but it needs some work. for starters, its range is too short for a proper system scanner - i know why it's 2,147,483,647 metres(2^31-1, for those of you less mathematically inclined), but 14.3 au isn't nearly enough for a system scanner. how about you remove that cap, and make the time go from being a flat scan time to being based on how much volume you're scanning? say 1 second per au at 5 degrees, 2 at 30, 3 at 60, 4 at 90, 6 at 180, and 10 at 360? have a skill that reduces scan times by 10% per level or something, just to make it not take an obscenely long time for bigger scans. also, there needs to be some refinements to the process. first off, the aim point for the scan needs to be made explicit - perhaps have a \"scan cone\" show up when you have the scanner window open. secondly, while filtering by overview settings is nice, some added filtering options are needed, most notably \"exclude last scan's results\". also, i'm tempted to suggest either an advanced skill or a module to allow you to get better results from your scan data - here's a (very) rough draft of what i mean:scan filtering - rank 3, science tree(int primary, mem secondary)this skill allows the on-board scanner to receive added information when scanning.level 1 allows display of the object's type(e.g., drake/caldari control tower small) instead of merely its class(e.g., ship/starbase structure)level 2 allows display of the object's current speedlevel 3 allows display of whether the object is currently occupiedlevel 4 allows display of object's current hp(if you want this skill to be really good, make it absolute hp, if you want it to be less good, just a percentage of each type)level 5 allows display of the object owner's name(i.e., ship pilot or pos owning corp - this will be autolinked to allow for fast show info)it'd be cheap and have pretty low requisites, to allow new players to make use of it properly."
"this is stupid:for more information, see thiscloaking ships are already powerful enough, there is no reason to make them the only ship worth flying for roaming."
"what if they added a skill that gave you a chance to scan through a cloak(say, 10% per level for a standard cloak, and 5% per level for a cov ops cloak)? would that address your balance concerns? you do have a very good point here, but i'm loath to say that the current form of local is the only solution to the problem of cloaks being too good."
"i agree that the main problem will be with cloaking ships. i know they don't show up on probe scans, but i was under the impression that they showed up on directional scans. just a week ago i was able to see a force recon ship sneaking up on me using the directional scanner (and i let it happen so i could fight him). if cloaked ships don't show up on the directional scanner, then it will be easy for them to sneak up on an npcer/miner making this change unbalanced towards piracy. perhaps a slight change needs to be made to cloaks too then, either herschel's suggestion, or perhaps making them show up on the directional scanner 100% of the time, but with no distance listed. then if you happen to notice them on the scanner, you don't know if they're right next to you, or at a planet.on the topic of surprise attacks, it's entirely possible under my proposed changes to sneak up on an npcer/miner in an uncloaked ship by not scanning for it, and simply warping to a belt that is out of scan range and hoping to get lucky. you'll only show up on the npcer/miner's scanner for the few seconds of warping, however you have no guarantee that anyone will be at the belt to attack.i think that some ability to sneak around the directional scanner's limitations is a good thing, but that cloaked ships with a gang out of scan range will be bad for gameplay."
"nope, they do not when they are cloaked. are you sure it was a force recon and not a combat recon you were looking at?if you read the link you will understand why you can't just let cloaking ships show up on the scanner even in that manner.any mechanic that replaces local needs to have pretty much the same functionality as local does currently. you need to be able to know who is in system and you need to be able track them down and kill them, if you do not, risk is increased. people will blob up, gate camps will become more powerful as will traps of all sort. combat will become more scarce as people are more hesitant to engage without clear superiority and larger as people cling to numbers for security. the problems associated with local have little to nothing to do with the mechanic itself, but the mechanics that allow you to run from combat. specifically cloaking and logging off. fix the problems associated with running and you fix all the complaints about the local channel.this runs to two problems:1. everyone will be hitting the scan button every 5 seconds. 2. this is a game between the carebears and the attackers. the carebares need to be able to get away. its not like they are going to be able to defend themselves from an attacking gang."
"@ goumindongi did read the post that you linked to, but that post indicated that the current local functionality should be included in the scanner. meaning that you could see both what ships are out there as well as who is piloting each. i don't think peo"
"i would love an amount of randomness in missions.one idea would be to set a bounty limit for a mission. ships of the appropriate type could then be randomly selected until the bounty is reached. for example: mission x has a total bounty of 100k. this could be a large load of frigates, or a cruiser with some drone support, etc, but the bounties all total around 100k. would still want to limit the kinds of ships that can appear in certain missions - wouldn't want a battleship appearing in a l1, for example - but some randomization would be nice."
"now this i can go for. you'll need to make sure your npc tables are variable enough to make this randomness actually matter, but i think that's largely satisfied by the current system."
"i agree compeltely, also remove the tie between sec difference for highsec, doing missions in a 1.0->0.5 is on the same magnitude of risk. lowsec missions should keep the increased rewards."
"i agree...apart from the recent introduction of faction drones the only loving drones have got in the last two years has been some improvements on drone ai and some extra nifty interface improvements.then again... drones have a pretty stand alone set of skillz... and the other weapon systems only have the single unique weapon upgrade, albeit that they do have named and t2 variants... i think with the introduction of named and t2 variants of the drone upgrades, the drone-loving community would be quite happy for quite sometime.we have also had the introduction of ew, logistic, and combat utility drones, so we're not that hard done by... edit/ i just read the entirity of the op, and i see that i failed to grasp the your point. your issue being with the role that drones have in combat. im not sure that drones were ever meant to be more than a secondary weapon platform, or as a primary weapon platform on support/specialist ships i.e. my explorer of doom... ive got a huge amount of sps in drones, but will look to my hi-slots for primary dmg unless ive got some other role in gang.. logi, ew, smoking phat cones etc..."
"again, not wanting a change.not wanting your opinion on their use or how you thing ccp has treated their implementation.i am asking for someone to ask the devs about what are their intentions for drones. are they supposed to be primary weapons systems? will they introduce any implants for them? will they expand on them or keep making them \"secondary\" or support weapons systems. and a whole lot of questions that only ccp can answer.are drones a dead end/ support only due to lag considerations?this also includes the answer being posted for all to see.now if you support this question being asked please say so.if you dont want someone to ask ccp about drones say so.outside that there is little to discuss.thank you."
"i like the idea. maybe let the wreck be accessed in space like a pos array, only it's your personal hangar, so you can try to save your stuff, but can't refit or anything. also could allow the rebuilding of the wrecked startion for 50-75% of the cost.a true, 100% wiped out outpost idea would be cool, but i can't see it going in simply because lots of players would stick to npc stations when able if it means they could login one day and find their assets gone forever that were in a station.especially players that come back after a long time."
"yes"
"nothing would make the largest alliances in the game even stronger than they are today. now, not only would we get to take your space but we wouldn't have to bother defending it after destroying your stations.unless you want to make large alliances even stronger and make small ones even weaker you will vote to not present this to ccp."
"for me it feels wrong as well that anything a player can build cannot be destroyed by other players.however i think the conqereble stations should be included in the list of destroyeble structures. these were the first iteration of player owned stations and they should be included in the same mechanics.i agree that a station should be taken and controlled before it can be destroyed. i also think that a cost reduction for reconstruction is a good idear.using the pos based corp hanger mechanic to access your hanger in a destroyed pos also feels right somehow, even including the refit option normaly availeble in this mechanic does not feel immersionbreaking to me."
"as horribly painful as it is for me to agree with goumindong, i do on this issue.weak alliances are only allowed to exist in 0.0 because taking their space would overextend the powerhouse alliances. if stations were destructible, the powerhouses would mow them over, pop the stations, and move on.it sounds great at first glance, but in reality it simply wouldn't work. its taken years for 0.0 infrastructure to become what it is, destructible stations would make 0.0 a no man's land with a handful of super-powerful citadels occupied by bob, -a-, and the like."

"now alot of us have flown in, and around 0.0 space and i know that pretty much anything goes, and im all for this and such, but one thing i believe should not be allowed is afk cloaking, it considerably slows the game down, especially when you want to go out and rat/mine e.t.c. e.t.c.now this is not to say all cloaking is bad, i like it but i logged out at the we hours this morning, and when i left we had 4 hostile's somewhere afk cloaked in our system just sat god only knows where.i've come back online this afternoon and low and behold the afk cloakers are still there (what a surprise), so i was wondering maybe ccp would engage me on this topic alone if anything, and state what or even if there going to consider doing something about this, maybe a max time your ship can stay cloaked or anti cloak device, or something to make it a bit more worthwhile then having peeps drop in cloak and afk it for hours on end????added note also please dont criticise the grammer or whatever i went through it twice and got everything on the second pass, also its comments like that, that make me think that people on the boards don't give a monkey's about anyone but themselfs, or thier wallets, just goes to show that when an average joe turns up with a comment, the snotty people show up in force and disrespect him!!!!"

"when you say hours did you mean 2-3 hours or like 12-16 in the case of some people who do it down here and yes i would like to see cloaked ships detectable it would make for an interesting change tbh!!!"
"different aggression timers for different shipclasses.good idea.i support."

"i understand that this may cause extra load on the servers, but probably little more load than creating a contract with the item - which lists the contents of the container. the container can appear on the assets screen and simply be another expandable node, the contents of which are not populated until the container is selected. then the contents could be cached on the client - at least for containers in your own personal hangar, since you are the only one with access to the container and therefore the only one with the ability to change the contents."

"have a look at the average station in eve. you might notice a few hundred windows, (or huge transparent coverings in some minmatar stations). and yet, if you want to know if the station is being camped, you need to either send out a disposable alt, get a friend to come and have a look, or take your life in your hands.going through this rigmarole feels silly, breaks immersion and has no real justification. maybe an argument could be made that it prevents people from simply staying docked up, but if someone is really scared about going from black screen on undock to clone bay, they're likely to be using one of the roundabout methods of checking the undock anyway. and given the normal degree of services available, saying that the station owners won't tell you what's outside doesn't quite ring true (and that's assuming the owner of the station isn't your alliance).what i'd propose is getting your normal in-space view, centered on the station, and overview. as with normal flight, you can move the camera and look at other ships in the grid (though not target them)."
"i believe ccp has said this would be horribly laggy, but i can't find a quote to back me up on that. also, what ship are you playing with that you can't survive 30 seconds against the average station camp?"
"my arguments for this feature don't include \"i'm getting killed by station camps.\" generally, i get a warning from someone in alliance. my point is, i shouldn't need to rely on those over just being able to look outside.if lag is an issue, then maybe a simple ability to reproduce your overview in a station, seeing ships in the local area."
"posted with alt there."
"i agree. there should definitely be some way of knowing that there's a camp outside besides undocking. if lag is the only reason this isn't implemented, then perhaps have a button that's similar to the undock button, but that simply takes you to the outside view of the station (view centered on station). there would be an overview and everything, you just wouldn't be able to go anywhere because you aren't in a ship, and you also wouldn't be able to use the \"look at\" function for items on the overview. no extra lag would be caused by this that wouldn't be caused by undocking. also, people in station wouldn't cause any lag either because no functionality is being added to the normal in-station functions."
"wow, \"it would cause lag\"? how does that make any sense?the player in question isn't moving or affecting anything in the game at all... all he's doing is looking at what the server is already thinking about from the perspective of the station.and it wouldn't be something every player is doing all the time anyway. looking outside would be a service or an option while docked, and most players (read as: those not worried about station camps) would have no reason to use it.regardless, i support this idea."

"first off, i'll say to take my post with a good-sized grain of salt - i've never even seen a capital on tranquility, and the only time i've ever fooled around with them outside eft was on armageddon day. i'm getting this from eft values, from talking to some friends in 0.0, and from what i hear via forums and the grapevine in general. i'll split up my concerns by class. first up, carriers. frankly, i don't see a lot of problems with carriers. they lag systems to hell, and as such the old drone interfacing fix comes to mind(+1 drone -> +20% drone damage and hp), but aside from that they seem reasonable. they're essentially super-battleships - cost 5-10x as much, gank 50-100% harder, tank about 3x as well, and have about 10x the hp. that seems like a perfectly reasonable endgame generalist ship - cheap enough for the moderately wealthy, functional against any size of target, and hard to kill without being win buttons. the only thing that makes them brutal to fight is the fact that they use high slots for logistics, instead of needing to put weapons there, but that just leads to roles for subcapital support fleets in the form of cap warfare and jamming. aside from lag fixes, and fixes to make them less good at some of their less in-role functions(i.e., the corporate hangar nerf), leave carriers alone. motherships get a lot more intimidating, but at 30x the cost of a carrier, they're supposed to be. they are only tackleable by a limited range of ships/modules, all of which it has the firepower to burn down quickly. short of a \"screw the ammo, just ram it\" approach, or lag hell, it's pretty hard to kill a mom, and they have almost as much firepower in a capital fight as a range-fit dread to boot. but frankly, for a ship that costs north of 20 billion, this again doesn't seem unreasonable. they're hard to kill, but the loss inflicted when you do seems to balance them out enough for my tastes. dreadnoughts are where we start running into problems. not problems with the ship class itself(aside from the naglfar, which needs a boost), but problems with the whole structure of 0.0 warfare that make the ship unreasonable. put simply, as long as sovereignty rests on poses, the dreadnought class will be far more important than it ought to be, because dreads are the only ships that can take down a pos bubble in reasonable fashion. as such, an invasion of a system consists of putting together a dread fleet, running it headlong into all their poses, and waiting for their dreads to show up and try to stop you(since nothing else will be able to do the job). the result is blobby, laggy death. and because the grinds through systems are so slow, the natural disadvantages of dreads - they're slow, unwieldy, and live on a diet of pure cargo space - don't really make themselves felt, because there's more than enough time to be leisurely about applying your thousands of dps. my suspicion is that if you base sovereignty on something other than poses(like stargates), you'll actually find dreads becoming far less relevant, just because there will be so much less for them to shoot at. after all, a dread fighting battleships does less dps than a carrier at twice the cost. titans are an even bigger problem, of course, but i'm running out of characters for this post(i hate these forums...), so i'll split up my post and address titans in part 2."
"okay, titans. the biggest, baddest, most terrifying ships in the game, capable of hammering entire fleets into dust in seconds. and the most important parts of their fit are istabs and a cloak. if this isn't distilled insanity, i don't know what is - ships that could ebay for the price of a decent car, and they're fit out like baby's first iteron. the reason for this is simple, of course - their stats are currently such that the correct way of using them isn't as a command ship, or a mobile station, or anything else of that nature, but rather like a hand grenade - toss it, frag a room, and get the hell out asap. there's no conceivable incentive for a titan to actually fight, because they can only fire one weapon an hour, so they get off that shot and then get as far away from anything that could possibly tackle them as they can. and of course, if they *do* get into a fight, they don't tank any better than a carrier, and don't have any way of actually contributing except by being a magnet for enemy fire. i've seen a lot of proposed solutions to this - mostly based around killing their ability to safe up and cloak - but none of them appeal to me. a better alternative is to make it so that they don't run at all. make them ships that can stand in fleet battles and actually have a role to play, and make it so that they can't get out of dodge just by fitting up a couple of stinking istabs to dodge the tackle. the first thing that seems obvious to me is giving them a true supercapital tank, instead of one smaller than a dread has. a titan is a massive ship, and it deserves a massive tank of some variety. either give them enough cap to run an extra repper/booster, or give them a huge rep bonus(20%/level?), or even both. it should be hard as hell to kill one, and not just because they've left the field. survivability matters here - if they can't dodge a fight, and can't survive one, they become an extinct class, hoarded for their jump bridge. nobody wants that. secondly, the current timer on a doomsday is 15 seconds. this isn't nearly long enough - it promotes hit-and-run, not stand-and-fight. make it 60 - you won't see unsupported titan drops that way, i guarantee it. to avoid making the ddd obsolete, due to friendly fire, maybe make it work like a remote ecm burst - aoe at a range. it'll still blue-on-blue anything that gets in the way, but it should be easier to keep your support fleet outside its range without forcing them off-grid entirely. i'm not sure that's the right solution, but it's the best i've come up with. to prevent the fleet supporting your titan from being another four titans, make the doomsday have a sig radius, but adjust its damage to match. two million base damage at 10 km sig should keep your titans well apart from each other, while still inflicting around 80k damage base on a battleship, 30k base on a cruiser, and 10k base on a frigate, which should clean out their t1 ships real good. also, it acts as a minor mwd nerf, if you're so inclined - not especially relevant in fleet, but it can be nice. on top of that, it needs a way to stay relevant in fleet once the ddd is gone. i'm almost perverse enough to suggest letting it fit a siege module as a solution - 2x the dps of a dread, baby! - but i don't think that's quite the goal. similarly, the idea of a \"focused annihilation\" script for a ddd that deletes the cooldown is appealing, but i'm not sure it's correct. i think the easiest way of doing this would be to make the titan's gang bonus only apply to ships on-grid with it - it still can't fight for itself, but it can do a number on you with its buddies. also, it makes it a lot easier to fix the ragnarok's currently-lame bonus - have it be -10% or even -15% sig per level, and the gjallarhorn have the biggest aoe of the ddd's, so that your fleet gets a free -50% or -75% doomsday damage. there's more i might say later, but that's all i have to add on combat. damn, i'm verbose. also, here's a thumb for you."
"while i understand that ccp feels that capitals are pushing out sub capitals, look at what most modern navies are like.the usa navy, for example, has 0 battleships, and several aircraft carriers. why? most commanders realize the usefulness of a multi-functional ship, like a carrier, and the inherent limitations of battleships and their kin, dreadnoughts. in real life, as in eve, the only real use for bss is to blow up other bss. however, bss are easy targeted by bombers.so here's my suggestion: first, introduce bombers, they're about the same size as a fighter, but move much slower, but do a great deal of damage, when they drop their 'bombs'. second: reduce the hps of fighters to a very low level and increase their spread, while reducing their damage; the role of a bomber should be anti-ship, the role of a fighter should be anti-fighter/interceptor/bomber. the idea is to force the carrier pilot to have to pick what he or she will fill his or her drone bay with, and what he or she should launch. they'll have to use bombers if they want to deal any real damage to ships like bses, but will need to escort their bombers to-and-from their targets, unless they want them to be shot down. on titans:i think titans really, really need to be defined better then \"fathers of the fleet\" i mean, wtf is that suppose to mean? does it have hot space sex with motherships who give birth to thousands of little frigates who grow into more titans and moms? i'd really, really like to see ccp revisit this ship and a, give it a more defined role, and b, make sure it works in that role, and c, no nerfs, or at least nothing game changing like removing the ddd.now, from my understanding, titans are basically suppose to be most useful to alliances, but, this isn't really helpful. now, if we look at titans as if they're suppose to be mobile stations, then we need to introduce station related bonuses, like the ability to research bpos and build items like ammo. if it is suppose to be a mobile station, then the ddd should only be usable as a defensive measure, and only when the titan is 'deployed' to station mode. anyways...*insert wall of text here*"
"well, if you insist. okay, more titans. non-combat titans this time, though. titans are, in addition to their role as pimped-out rides for the fc, are supposed to act as mobile stations. as it stands, they just don't. yes, they have a clone bay and a small hangar, and yes it has some uses, but an outpost it's not. so, in the spirit of the clone vat bay i, here's some potential modules for titan highslots. all of them are 100,000 grid and 100 cpu, just to make the numbers easy. also, none of them should require the ship to stop moving - the labs and factories can't really handle it. and before i continue, yes, i acknowledge my likely insanity. mobile refinery iallows refining of items in the corporate hangar and cargo bay. 0% base efficiency. requires mobile refinery operation i (edit skill to add 5% per level efficiency)accelerated mobile factory iadds one factory slot usable by the titan pilot or a player docked in the maintenance bay. works at 500% speed, adds 100% wastage. requires mobile factory operation i (edit skill to reduce wastage by 10% per level)efficient mobile factory iadds ten factory slots usable by the titan pilot or a player docked in the maintenance bay. adds 100% wastage. requires mobile factory operation i (edit skill to reduce wastage by 10% per level)mobile laboratory iadds one research slot of each type usable by the titan pilot or a player docked in the maintenance bay. -50% research speed. requires mobile laboratory operations i (reduces penalty by 5% per level)there are few enough titan pilots that the existing stockpoles of mfo and mro might be sufficient, but failing that, seed them on market at a couple billion, so none of the investors lose money. and of course, mlo will be the same price(and will require science v and laboratory operation v). and, last but not least...mobile cynosural jammer iprevents the opening of non-covert cynosural fields in system. displays on overview for all pilots in system(as a cynosural field). requires propulsion jamming v, anchoring vwell, if they're going to be a mobile station, why not? *ducks flamethrower*"
"supported in general. i'd love to see titans changed to actually be involved in fighting and not just hit and runs."
"i don't, i repeat, don't want to see these as modules, they should be inherent ablities native to titans and other ships, except for the mobile cynosural jammer"
"not the response i was expecting, admittedly. the reason i went for modules is that it both allows for customization and it gives titans something to do with all those useless high slots they have besides throw on random warfare links and smartbombs. it's not like they actually use guns, after all. making them inherent could work too. the biggest problem with the module-based version is that titans go offline during downtime, and this does solve that. however, it still seems wrong to me somehow - maybe it's the idea of people sitting inside researching blueprints as the ship is jump bridging in an assault fleet, but that seems a little *too* generalist."
"meh."
"the bounty hunting system is weak. bounty hunters in eve don't exist, but they really, really should. this is one way to help do it."
"i support this idea. killrights should be tradable,"
"i have been wondering about this topic for some time. traditionally, bounty hunters are paid to do their job. how will it be possible to have a bounty hunting system where the bounty hunter has to pay the victim for the right to shoot the criminal? if the bounty hunters only income is the criminals' bounties and gear, how will any self-respecting bounty hunter be able to support themselves? most of the guys with bounties on them are already -5 or lower, and looting pvp gear does not support a pvp lifestyle.i would be grateful if anyone could clear up my confusion."
"anything that allows for more pvp is fine by me."
"i've just looked at all the numbers to see if you have a point, and i'm not sure that you do. blasters do the highest dps at the shortest range, with middling tracking and fitting requirements. pulse lasers have the longest range, middle dps, but terrible tracking and fitting requirements. autocannons track a bit better than blasters, are a bit easier to fit, but do the lowest dps of the group. the easiest comparison is between the unnamed t1 biggest gun of each class(neutron, mega, and 800). they've all got the same rof, which makes them a lot easier to compare directly. the damage mods are 3.5, 3, and 2.695, meaning that the autocannon does 77% of the damage of a blaster. it's got 2 km less optimal and 6 km more falloff, meaning only a marginal increase in range. it tracks marginally worse. it uses 250 less grid and 16 less cpu, which is actually significant, as well as using no capacitor, which is nice(especially when facing cap warfare). but these aren't worth giving up a quarter of your dps for, as a rule. in fact, a maelstrom fitting 800mm's versus neutrons will get *less* damage from the autocannons using t1 ammo, and only about 3% more with t2 ammo(with all-v skills and 8x t2 guns, it gets 450 dps with antimatter, 423 with emp, 539 with hail, and 525 with void). this is a ship with a projectile bonus, and the hybrid is still doing almost identical damage. the pulse laser comparison is less direct, since the numbers don't line up nearly so well. the autocannon does 90% of the dps, tracks 28% better, has significantly less range(4+16 km vs 20+8), and takes 500 grid and 11 cpu less. there's no minmatar ship that does better with pulses than autocannons. and of course, pulse lasers are pigs for capacitor(5.3 cap/s per gun with multi, fully skilled), whereas autocannons use none. all that said, there's also the fact that the races are optimized a bit differently. blasters are supposed to be the best short-ranged weapon type - no ship can do dps as well as a gallentean blaster boat, especially once you factor in the plus-sized drone bays. and that's intentional, and highly unlikely to change - it's part of racial balance, not just balance between different weapon types. blasters do ludicrous dps, but they have infinitesimal range, take cap, and can't change damage type. pulses have good range and middling damage, but they take a lot of cap, can't change damage type(generally doing the worst type, at that), and aren't as good close-in due to their lack of tracking. tl;dr = autocannons do crappy dps, but they aren't as bad as they look. the rest of the difference can be chalked up to the fact that they're supposed to be bad. bane, i see where you're coming from here, but i'm afraid i can't agree. when they knock 25% off the speed of minmatar ships, they can feel free to add 25% to their autocannon dps. until then, i'll let racial balancing take its natural course."
"willing to give a thumbs up on the conditional that an explanation is given as to cap usage - blasters/pulses do more dps, but also use cap. i agree minnie bs need some help, but at the same time i wouldn't want ccp to create a close range monster where autos suddenly have huge dps with no drawbacks."
"the issue is neither minmatar bs nor is it large autocannons. two of the minmatar bs are perfectly fine in their current iterations when using autocannons[the maelstrom and typhoon].booting those will give an unnecessary boost to both those two ships which need nothing as well as may impact the balance of other ships(as autocannons are the near universal choice of supplementary/unbonused turret)the problem is only in the tempest and only due to the tempest not being properly engineered to deal with the inherent problems of low optimal high falloff weapns. that is, large autocannons are to be used within a tight optimal window, and are fit on a ship class which is heavy and cumbersome, this makes it take more time for the ship to achieve that tight window which reduces its effectiveness. boosting the weapons directly changes the racial characteristics towards a more homogeneous form, changing the ships to be less heavy and cumbersome pushes out smaller ships as the larger one hedges out the \"agility and speed\" niche filled by smaller ones.you should not bring this issue to ccp."
"hey, hey goumidong. shut it. we know you wouldn't like this change as it's not buffing your precious amarr."
"actually i find large autocannons to perform perfectly fine. them not needing cap is a real bonus in close quarters, which nicely offsets the somewhat weaker dps. not to mention them stretching out nicely into medium range.otoh large (and medium) arties need help badly, as them not using cap is relatively inconsequential, but their dps is teh suck and their 'variable damage type' advantage is something of a joke too."
"his suggested fix was buffing the tempest to be quicker and more agile. how are you interpreting that as mindless amarrian partisanship?"
"464 dps with t2 ammo on a ship with double dps bonus and a gyrostab isnt fun :("
"gouming, you've gotten better over the past few weeks but you're still no where close to bane. shut up and get out."
"i support the opacs should get some more damage \o/"
"actually its 100 cube bandwidth, 300 cube bay that i am more pushing for. the phoon and maelstrom have been engineered properly and are fine ships when using ac's. one of these will use only acs in its high slots. so clearly there isn't a problem with the weapons.and if there is it means you have to nerf the phoon and the maelstrom in your quest to boost the tempest. its a lot easier to just boost the tempest."
"phoon gets only ~200 dps from acs. doesnt look like a minnie ship to me."
"the typhoon has more unique weapon systems than any other ship in the game - it uses guns, missiles, and drones as primary sources of damage. only the naglfar even comes close to that status, and even then the drones are a lot less relevant. as such, it's probably the worst battleship in the game, since it's the only one whose bonuses help it so little. but my typhoon hatred aside, it's not supposed to do obscene ac damage, since it also gets 300 dps from drones and 300 dps from torpedoes. 200 ac dps is hardly the problem."
"so what do you see the role of a battleship being if you think its acceptable to do crappy dps?its also a myth that minmatar bs (that rely on ac's) have a speed/agility advantage. the tempest is barely any quicker than a hyperion with the same mass and agility. maelstrom is heavy and slow and nothing like a minmatar bs. typhoon doesn't need ac's, it relys on torps and drones.chalked up they're supposed to be bad?!?! wtf, nothing in eve is meant to be bad or there's no point using it! they're meant to perform equally through different methods and quite simply they don't.its more than ac's, its the ammo's. we're a long way from when emp was a great ammo with active hardeners being the only real way to tank. nevermind hail that makes ac's have less range than blasters.of course the end performance is important so relys on the ship hull a lot:maelstrom is totally not minmatar in style and limited to active tanking. hides ac damage as it can fit 3 gyros.tempest relys a lot on base damage due to slot layout meaning limited damage modules and for a ship woth rof and dmg bonus its rubbish. same mass and agility as hyperion/megathron and barely anymore speed.typhoon relys on torps and drones and only has one bonus effectively as 1st bonus for 4 weapons and 2nd bonus for 4 weapons where other ships have 1 bonus for 8 weapons. at least it has minmatar speed, mass and sig even though the nanophoon days are long gone except for bumping.tl;dr: tweak ac's themselves a bit (such as falloff and falloff per tier).fix ammo's that no longer have the benifit they were given lower damage for and hail that sucks with optimal and falloff penalty."
"\"we can ignore the quality of autocannons on the maelstrom because it it is slow and sluggish\"man what?"
"i approve this message!"
"this side of eve could really do with some new content and improvements."
"the eve economy is just not realistic because there is no product differentiation aside point of sale and pricebut allowing people to make their own custom modules and ships is a can of worms, not least because it has the potential to cause an explosion in the number of items in the items dbthus i think your list is good, but isn't going to fix the fundamental problem"
"i have no experience with the industry side of eve. that said, anything that will make their lives easier sounds good to me; it can only lead to lower prices. (o:"
"supported."
"every gtc that is sold for isk is perminantly appied to a players account. sure, i don't like the fact that people with rl money can take advantage of the game but, all that rl money is going to ccp to maintain and develope the game."
"no but as there is always in- and outflux of people demand will never dissipate so you are wrong, sorry."
"wrong.an isk sink must, by definition, require a regular flow of isk out of the game. most people who can afford very expensive implants are going to plug them into worthwhile characters, and such characters will likely be sold to someone (or given to a friend) if they leave the game.very few players are going to terminate an account with characters on it that are so valuable.no isk sink. you're wrong."
"permanently applied to a player's account? huh? isk moves from character to character, account to account. many rich players exist in eve through gtc sales, and not hard work. plenty of folks buy expensive implants and expensive ship with gtc money, and not hard work."
"newer players should be given an opportunity if they want to work hard to earn a fastr sp/hour !"

"as a falcon pilot i don't think they're imbalanced. when i'm not in mine, and my gang comes across one or two, we figure out a way to deal with them. sometimes we don't have a good solution but usually we do. if it's a roaming gang, you send one fast ship at it to go harass it, and that poor falcon can't fight back at all. it just sits there being scared, and will warp out or succumb to fofs or drones. it's not like it has any dps worth mentioning.that said, i also would not consider a small reduction in the falcon's range to be out of the question."
"there are loads of counters to falcons, and ecm boats in general. range and ecm is their only real tank.if your \"small gang\" only consists of slow, short range, high damage ships. then long range ecm is the perfect counter and you wonder why it seems overpowered?yes a falcon the biggest threat to a small gang. this doesn't mean it should be nerfed."
"i think id rather try and explain the problem one more time instead of commenting on each of the replies. it seems to me that people don't understand the situation and therefore don't see the need for the change.lets take a theoretical example of a 3 vs 3 on a gate in low sec. all of them flying battleships, outlaws, t2 fits and with max skills. the outcome of the fight is now decided by tactic and fitting of the 2 gangs.lets add one force recon to one of the sides and see how they can influence the fight.rapier:40km web range and 63km paint range. it can effectively stop a spider tank if it webs the bs when they de-cloak at gate. it has to stay within range all of the bs to be effective. even if it stay at max range it can be attacked by missiles, drones and ew.pilgrim12.5km nos/neut and 101km tracking disruption. if it stays out at 100km range and disrupts turret ships it is still possible to counter with missiles and sentry drones. arazu48km warp disruption and 63km remote sensor dampener. can dampen 1 ship down to 12-14km target range. if it dampens all ships down they can still fight the other bs. if it try to take out one bs the other bs can still attack the arazu.falcon228km ecm range. can jamm multiple bs, probably all of them unless they have 2x eccm fitted. none of the bs is able to target the falcon when they are not jammed. the falcon will effectively prohibit a spider tank. the bs can not attack the falcon.when setup for max range there is no way of countering the falcon in the above scenario, while the 3 other force recons is possible to attack/counter. the only viable counter to a long range falcon in low sec is nano ships.- - -long range jamming was previously the domain of the rook. to successfully fly a long range rook you would actually have to pilot it. lots of tactics could be applied against a rook (mostly before the fight), but most important even if it could stay out of range the other side had the chance to scout it out first. to discover a long range jammer before the actual fight is extremely important, since it is out of range during the fight. it is not possible to scout a cloaked falcon.the falcon is now the new long range jammer, it has taken the place of the rook (which is now obsolete). it requires little to none skill to fly a falcon this way. you can just park a cloaked falcon alt out at 200km and use it when needed. there is no other ship that requires so little personal skill to fly and has such a huge impact on pvp. i don't understand why the falcon is considered broken if it cannot perform, and do exactly the same, as a rook.there could be many ways to fix the falcon. give it more low slots, give it a drone bay, give it a ecm drone bonus, give it anything. but it should, like with the rest of the force recons, require some personal skill to successfully use a falcon in pvp. now its just decloak  jamm  cloak, preferably with an falcon-alt.200km range, tripple ecm-bonus and cov ops cloak is 3 powerful attributes. combine them all on one ship and it becomes overpowered.edit: spelling"
"wow this thread is full of garbage (not from the op, he is correct).the biggest problem is that the most effective counter to a falcon is to bring another falcon of your own. here are some of the \"counters\" proposed so far:1. fit eccm. guess what, 1x eccm on a battleship will make a good skilled falcon with racials have a one in three chance of a jam per jammer. i'm sorry but sacrificing a med slot to make you resistant to jamming should do a whole hell of alot more than taking your chance of getting jammed from 1 in 2 to 1 in 3. honestly, i think eccm should give around a 200% bonus, taking a 22 sensor strength battleship to around 66. jammers still have a chance of working agianst that, just like they have a chance agianst carriers now, but at least a falcon won't still cripple your gang even when you fit to counter it.2. bring a sniper. ok, so you bring a sniper apoc. assuming that the falcon doesn't jam it, then the sniper will hit with one salvo and the falcon will warp off. at this point the falcon is free to warp back in and try to jam the apoc agian. but meanwhile your gang is left with a sniper while the enemy gang is left with a cloaked falcon. if your sniper warped in at zero and is right in the thick of the fight, the enemy gang can melt him almost instantly then the falcon is free to decloak and jam with impunity. if your sniper came at range, then the falcon can come back in at range from an opposite direction and be out of the sniper's range. of course there is nothing to stop the sniper from trying to chase the falcon around, but the falcon is a cloaker and it warps quite a bit faster than a slow battleship will. 3. burn to the falcon with a tackler. ok, so you send an inty or a hac to the falcon and try to lock him down and kill him. one racial jammer is good enough to absolutely permajam (as in jam str > sensor str) anything up to a hac, and in some cases a command ship. something like an ishtar might be able to make the falcon warp out and back in to get the drones off, but thats about it. to really kill a falcon you are looking at a couple nano recon ships minimum, preferably with eccm fit. i personaly have only lost my falcon once, to a huginn and vaga that burned to me. even then if i wasn't running the falcon as an alt while i concentrated on my main in a battleship, i would have warped out if they started to get near scram range and i didn't have jams on them yet. i am hardly a perfect falcon pilot, i know a better, undistracted falcon pilot would have easily escaped that situation. now, for the real falcon counter:5. bring your own falcon. if you bring your own falcon, then you have a chance to jam him first and then jam the rest of the enemies with impunity. if the falcon jams you either warp back in and try agian, or pick a spot out of his range. at the worst you force a break-even situation where you both are able to jam the damage dealers and the fight is ballanced. in fact an even better tactic would be to bring two or three falcons and jam three times as many targets. if you have three falcons and the enemy doesn't, target is the only word to properly describe their ships."
"i completely agree with the op. we can't have a one-trick-pony that actually does that one trick well, can we?in addition it is against caldari design principles to have a ship that is actually useful."
"this issue is difficult to describe and can have many meanings, but overall it is characterized by a marginalization of subfleet ships when considered alongside battleships.the discussion at the csm would be an exhaustive analysis and discussion of battleships' effects on the game, what the problems are (if any), and possible approaches to alleviating the problems. concrete solutions might not be included, but if the overall result is an expansion of ccp's perspective on battleship overproliferation, then progress has been made.this would include discussion of: * battleship overabundance * t2/rig - only the super-rich can afford to regularly fly and lose fleet ships (see: divide and stratification) * \"sniper fleets\" and what can be done about them * the divide between veterans and new players * the stratification between powergamers and more casual players * effects on eve warfare * revisiting new anti-fleet features and ships, such as the titan [*]imbalances within battleship classes themselves (e.g. underpowered minmatar fleet ships)even if you don't think that anything should be changed at all,the bottom line here is this: ccp has stated that they feel that battleships are crowding out sub-fleetships and something has to be done. ccp changing something with battleships is inevitable, and it is in everyone's best interest to use the opportunity presented by the csm to discuss this issue with the developers.neglecting to bring this up at the csm would be a huge waste of an opportunity. i have a notion that the csm was created with this issue specifically in mind, among a few other topics.show your support if you feel compelled to do so."
"i see what you did there.wasn't funny, though."
"i just see a lot of words here and little meaning to them tbh"
"sums up this thread nicely."
"i agree, if they put the voting/support aspect in an ideas/issues forum that would be awesome, but the csm serves no unique purpose just a few redundant onesedit:i find it funny that if this thread gets the 5% support it needs the csm will bring it up and then not escalate it to ccp, the system works"
"i do not agree to this proposal.the csm had barely time to get started and because we do not see immidiate results the first call for stopping the csm. i think it will take at the very least 6 month before we can really assess what good or bad the csm did. besides this first csm has a harder time then any other who will follow in their steps. becaue they have to create the rules and procedures from scratch. a lot of people have never learned to argue, or to respond to a rational argument. perhaps the fault is not in the csm but in the persons who call everyone who disagree a whiner and react angrily if they cannot get their way."
"hardly anybody is interested in the csm. just look at how many thumbs up the most popular topics get.topics get nowhere near enough votes to warrant things being an issue as per ccp rules.csm was supposed to be voice of the players. it isn't."
"agreed."
"currently torps and hams have very little use. while they do more damage than their guided missile counterparts, their fitting and other disadvantages are too great.my suggestion:put fitting costs and abilities more in line with other close range weapons.decrease fitting costs as seen fitmake them behave more like up-sized rockets, short range (current ranges are probably appropriate)/high velocity/high explosion velocity/lower explosion radius (at least on torps)damage and rof should be adjusted as appropriate"
"i find hams quite useful. am and torps i find useless in the extreme."
"ya hams can be a bit tough to fit, but torps? do you not have engineering v and advanced weapon upgrades iv?"
"torp raven's are scary. do you pvp?"
"let stealth bombers fit torps, pleeeeeeeease!"
"don't lump torps in with hams, they're separate systems and i can't support bringing both up. hams need help, torps are fine."
"seen a lot of ham-based insanity. they're fine as-is, it just takes a little more creativity to use them well. and creativity is not a bad thing."
"torps, hams, and rockets are the blasters et al. of the missile world. their damage, range, rof, and fitting requirements are all in line with the other short range-high damage weapons as is.pve != pvp"
"<3 torp phoon"
"i agree ham's needs a bit of love"
"hams maybe need a slight bit of loving. but slight, and mostly in the pg department so caldari can fit them easier. that said, i love hams as they are now and use them as aux. dps on my hurricanes. they're awesome weapon systems.torps are awesome.rockets need major loving, the damage output is extremely underwhelming for a short range weapon system, up to the point where unbonused acs (which are lowest dps of them all) do more damage then bonused rockets."
"i use both a lot and find them to be perfectly fine weapon systems. then again i don't use hams on caldari ships, so maybe they do have too high pg reqs for those. but torps definitely don't need another boost."
"swap the powergrid usage on heavy missiles and hams so they follow the tradition of longer range weapons taking up more powergrid? that would make hams far more viable on ships like the caracal and the cerb.but torps are just fine.."
"bearing in mind that...\"the strongest argument against democracy is a five minute discussion with the average voter\"can we have some confirmation from ccp that the csm is not going to be a carte blanche for populist measures that may serve some peoples self-interest, but ultimately damage the game that i enjoy."
"all the csm has the right to do is forward suggestions and ask for information - it's not like ccp just gave 9 randoms access to the source code. if ccp thinks a given suggestion is bad for the game, they just won't implement it. i don't have a single quick quote handy, but this was made pretty clear in the csm founding documents."
"the csm is a soapbox. this game has a history of caving in to whining and therefore giving people a more effective medium to whine can be destabilising as they will feel that their ideas have some more legitimacy.the most popular decision is not always the right one."
"yes, occasionally(though not often enough, imo), i think you care way too much about the mindset of whiners, and it's also not always the wrong one."
"if your country held a referendum tomorrow and the question was 'do you want to halve income tax' what response would you get?i trust ccp to run this game they have for 5 years...why do we need a say now?"
"frankly, i think such a referendum would fail - we canadians like our taxes far too much(or, at least, we're way too stoic about \"well, it's going to a good cause...\"). as for why we need a say, why don't you ask ccp that? they did this of their own accord. maybe it's marketing the game. maybe it's an attempt to create an actual process for dealing with whine threads instead of ad-hoc dev responses. maybe it's because they want to broaden the whine thread process a bunch, so you actually get people on both sides of the debate instead of just the usual \"/signed\", and thereby get a better feel for what the players really think. maybe they realize that the player base has a lot of good ideas, if you can just filter out the crap, and as such they want to set up a system to take advantage of those ideas. or maybe they just think it'll be funny to watch. who knows? the point is, it's here, and i'd like to see it succeed a lot more than i'd like to see it implode."
"from this thread dated 5/17/07 but nothing since."
"eula, section 7(conduct), paragraph a(specifically restricted conduct), line 2 - you may not use your own or third-party software to modify any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is played.ffs, ccp, why did you put this in the eula if you were just going to allow people to take advantage of the game in that way.i'm calling for those that use any and all third party programs to be banned within 1 month following an in game warning."
"i am not familiar with any third party programs that \"modif[ies] any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is played.\""
"it's not just an issue of what you want, but it's an issue of what can be reasonably enforced.their stance on this issue has always been very reasonable."
"this pops up all the time. any third party application that gives the player additional info, or allows him to command himself or his fleet more efficiently is breaking this part of the eula.any programs that give the player additional tools that give him an advantage over players without it are the epitome of this rule, and players use them all the time and think nothing of it.i agree that something needs to be done. ccp needs to either revise the eula, or start enforcing the rules."
"i'm firmly in the \"revise the eula\" camp. any eula that says evemon, eft, and an eve maps book are banned is a eula that needs a total reworking."
"needs more support!"

"so mining exploiters (jetcan mining) get extra aggro rules to deal with theft , but highsec pirates playing on gang mechanics get smacked down ?it is only fair that the war target warning works in any circumstances , but removing this mechanic altogether is another gift to pure carebears.i'm curious to see how command ship alts will affect highsec wars , too."
"this issue will get no traction, nor should it. look at the big picture here. ccp is not doing this out of any particular love for carebears or hate for high sec pirates. they are doing it because they realize that faction warfare will be a total flop if people can't trust each other in forming fleets. realistically, between preserving a specific type of scam and promoting a huge and greatly anticipated feature like faction warfare, which do you think is going to take priority? in the dying words of mr. spock, \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\""

"no.making isk from getting ganked is just....wrong.what is stopping me from making an alt and sending him through losec on autopilot for a week collecting killrights.i'm 100% for tradable kill rights but this is not the answer."
"i agree, but i don't think this would happen under this system. it'd have to be a kill contract - the bounty hunter isn't going to pay for the right to shoot someone, and the contractor isn't going to pay someone to take the kill right away with nothing to show for it, so a contract is the natural middle ground. bounty hunter takes contract, acquires kill rights, kills, gets paid. there's no other stable setup."
"reposted response from the other whiny thread on this issue:you get benefits from declaring the war and those benefits give you certain privileges in secured space.congratulations! you have just paid concord war fees! here is what you get:1. the right to blow up war targets- in secured space2. the right to pod war targets- in secured space3. the right commit the above without interference from concord or sentry fire- in secured space4. the right to commit the above without loss of security status - in secured spacehere is what you do not get:1. the right to freely harm neutrals- in secured space2. the right to use aoe weapons without consequence- in secured space3. the right to worry free and unobstructed looting and salvaging of war target's wrecks - in secured spaceif you do not like these restrictions we are sorry. concord suggest you have a dedicated looter, get a faster ship, or get your a** out of high sec to fight your war.concord thanks you!patri"
"factor this in while deciding then:you have fought another ship and beaten it. the aftermath of the fight is that the defeated ship was converted into a wreck, which might contain loot and salvage worth several million isk. the current mechanics allow someone to swoop in and run off with all of that. you are not allowed to stop that from happening (in empire) without becoming criminally flagged. a game mechanic that allows someone to run off with millions of isk worth of items that belong to someone else, with the full protection of concord (highsec) or sentry guns (lowsec), does not belong in what is supposed to be a pvp game. it is the worst sort of carebearism. you've got mission runners agreeing with pirates agreeing with pvpers on this issue. the only people disagreeing are the carebears who don't want to be shot at while they take what doesn't belong to them."
"hey guys, after looking at it, and comparing it with the naglfar and her abilitiesi was wondering, would it be appropriate to introduce a 5th high slot to the phoenix (caldari dreadnought)to enable the use of the turret?the ship looks weird without a railgun on the platforms.and i really don't understand why the phoenix has the ability to fit a railgun, and not give it any sort of boost to make it a ethical decision to place a railgun on the shipso why does the naglfar get 2 turrets and 2 missiles with a siege module and the phoenix only get 4 high slots to support only a 3rd of the weapons with the siege module..what is so great about it now that it doesn't allow the turret? /me makes petition to get the phoenix a 5th high slot to use the 4th weapon with a siege module =d"
"looking at the pheonix i see no reason why it has that turret hard-point at all, but buffing the pheonix would unfortunately put it out of balance with all other dreads so all dread would have to be buffed. i think going on the pheonix's awesome dpv (about 80k with kinetic torps) the rail gun is completely useless.also the naglfail is horrible to train for due to the dual weapons the pheonix is good as it is atm and imo the dreads are pretty well balanced./me is no eft warrior"
"solution: remove turret hardpoint from phoenix."

"i'll explain my view a moment if i may ...the members of the csm will *definitely* have their own views on the topics brought to us and will certainly discuss them to and fro with our own thoughts but at *this* time we are saying that a particular topic is worth getting a discussion with ccp about whether we personally think it is good or bad. iz"
"this one. there is no reasonable way for the community to give input to the csm on the threads for them to make their decision until after they have been announced as on the agenda. if you do not have said reason then you will only have the supporters, making the discussion not a discussion, but, as previously said, a rally. or could the my post on the 29th be a record for when this topic came up for discussion so that the csm could vote on it if they so wanted?[by your argument, they can, by your argument they can vote on anything that has been posted to the forums ever]i mean hell, the csm didn't record a single nay vote regarding any of the topics(or if they did, it was a strikingly low number), the csm didn't even have an idea of what half of the suggestions were trying to say or what they ought to be, as evidenced by the minutes where they had to agree to discuss it at a later date.no, it does not give any power to the csm since it only allows players to give the csm more information. this venue is soft power on the part of the players over the csm. which by definition reduces their power.it means one thread is for people to support an issue and one thread is for people to discuss an issue. it means there is the required discussion and it means there is the venue for which the 5% support can be reached._________________________________________________what is this template and why has it not been posted anywhere for the public to review?"
"the csm is not here to discuss the issues the csm is here to bring the issues to ccp. if the csm were to discuss each issue at the meetings they would never get anything done. you couldn't argue the merits and problems of two of the issues in the entire time the csm had to get through its meetings.the forums are where the discussion is supposed to happen and that is why it is so important that we actually have a venue to discuss these things instead the **** that we have now. that is why its so important that we have discussion threads on what the csm is going to be voting on.there is a clear timeline: issue(forum) -> discussion/formulation(forum) -> csm vote(meeting) -> ccp meetings and response(assuming yes vote)/csm rep summary explanation(assuming no vote)implementing this is really really easy, requires no changing of the csm documents, no vote or anything. all that needs to be done is for a csm to make a thread after an issue has been on placed on the agenda[or when it meets the requirements to be voted on] and keep that thread open for 7 days(preferably in here rather than in the assembly hall since since there is not signed mechanism here) before voting on whether or not to bring it to ccp and in what form its going to be in. [note, the csm document requires no end date, only a minimum of 7 days]its that easy."
"it would be nice to somehow flag threads that meet the requirements for csm discussion (one representative support or 5% support) on the discussion thread. i am of the opinion that if a representative is going to support an issue to be taken to the csm meeting, then that representative should state this clearly in the thread before the 7 day discussion period is up (and possibly within the first 2 days or so).an interesting selection of topics brought up for the 2nd meeting- however, don't treat us like idiots- there was no way that some of those topics had popular general support! it also looks like the csm is going to become a technical development branch by the look of some of those topics..take care,arithron"
"an interesting point brought up in that post; however, don't treat us like idiots- there is no way that the topics couldn't have had general support!it also looks like the csm is going to be a council which represents the playerbase by the looks of some of those topics.."
"just throwing another idea at the table. make the \"focused script\" anti-capital weapon thingy actually damaging significantly the titan firing it himself (as if the focused dd energy is too much for the ship to handle). the dmg would have to be percentage-wise, e.x. 20% of remaining hp, so multiple hits will not render the titan useless and a 2% reduction to that dmg from a new high rank titan-only skill. but give it great alpha, as in popping carriers (at least) in one hit, ecm effect to the ship being hit and energy neutralizing on top. this may bring tactical options up, as in fleet logistics for the titan that will need to be repaired, energy transfered, protected e.t.c. p.s. or i may just talk crap all along :p"
"impossible is something quiter says. csm document doesn't say it can't be amended.there also no reason why you can't have more then one meeting a week. you can have the normal meeting and then a approvel of the minutes meeting 2 days later.either way, saying it's impossible thus why your way is the only way seems very weak to me.edit-great slander here.now, i can't speak for darius. nor will i dare to even try.i'll merely point out the committees we have in my government, were made during a offical meeting. you can argue that unoffical meetings can create a lot of problems and group think. which i think we need to avoid since there are many different type of people in eve.all the csm need to work together to make this more efficiency but not sacrifice what they believe/think is right. it will never be perfect, cause when people disagree there will always be a lot of going back and forth till there is a vote. i will say this, to me it seem like jade was pulling a fast one. the motion wasn't clear and it changes the csm document.the very same csm document that crazynamecsmperson says makes it impossible to approve the minutes the next meeting. but whatever, csm first meeting is shady already. no surpise to me."
"you're being horribly unfair here - they found a solution. a functional one, at that. it's not the default one used in most councils, but it suits their needs just fine. and if chat logs go up as soon as the meeting ends, then the minutes are next to irrelevant anyways. it's fine, leave it alone."
"a solution that changes the csm document that csmcrazyname says they can't approve the minutes next meeting due to the very same csm document. it's not fine cause the logic behind the change is wrong. csm document says minutes must be out 3days after the meeting.thus change csm document to allow chair to sign off on the minutes.they acted like this was the only solution and darius was made the bad guy cause he wanted all the members to voted on it. i remember countless times of our minutes being mess up, while logs are good it's quite clear there were problems with communcation in that meeting.they are setting up the ground work for future csm. i think there are good reasons why most bodies that produce minutes have the voting members approve them, thus allowing them a chance to correct minutes or misunderstanding.clerks make mistakes, if you look at the motion they were making. it was very unclear, yet jade was trying to push a vote and probably didn't even know the question themselves since they had crazycsmname person say it.i do think it's interesting i'm unfair for speaking my opinion and pointing out this is how majority of the world does it. the logic is wrong and i'm more then free to point it out."
"letting the chair sign off on the minutes is hardly a change to the csm document. it's a stopgap that was approved by the council, and as such meets most rules of order i've ever seen. and darius's objection sure didn't seem to me to be about the lack of a vote - the vote was being called, and that was his objection. he wanted more time, not more democracy. he also objected to the chair having power somebody else didn't, of course, but that explains what his vote was, not so much the debate around the voting. as for what they should do in future, i'd agree that they should seek a change to the structure of the minutes to allow them to be approved at the subsequent meeting, as most other organizations do, and use the chatlogs to fill the three-day rule. it seems almost backwards to have the more detailed version come out first, but it's probably the right solution. the unfair part was \"impossible is something quiter says\" - something is against their constitution, thus they don't do it. that's not quitting, that's the rule of law, and attacking them for it is stupid - and, yes, unfair. also, it's way easier to type \"ank\" or \"ankh\" than \"csmcrazyname\". when it's too long or unpronounceable, just abbreviate it"

"currently the only way i've found that i can play one eve across 2 monitors is to use a spanned desktop which then gives the options for a really wide eve window in the escape menu. in theory it's cool but in practice it's kind of crappy and you have to play in windowed mode (which i do anyway so i can have a client on each monitor). the spanned desktop also does bad things to other stuff i want to do on my computer like watching a movie in fullscreen mode makes it chop in half. when streaching an eve window across both you actually have to make it quite a bit smaller than the full multiscreen size too or your speed dial and centered messages get brutalized and hard to comprehend during time critical situations. as the game technically has dual monitor 'work arounds' but no true support i definately give this a thumbs up. some things needed are:-multi monitor fullscreen suport-not having to use desktop span as a workaround because of its negative effects on other computer uses-the ability to unlock and move the speed dial section to be fully on one monitor so it doesn't get ruined-a checkbox in multiscreen mode that causes centered popups and messages to be fully on one screen or the other"

"one common abuse this game does suffers from is the acquisition of skill & research points (\"resources\") from accounts that do not pay to play. we would all be against some sort of daily isk stipend given to all players why are we okay with this situation.did i leave eve at one point in the past? yes.did i set a battleship v to train while i was gone? yes.of course in equal measure i was gone for 4 months and no i did not reactivate and start new training and deactivate. i have never made secondary accounts that farm the game from an inactive state. in fact, i only have two accounts (since 2003) and i only have two mains who do some research. mind you i don't think others should play the game my way but i do think that if others want to compete with me they should be required to actually play the game. and the gain of resources is competing with myself and everyone else. stop the injustice, stop the abuse. account expires, suspend all resource gain.now, i think that allowing expired accounts to gain anything may be more \"marketing\" than it is game balance. knowing that your account will have that super long skill trained and a crapload of datacores to sell if, or when, you decide to come back is likely a strong inducement for people to return to eve.(wow, typed that last paragraph and i realized i've got nowhere to go from here.)"
"i guess i sort of agree about research points, but i don't think there's a problem with allowing one skill to finish when an account is inactive. overall, i don't think it's worth bringing up."
"well i think having a range of issues, both large and small, gives the csm, the first csm, the chance to reap rewards that take little work, and would make it into game faster, while everyone waits for the bigger ideas to be implemented.and two things i'd add here, if i remember rightly this is something implemented on eve-china. when eve-everyone else heard of it the screams of worry and outrage were rather pronounced. now, a good bit later it may be a good time to revisit the idea since, at least in the market forum, we've seen major economic vehicles fully built out of maximizing expired account resource gain. i think it would be hypocritical to put a stop to one form of free resource gain and not another.secondly, i also realize that this idea is not going to be popular. after all, how many people you know sometimes say, \"bah, i'm going elsewhere for a month and i'll just let [insert_long_skill] train while i pay a ccp competitor instead.\""
"i disagree with this.if you want to \"compete\" with expired accounts in the research points field, you can simply do the research agent's daily mission, and voila you get 2x the number of points compared to the other guy. plus, you can follow the markets and sell the datacores when it's profitable, or daily, rather than trying to offload a zillion every 6 months at a loss. there already are tools in place for you to actively compete.i also think that the majority of your competition isn't expired accounts; rather it's active accounts, the pvp'er or the industrialist who otherwise spends his day playing other aspects of the game, but is also getting some extra income from the rp's.as far as the skillpoints, we've always had that bonus and it's nice. people get bored of the game and need to take a break, if you take away their battleships v should they return, they may not return.so, i disagree. it's a nerf that's not needed; you can already compete in an active way, and nerfing this would result in a loss of players (however small)."
"these things are rewards for not playing the game, i thought the whole point of ccp was to have us playing and using the game, paying accounts to have any benefit...i can't understand why this is still in. if someone wants to talk about bad things and character farming, allowing to put a 1 month skill every two month for free, it's bad..."
"training warfare link specialist v on my trail account while it is inactive. going to train up hopefully 3 hulk pilots in a few months using the trail + 1 gtc thing if possible. after the initial training time you want to know something? i will need them in game and working to pay for their gtcs so they won't be expiring again soon. leave it as it is. it encourages other people to make accounts and get ccp more money. my main is a hulk pilot. turns out mining is less isk an hour than ratting or missioning but scales much better."
"well this is something of a digression into another area i think long overdue for overhaul as well. the fact that by doing nothing someone can make half as much as i do, in fact they can be coasting on an expired account as well, makes actively missioning your r&d agent a fools errand.mind you, i'm not impoverished by these matters. not everything aired is because there is a direct gain for the person championing the cause. i'm well known, for many years, not for my whining but for my thinking & speaking. this is a small thing that could use some critical (& objective) review and debate."
"no. part of what makes eve better than other mmos is that you can take breaks without messing up your training. or, like me, go without internet involuntarily for three freakin months (thank you embarq for having a single-digit iq) without losing much in the way of training time.people have real life issues that are more important than a video game. ccp recognizes this and that is part of why i like this game so much."
"no. just no"
"no thanks. being able to have your skills still training even if your account has expired is a pretty powerful inducement to keep coming back to the game, imo.you may have found the game rather stale and boring, but you set up bs v before you left. your account may have expired last week but suddenly you remember \"hey! bs v finished training a couple days ago! i can fly cap ships now!\" and you go and re-sub your account. happy ending for all concerned, i'd say."

"seriously, why would anyone ever fly one of these things? it is worse than a mining cruiser in every possible way except cargo capacity and possibly price (once you factor in the strip miner), and even then, not by much. it has no capacitor, can barely defend itself against belt rats, and has a laughable mining output.recommend something be done about the uselessness of this ship if mining is looked at by the csm. i would love to see it get some sort of bonus that would make it actually useful to a mining operation; perhaps a stripminer range bonus so it can pick off that lone asteroid 5km away from all the hulks. it definitely needs a capacitor boost; as is, it caps itself on long warps more often than frigates do.support procurer love!"
"i'm supporting the topic because i agree that the procurer is useless, it takes a lot less time to train for a cruiser that can do the same amount of mining if not more, and it only takes another day or two before you can move up to retriever.however, i think the better way to deal with it is to remove the ship altogether. without some kind of change that would require some rebalancing of all the other barges, there's little you can do to make the procurer a viable mining vessel..cruisers would still provide better yield if you change the range, so making it a better miner would be the obvious change, but again you can't do that easily without having to rebalance the other barges. thus i suggest just removing the ship completely."
"well, you also need the procurer to invent the (also pretty useless) skiff."
"with regards to training up for the next in line, there's no reason you wouldn't spend the extra day or so training for the mackinaw and just getting that right off the bat is there? i believe that it's in the same boat as the procurer, except it's slightly more useful since it can deepcore mine whereas cruisers cannot."
"the skiff is the best mercoxit miner in the game. the mackinaw is the best ice miner in the game. they serve different purposes. don't drag exhumers into a discussion on the procurer. this isn't much different from the tech 1 industrials that become blockade runners. as tech 1 ships they are nearly without merit, but as tech 2 they have a role."
"it doesn't need to be usefull. it is designed to be replaced in what? 16 hours? a day of training? when the navatis gets a hardcore buff that makes it a preffered t1 frig over the tier 3 ones then i'll support the tier 1 barge having a reason to live. until then... wise people will mine in a mining cruiser because it outperforms a tier 1 mining barge. and if they have the skills they will mine in a dominix because it outmines a retriever and sometimes a covetor."

"typical omg cap! response. if your going to comment on cap then take a look at how often arty needs to reload and what that does for the dps that is already significantly lower than beams. 1400s are as hard to fit as beams.when artillery was given rubbish tracking it was deserved as at the time you could really hurt ships with the alpha especially smaller ships, but after so many hp boosts and ways to increase hp that alpha is nothing like what it used to be yet the penalties are still there.also ranges have increased with the new apoc giving the lower base range beams much more range (and dps and tracking and no reloading for cap use), rails already offering more range and tracking (especially more tracking on mega) then finally the rokh which can hit even further without any need to fit a tracking module.as i said in the large ac topic not just artillery should be looked at but ammo as well, possibly the range could be helped with a falloff bonus on tremor.basically the downsides for the advantage of no cap use (its the only true advantage) are just to much with the increases in other snipers performance and the already great performance of the rail mega. no one is asking for beam style dps or rail optimal so i'll keep complaining until there is a balanced minmatar style artillery for todays eve."

"you have to take the rough with the smooth. i think the fastest ship should have the weakest long range fire. you have excellent short range fire. autocannons are good enough that amarrians mount them on their ships instead of lasers. now, they may be 'too much' too weak, but i'd definitely say they should be the weakest. i'm not averse to looking at and overhauling them, but i think you'd have to expect to give up the 'capless weapon' bonus in order to make any real progress."
"higher damage modifier compensated with increased rof - supportedbigger clip size, even without stealth dps boost - supported tremor adjustment - supported if spike and aurora are boosted with similar fashion i feel urge to add that rather than having all t2 long range \"sniper\" ammunitions changed, id like to see falloff bonus included to tracking computers range scripst and to tracking enhancers much like it was introduced to tracking disruptors."

"i have to agree with you. if i want to fight someone and they are on the station i have to realize that they are there so that they can see outside, choose their targets wisely, and dock if nessisary. i would be an idiot not to weigh this into the strategy. why insist that people can't fight on stations? should they just stay docked and nobody get to play? why are people demanding that the rules must change so that they can kill more people for making the mistake of undocking or demanding someone stay vulnerable for as long as it takes get revenge? now people that undock, dock, undock, dock into a camp without agroing anyone just to waste people's time and ammo makes me want a redock timer that increases everytime you do that within a set period of time but that is not what the op specified. i have gotten a nice amount of kills on the station with my moros and haven't lost it yet but it wasn't because they were stupid and thought i wouldn't dock. they were bumping me while giving me targets to keep me agro'd trying to get me off of the station so they could kill off my drones and subsequently kill me. they've come close several times but i've been lucky so far. it makes sence though as my moros costs more than a 30 man gang. i can't survive that gang if i'm off the station but if i can down a few of them while taking a risk that i may be knocked off the station it makes for an exciting fight. i can fully understand why that gang would be fuming that i got a coupple of them and they didn't get my one ship but: a) i was unmistakeably on the station and have a kazillian hitpoints. b) i chose the battleground, they chose the attack plan and know the game mechanics. c) they could have won but they failed to achieve the mission objectives (bump or seige button to strand myself for 10 min, keep me aggro'd without taking casualties) d) if i have a chance to loose a 3b isk ship (gotta fit it good for maximum performance) within docking range then i dang-well better have a chance to kill a few hundred mill of their ships for the risk i'm taking, that one of them is successfull at bumping or that they'll use the cyno-bump which has flung me at over 1km/s more than once. d) it's the station. they know i'm going to try to de-agro and dock if they let me. the only reason they're fighting me is to keep me agro'd while they work me away from docking range so they can kill me. and they will kill me if they succeed but nobody makes them do it and they're not doing it because they've been cheated or something. e) the moros is specifically designed for fighting smaller ships. it says so in its info thingy. f) i don't even shoot battleships because they can deagro and tank a moros until they can dock (i loose a drone about every 5 seconds and that cuts down on firepower as well as costing a lot) a moros can't gank a bs unless it enters seige mode and that guarantees death if fighting alone.all in all, the station adds a dimension to fighting that can't be found anywhere else in the game. i'm often online when nobody else in my corp is. to be able to use the station tactically allows me to have sphincter-tightening combat mahem bloodbath heartattacks when i'm alone vs 10-30man fleets in the area and still have a chance of getting some kills or loosing really big. against that many i'm tethered to the station because they would always win otherwise. i have to depend on them choosing to fight me on the station because there is nothing else i can do in that situation. the station doesn't need to be changed because this is another clear example of people not thinking about the endless variations the game can be played in and wanting the game changed to better suit their limited understanding of it."

"i definietly agree.iv introduced a lot of people to eve, but a lot of them got bored to start with due to learning new skills very slowly. i then tell them to learn the learning skills first, but then they dont get into new ships for ages and again lose interest in the game.my idea would be to start new people with higher atributes, which will then slowly degrade to like they are now over the first month or two of gameplay. this would mean that new people can get a decent ship and advance through the game quickly to start with (making them more interested in the game and more likely to stay), and then by their atributes start to drop they will be happy with the ships they have and will be used to the long training times (a lot of my friends were ****ed off by even having to wait an hour or two for a lvl 1 skill when they started)might have some issues with farmers making new accounts following a ban very quickly, but i think this idea could be workable.red"
"what you're saying is that with perfect intel, you'll have better intel. i agree, you will, but i'm not sure that it's necessary for the game or desirable either. i don't mind the idea that people should have to work a little bit in order to scan their system, nor do i mind the idea of a covert fleet having the ability to possibly get by you. the solo pilot in a force recon damn well ought to be able to sneak by me to open a cyno behind the front lines. it shouldn't be automatic, but it should be possible with a bit of luck. that said, one thing you do have a point on is that people will just spam the scan button all the time. as such, the scanner window should have an auto-repeat button, to lower the amount of input the player needs to provide for reconnaissance. also, the ability to sort the data in a useful manner, and perhaps even audio notification filters for when something you want to be notified of comes up."
"no, that post highlighted the problems involved in doing that. that doing so would cause just those problems you are talking about. it was a response to mindstar suggesting just that, and was showing him what would happen.if you did implement that functionality well then what would be the point of removing local(besides making hostile/friendly/neutral counts even easier)? it would be entirely for the purpose of making the mechanic \"feel right\".if they dock in a station then take the station. if they go to a pos, siege the pos. if they jump through a gate follow them and kill them. if its low-sec or high-sec, camp them in. if you aren't willing to jump through a gate, siege a station, siege a pos, or scan them down in a safe spot then they should \"win\" that engagement."
"no it might not be. but i am not saying that. i am saying that reducing the amount of intelligence will undoubtedly be a bad thing.coverts already have the ability to move through space. that it is not perfectly undetected is simply a reflection that is is a game played by humans against humans and not one played by humans against computers[as much as some peoples intelligence seems to be artificial at points]"
"[no support]one of the most fundimental needs in a multiplayer game is that you need to know when you are playing with other people. it's what makes a patroll go to the next system and a mining barge warp. there should be no effort in finding out if i can interact with others in the curent system. not having the thrill of expectation when a player of an oposing team is around just ruins the whole idea of multiplayer or makes it too stressfull if you could be pounced on without a reasonable chance of warning. if i'm searching each system on a patroll route just to find out if anyone is playing eve in the area then too much of the game is now devoted to determining if there is a game to be played. any feature that gives the feeling of being alone negates the entire concept of a multiplayer game.the only real problem with people knowing i've entered system is that it's easy to exploit local and log off or warp/cloak. a 5 minute dissapear timer on logging off and perhaps a 'cloak doesn't work so good' timer if someones hull was recently ionized from taking dammage in any kind of combat would seem to solve all the most reasonable complaints about local. simply \"i want to sneek up on everyone that isn't scanning like a maniac\" does not hold any water."
"definitely /signed"
"yes"
"/signed"
"for sure..."
"love that idea. just put everyone at -20 again to start with. they should have serious corp standings by this point anyway."
"this idea is better. i don't support the op, but i support this. agents should simply have a quality growth value that is reduced each time a mission is completed for that agent. this would allow underused agents to gain quality and popular agents to lose quality as their growth value adjusts. system security should determine the default growth value.then remove the +20/-20 caps set on quality and allow them to settle wherever the populace lets them. at that point low security bonuses on rewards is probably unnecessary and should be removed as well, allowing effective quality alone to determine your rewards.this would also rectify the issues with level 5 agents, as these agents gain enormous levels of quality more players will make use of them.we don't need another way of determining your personal relationship with an agent or corporation. we already have standings that adjust the effective quality of your agent on top of their innate quality and your negotiation skill.if this did actually make all corporations the same from the perspective of the mission runner then lp rewards ought to be more fragmented and/or expanded upon in a distinct way. for example, shipping companies might offer faction expanded cargoholds, mining companies might offer faction lasers/crystals, etc. currently 99% of distinction in lp stores is handled on the faction level, and that doesn't make much sense. why joint harvesting hands out amarr navy energy turrets i don't know. that makes them seem more similar than anything else."
"guys, you don't need dynamic agent quality. it's pointless and will have the same effect as giving all agents in a security zone the same quality. if all lvl 4 agents in hi sec are quality 0, the mission runner population will spread out evenly among all of them to reduce lag, which is exactly the same result you'd get in an optimal situation with dynamic agent quality, except that involves a lot more coding and work. all that is necessary is to remove the fact that some agents are just objectively better than others."
"part of the point of adjusting qualities is to avoid people globbing up at trade hubs. if quality was non-existant the systems within 5 jumps of jita/rens/etc. would become the most popular."
"i support the idea of having the quality system changed, but i don't know what would be best.i always like the idea that you start running missions you are at -20. then you add you the standings for agent+corp+faction+????? (negotiations) to get your agent standing. so when you start running missions for a new agent/corp/faction you will have low quality. but over time you get more and more pay because the agent/corp/factions likes you more. if you move agents in the same corp/faction you don't have to start over, because they know about you. but you do need to develop a relationship with that agent to get better pay.this also rewards people who are willing to take a stand and work on their faction standings for one side, rather then trying to be on good terms with both.just my 2 isk.edit: to give support"
"standings and negotiation already affect the effective quality of an agent and produce the result you seek. that is how it works now."
"you are correct, currently this is the forumla for effective quality:effective quality = base quality + personal standing + (negotiations skill * 5)i am suggesting that we remove the base quality, and then have personal standing (with the agent), and corp standing, and faction standing, along with negotiations creat all for the effective standing."
"another good point! keep it up."
"having the main goal of agent progresion being to get to the one best agent where everyone else is... doesn't seem too bright. they probably did that because they can then move that agent to correct traffic problems. if all agents were of equal quality then people would tend to cluster where the best market access is. it's easy to move an agent but you can't really move the markets. you are smart and will probably go to one that's more peacefull but the majority (and you know it if you read the threads that are based on problems with the game) will insist on staying in their favorite lagy system while demanding something be done about the lag.another, harder option would be to inconvenience all the mission runners and make the agents only have a certain amount of missions available for everyone and have amount be based on lag in the system. when a peacefull system becomes the favorite of too many people and lag kicks in then all the sudden you can't allways get a mission there. then you have to hike to the next available agent.i supose the only really good thing to be said about my idea would be ammunition against whiney miners that say that mission runners have it so much better... but keep mining on, oblivious to the fact that if they know the other guy has it better, has the ability to train the skills and get the ship that guy has, and can improve themselves, but stay there and mine and gripe about mining, then they are foolish."
"long overdue"
"actually quite the contrary. i would like to see more people in 0.0 and that the moment that means more excitement, more dynamic conflict and more motive for being there. at the moment the only reason for taking an outpost is because you want to become a station-holder yourself. and commit to all that means in long term pos maintenance and that style of game-play. but allow these things to be blown up and you have involvement with people who want to hurt their in-game enemies without necessarily becoming what they fight. destroying a fixed strongpoint should be an option in any wargame, and what is eve territorial conflict in 0.0 if not a grand multi-player wargame on some level?"
"jade, i take it you feel the rewards of 0.0 are significantly greater than the risks (currently). thus you propose to make stations destructible to increase the risk (losing the cost of the station and the stuff in it) to re-balance the equation?or do you support they be destructible as anything built by a player should be able to be destroyed by another player?"
"you can already take space and then enforce neutrality, effectively making the space as ****ty as you want. hell, you can take space and then let no one dock there, effectively taking the station out of circulationeve territorial conflict is a grand war game and in acknowledging it as such you need to accept some basic realities. realities like \"allowing alliances to destroy stations allows alliances to constrict space extending the area that they can effectively control\" and realities like \"eve is not a game like any other war game since it has no end point\". in a typical war game what the board looks like at the end doesn't matter. because at the end of a typical war game you fold the board up and go home. not so for eve, at the end of a war in eve, the board is still there for others to play on.your idea will not put more people in 0.0 it will do the opposite. this is why its so confusing when you state contradictory goals."
"supported!"
"why would you ever blow up something you could take? it doesn't make any sense."
"actually, the way it's phrased, you would be blowing up something you already have taken. wrap your head around that one. as for why you would choose to, even if a different mechanic than jade's was used, it'd be because it's easier to destroy it than to conquer it. same reason you shell a city instead of just walking in and taking it - it's not as nice when you finish, but it'll be yours."
"it is too early for us to consider this topic seriously (and the specific example is, in my opinion, totally out of order with gameplay). other issues such as changes to cap ships online and the sov system are far more important. i am against this proposal"
"even if it was harder to destroy than hold it would be something we would do.because its easier to not defend it and come back later when someone puts up a station and blow it up again than it is to expend resources to defend the space."
"yes and (partially) - if you review the example i cite you'll see i would support a partial destruction solution at least for the initial implementation. ie the outpost goes \"boom\" but people's personal hangers are still accessible from the wreck. basically alliance takes a hit - individual players generally don't.this too. especially in 0.0 space which is the full-pvp zone in eve where everything should be put on the line."
"maybe you want to blow it up simply to hurt a war enemy? but since you don't want to become exactly like the war enemy you're fighting you don't want to be bound by the same mechanics and paradigms they play by. in war sometimes you just want to blow up the enemies base. doesn't mean you want to live there yourself."
"this is an oversight that needs to be corrected asap. i should be able to show my disgust with an idea without relying on someone to actually read my post out of the pages of other ones that are generally shorter than mine and therefore easier to barely read and then dissreguard."
"ever since the introduction of faction ammo most t2 ammo has been uselessi admit there is a minor role for some ammos and a few still shine (range boosting ammo) but the entire market on them tankedthey simply need to be redone.i admit that having them outdamage faction ammo would not be in line with ccp's desires for combat duration so damage is not an optionhaving the penalty effects be applied for each system having loaded that ammo type realy gimps the ships with many hardpoints over the ones with less and an added dps bonusso i would suggest a system that does not have have a penalty nor gives a major bonus to damaget2 missiles could for instance lower actual speed (not max) by 1 or 2% per hit making them indirectly support other weaponsystems and increas the time a target needs to get to warp (even prefent it if there are enough of you)the rage version with more dage ofset witrh a greater target signature allows a ship to engate a larger opponent miore effectively without boosting its damage against the same sized ship class removing other penalties from these missile types (rocket, ham, torp, cap torp) might do it but they should outperform faction missiles against larger targets.retaining a form of precision missiles (light, heavy, cruise and the missing capital cruise) without penalties do deal with smaller sized ship a bit more effectively might work as wellfor gunnery ammo:the ranged version seem to work although i personally would prefer slighly less range and slightly more damage allowing t1 a part in sniping as wellthe damage version tha5t reduces range and tracking without outperforming faction ammo by a good margin is a sick joke. either have it reduce rangge and increase damage and tracking (compatible with the general mechanic less range = more damage) or make them equivalent to short range ammo with an intresting side effect (for instance laser ammo make targets suffer more from heat (if used by the target), ballistic ammo give a chance to deactivate a module on the target ship (as if deactivated by the user). blaster ammo could reduce weapon sig radius slightly or maybe other have better idears?"
"one time on evetv stavros said that he'd heard a dev confirm this would be included. anyone remember where/when?"
"an afk player is easily determined (from the server's point of view) as someone who sits in one spot or has a steady automatic movement pattern (like orbit or go forward). a non-afk player is there and participating with the game somehow. if you could detect the afk and not detect the active players then all would be happy in eveland.here's how to do it:- make locating and unmasking a cloaker a long and deliberate ordeal so that an active player can react to it- on successfull attempt to counter the cloaker's cloak they become uncloaked but is otherwise able to respond by warping and/or re-cloakingsooo... let's say that a cloaker was probeable as \"cloaked object\" but had a reduced... what's the word? scan strength? so that you could probe him but you'd fail more often than if he was uncloaked. then after your final short ranged probe where you end up on the same grid you launch a new probe that pings the surrounding area. it takes a decent amount of time to finish its cycle and then it either fails to decloak or successfully decloaks. if the person was not afk and was doing anything a long duration cloaker would be doing then they should have picked up probes on scan several minutes before you got there and would have done something. if they recloak on you then you just have to be ready to run them down as is usual for people that cloak. if they're not afk it's their right to do so. it's the ccp given right for a cloaker to hide from you... they just shouldn't be able to cloak and then go play rl while discouraging you from playing eve.also, op guy... the emotional content of your post is like yelling \"don\"t kick me!!!\"... you're going to get kicked for doing that."
"afk cloaks are annoying when ur trying to kill them, but i live in lowsec, arocitas alliance frequently send in cloaking inties and stuff. we ignore them, until they show up on scan. then we hunt them and chase them off.this is like saying that people should timeout if they dont move thier mouse or something in eve when they're sitting in a station afk. theres no real difference between an afk cloaker and a guy in the station who is afk.if he pops up on scanner then he's either up to something or he just undocked. when he uncloaks u know u have company. and if ur in 0.0/lowsec, you should always be watching scanner and local. him being docked or cloaked makes no difference."
"in my opinion, and it's only an opinion, this is good in theory but not in practice. here is why (from a buddy that does this):1) logon in favorite system2) cloak and go back to work in rl3) periodically watch scanner for ratters (they have to make a living) 4) locate belt of ratter using scanner5) decloak, warp to belt, kill ratter, loot wreck6) go back to scan point and cloak while ratter's buddies form up and hunt you in vein7) get more work done in rl8) repeat steps 3-7 until time to go home9) make sure alt has market stocked with new ratting ships, parts, and ammonow i'm not saying this isn't a cleaver idea and a good way to kill time at work but for the duration that he's not playing the game the other people clearly are. they should have an oportunity during the time he's afk and alt+tabbed to do something about that specific thing he's doing. sure they can hit *scan* every 2 seconds for the brief period every hour or two when he's decloaked and inbound. they could fit stabs or rat in pairs too. sure cloaks are meant to suck for other people but there should be something more reasonable a person can do in an afk cloaker situation like this.again, i'm only suporting an improvement to combat afk cloakers, not scouts or intel gatherers that are actively playing the game. this is not related to afk in a station because they have more delays induced, have given themselves away before able to locate a target, and are much more vulnerable. currently cloaking in a safespot has zero risk yet provides great rewards when used like this."

"i can't find the thread in question, unfortunately, but what i recall as being said was that in-station and out-of-station players are handled by different parts of the server, and mixing them isn't really feasible. if i'm remembering incorrectly, or something in that vein, then i'll support this idea, since it seems like a good one. but it's not something i'm willing to eat lag for."
"[no support]on the surface it sounds like a realistic and good idea. in practice it allows an indestructable fc to command a station fight from inside the station, without the lag of his client having to respond to the actions and effects of other ships. it also allows multiple people, who have a selection of ships and fittings in the station, to bypass the undock/dock/change ship/undock delays. this would give so much more strategic advantage to being docked than just simple cowering. people fighting over space with unconquerable stations (this crowd has increased a lot in the last year) will likely have both sides staying docked, peering out the windows, ready to switch ships and engage only something they know they have 110% chance of completely obliterating. is that the eve you want?"
"lol heres some things that might interest you:1 - if theres hostiles in local, that arent in the station with you, then they're either outside somewehere, or docked in another station.2 - if you undock and immediately stop ur ship, you will remain invulnerable. if you hit dock straight away, it says 'plz wait 20 secs' by doing this you lose your invulnerability. so... stop ur ship, wait 20-30 secs, then redock.if you have any brains there are only a few stations that could catch you out (those where the undock point is out of docking range) in which case its a crap station.and this would cause immense lag. imagine jita...bad idea.kkthnxbye."
"i am caldari but love my drones too."

"how about we remove insurance payouts for ships lost in 0.0. if you can fly around in null sec, you're a big boy/girl now and don't need your hand held.i agree some balancing is in order, but the op does not mention the real titan problem, which is their use in tandem with cyno jammers. outside of that, they are ok.one thing i think should be mentioned is how pos's are sieged. any responsible commander will not put dreads into siege without having sub-capitals locking down the gates. the result is that you get dread pilots shooting the structures while the sub-capitals are bored out of their minds."
"lol @ removing insurance.ask capital pilots how many of them insure carriers.... not many. i've had my carrier for a long time now, yeah i've been hotdropped ontop of enemies, onto gates and into pos's. but not once have i insured my ship. i fly my carrier with the full knowledge that if i screw up, i will lose 1b or so straight isk. bigger ships have bigger risks.carriers dont tank massive ammounts of dps. they are slow, and virtually imobile because of thier lack of gate jumping ability. the drones are 10-20m a pop. and they do regularly pop just fyi. the fuel is expensive, and they cant go long distances on the fuel they can carry. before the nerf you could stuff an itty 5 and a viator in a carrier and jump around all day. now you cant. i used to even have haulers in my bay that had a small pos tower, fuel for about 4 days and guns/ewar batteries. in theory i could have lived in my carrier. no longer possible.1 scorpion = jammed carrier. then its an oversized freighter with a tank.capitals have become popular, but they are bound to have. as players progress they will get more skills and want to fly them... so what can be done? not alot.if theres more of them around then more of them die. fun to kill, industrialists can build and not have to worry about selling them etc etc."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"you still get ~300mil back on default insurance if it blows up."
"i own a dread and a carrier and feel i can talk with some understanding of them. also i haven't lost a cap yet so my view may be skewed a little. i'm one person buying my own things and use my caps only when reasonably sure that i'm not about to throw them away.1) titans seem to be a bit of a fumble but i've never encountered one face to face (unless you count it's bridge) so can't realy comment on them so much and am skeptical of others who haven't encountered them and probably don't have any good understanding of them either. from what i have seen though they are making their way into our npc owned 0.0 homeland where it's much safer for them to nuke gangs that have a very low probability of fielding an anti-titan response... this is how it is in my neck of the woods anyway. this is crap imo and if there was any serious cap problem then this would be my foundation of the arguement. in the crap 0.0 owned by npc's most of the gangs are composed of many small ships and rarely cap ships. this is too inviting a target for a ship that can push a button and destroy the entire oposing gang with almost zero risk. my instinct tells me that the dd should have some ballancing mechanism that bases its dammage output on the total ship tonnage currently in the grid. this way if there isn't a significant cap ship presance then the dd will largely fizzle. consequently this would still correct a battleship swarm attacking a pos seiging party.2) dreads, i've found are usefull for a) killing pos's b) cynobumping my moros and putting the hurt on me c) in the case of the moros, fighting small ships on a station where it can constantly redock and reload its small drone bay 3) dreads are not usefull for the everyday person or small corp (with the possible exception being the moros). their prohibitive cost, limited usefullness, and nessessity in numbers for pos warfare excludes smaller alliances from challenging sovernty or playing the dread card in a counter hot-drop.4) dreads are not overly abundant unless you consider their disproportionate distribution. one dread does nothing but 5 dreads and the ability to survive the financial loss can do something. that doesn't make your team super or anything it's just the point where you can start to carefully flex a little bit. a major alliance would still pee on you because of it's ability to replace dreads.5) carriers are the ships that seem to be everybodies goal... especially miners for some reason. it seems that frequently people get a carrier and then out of want to use it for something besides an icon in the station hanger, will use it for ratting or mining. i've been involved in 2 dieing this way and both times it was to battleships. usually a carrier can't do enough dammage to a battleship quick enough to kill it. the bs simply warps away and reps it's self in warp. it warps over and over to keep the fighters from apearing while it heals sufficiently or until the fighters are reported as withdrawn and placed on a new target that is at the fight. in doing this, battleships can easily kill a stranded carrier without losses. these carrier populations are kept in check without troubble and people keep an eye out for stranded carriers.6) in my experiance, where i live, carriers are not over abundant. my reasons for assuming this is that carriers are employed mostly hugging the crap out of a station all alone, supporting a pos attack or repair, transporting stuff, and very rarely in a hot-drop. if carriers were over abundant in my area i would see them dropped more often and counter dropped. if caps were crowding out subcaps there would be roaming cap gangs instead of the roaming nano/ecm gangs. if anything is getting crowded out it's the battleships in my opinion as they have so much troubble killing groups of anything smaller than them, are primary targets for jammers, can't warp or move fast enough to keep up, and cost more than smaller ships that can do the job better"
"yes"
"would be especially interesting to see from my pov if the actual cost of the individual capitals ship types (in terms of training and actual isk) still reflects their usefulness/versatility or has run askew..."
"i'm uncertain on the solution, but i agree about the problem."

"oh christ, not this again. it's being discussed, just look at my posts. you even have the floor, if you want it. just because not everybody is into walls of text doesn't mean it's being discussed. now, i'll agree that \"/signed\" is particularly useless in this thread, since the op was a request for thoughts and not a request for a specific change, but even a statement that people think that there's an issue that needs addressing has a little value."
"what was to happen, if you kill a guy who has been playing 2 months in his caracal, you yourself have been playing 6 months. then the 2 month old guy gives his killrights to a 3-4 year old player.would you be happy? i think not.i have a bounty on me, and it makes no difference to killrights. because killrights allow you to kill the ship... not the pod.so as reguards the ingame bounty system, transferable killrights make no difference. this appears yet again to be another thread that is biased, giving the carebear the option to have someone else do what he cant or wont do.if you have / think you have the ability to avenge your own loss. then do it, or pay a merc corp to do it. the killrights system works fine as it is."

"there's an easy solution to your problem: don't kill 2-month old players. if you want to fight carebears legitimately, declare war. or become a bounty hunter yourself.just a reminder that the eve economy works because of carebear miners, researchers, and manufacturers. they're the reason that ships and equipment are as cheap as they are. imagine if you had to mine for and build all your ships and equipment from scratch. the way the skills break down, we can't all be combat specialists. but those who have chosen not to go into combat professions should be able to benefit from a market for specialized muscle, just as that muscle benefits from a market for specialized ships and equipment. transferable killrights legitimizes mercenaries and makes the market for them more efficient.you make a good point. the loss of a ship is still a loss, though; i think it's fair. a bounty hunter should be able to charge much more to podkill, since he'll have to take a sec hit in empire to do it."
"aye"
"not signed. i agree that the bounty system needs some looking into, but this is definitely not the way to go. i have seen some other alternatives (even detailed one myself) that would solve this issue far better than the ability to give others your kill rights. as stated before, the proposed system can be easily exploited and--honestly--doesn't make a lot of sense. there are other options out there that would be far more feesible than this."

"could you explain the difference between your proposed solution (as shown in the link you provided) and transferable killrights? it sounds to me like we're agreeing completely. the original victim is contracting the killright to a bounty hunter. i like your fleshed-out contract details; they make sense. as you say, bounty to be paid only if target is actually destroyed, but the person placing the bounty should be able to dictate the duration of the contract (maybe within a certain max and min) and the collateral themselves.i agree, when killrights are transferred, the original aggressor should be notified who is hunting them. the hunted can already return fire (anyone can legally return fire when fired upon), so i don't think it's necessary for them to be able to legally shoot their hunter on sight.illicit bounties (where the person hiring the bounty hunter does not have a legal killright to the hunted) should still exist, and the framework of the contract should still work, but the bounty hunter assumes all security penalties they may incur. these will still exist under the table anyway; this can be a way of tracking them and keeping all involved parties honest.any of these systems, though, can be abused by an alt of the original aggressor acquiring the killrights and killing himself for the bounty, making sure to minimize his losses. any ideas on how to prevent or minimize this?"
"good idea."
"the most straight-forward way to fix bounty hunting that i could think of so far and which hopefully has no loopholes (not easy...) would be this:- transferable kill rights by simple contracts, public contracts would require a fee or otherwise the hunted will just snatch them up with an alt (he can do so anyway, but at least it will cost him).- a new icon for the overview, pilots for which kill rights are available (just a detail).- context menu option for such pilots: show kill rights- once kill rights are acquired, the hunted gets kill rights on the hunter immediately, the hunter gets kill rights after a delay of a minute or so (avoiding nasty backstabbing traps). maybe no notification for the hunted, but it appears in his kill rights list. the kill right for the hunted expires as soon as the hunter loses the kill right, so acquired kill rights are always mutual.- bounty system as is, but with payouts based on guaranteed destroyed value (e.g. 60% of platinum insurance value for ships, 80% of clone value for pods).- no insurance payouts for pilots with negative sec standings / bounties. this is probably too controversial, but sadly i don't see how else the hunted can be stopped from collecting his own bounty by blowing up well insured ships. this would also obsolete \"no insurance payout for suicide attacks\".i did like the various ideas of combining bounty with contracts at first, but i have yet to see a concept that would not allow the hunted to collect his own bounty, or which would be otherwise complicated or involve pve (i'm not saying that those solutions are bad, just offering an alternative).partial payout should also increase the motivation to actually put bounty on a pirates head, because it guarantees that it won't be used up before the target suffered actual financial damage.i like the system described above because it would make it very simple and straight forward for bounty- and pirate hunters to find legal targets, and hopefully help create a better balance between \"bad guys\" and \"good guys\" in empire space (right now it's mostly \"bad guys\" vs. \"carebears\" afaict). pirates would still get the advantage of a larger selection of targets and easy hauler kills, while legal hunters get the advantages of a positive sec status and the additional income from bounties (as well as the in-character moral high ground :)).in any case i am glad that bounty hunting is in the spotlight and i am sure that the csm will do a fine job at presenting the various ideas to ccp, who will hopefully come up with a solution that actually works. i am very much looking forward to what comes out of this."
"via my system, multiple people can take out contracts. as long as you have a bounty on your head, someone can take out a contract on your life. the main difference between my idea and a simple transferrence of kill rights is that in my system, you don't get to choose who hunts the person who you have kill rights against. it's open to the public. at the same time, you aren't recieving isk for your kill rights, the collaterals are an isk sink. and thirdly, you still maintain your kill rights even if you put up a bounty. so there ends up being more pvp all around while also making it a possibly lucrative profession. and even if the hunted isn't notified of their hunter, the hunter should at least be kos to the hunted. that way the hunted could, if nothing else, tell when an enemy just entered his area. after all, it's a concord sanctified contract during which the hunter forfeits his rights to protection. as far as alts go, this could happen, but then again it is even easier to exploit at the moment. so at least it's a mild deterrent. besides, most pirates are fond of their bounties, and the higher your bounty, the more likely you can get pvp. so most would rather keep the bounty on them, i find (i would, at any rate)."
"so, a public contract, just like other public contracts. sounds good.i think i'd rather see this float freely on the market. is hiring someone to avenge your loss more valuable to the victim than getting to legally kill an aggressor is to the hunter? i honestly don't know and i'd be very curious to see which way that would swing.i'm open to convincing, but i'm predisposed to say that if you hire someone else to do your dirty work, you forfeit the right to do that work yourself if you're suddenly given the opportunity.fair point. maybe there should be an indicator in the local channel or on the overview of who has the right to kill you? we already have a white skull for someone with a bounty on their head, how about a red skull for someone with permission to kill you for a bounty?i really like the ideas that have been brought up in this thread. if csm presents this to ccp and ccp likes it, they've got a rich mine here for ways it could be implemented."
"minmatar battleships, pvp fit(no tackle, t2 gear, no rigs, faction/t2 ammo), all level v skills:maelstrom: 1144 dps dealt, 720 dps tanked, 68k effective hp, 1042 m/stempest: 1121 dps dealt, 399 dps tanked, 60k effective hp, 1358 m/styphoon: 917 dps dealt, 211 dps tanked, 68k effective hp, 1453 m/s (also, better scan resolution than a vagabond, since it's got room for 2x sensor booster ii)they're only low dps in comparison to other battleships, they still do more damage than any sub-battleship save an astarte. tempest: 1358 m/s. hyperion: 1198 m/s. they have the same align time, but the pest is still 13% faster. and that's comparing it to gallente, who are the second-fastest race. look at an abaddon - it goes 984 m/s, meaning the pest is 38% faster at linear speed, and it aligns 10% faster too. if nothing in eve is bad, then nothing is good either. quality is relative. and what i said was that the weapon system was supposed to be bad, not that the ships using it are. a tempest can't beat your face in as well as a dominix, or shoot you from as far away as a rokh, but it's faster than either, giving it the ability to disengage from a fight it can't win(and that's before you nano-fit it). an autocannon doesn't measure up to a blaster, but that doesn't mean an autocannon-fit ship is worse than a blaster-fit ship. neutron blaster cannon ii with void = 6.8 km optimal, 6.3 km falloff. 800mm repeating artillery ii with hail = 3 km optimal, 10 km falloff. their t2 ammo ranges match up at one falloff almost exactly, meaning that the blaster is better-ranged from 3-13 km, and the autocannon is better-ranged from 13-23 km. as for the ammos, you can fit faction ammo in an autocannon, deal almost as much damage as the hail, be able to change damage type if you see the need to do so, and your range beats those piddly blasters any day. the mael feels like an amarr ship or something - a tub with good dps and tank - agreed. the pest has room for 3 damage mods(2x t2, 1x basic) the way i fit it, so i don't know what your problem is there. it could use more turret slots if you want to really rock, but for having 6 it's a monster. and the phoon is a weird little boat that defies all explanation. in summary, while large ac's suck, minmatar battleships don't. that was my whole point here."
"if large ac's suck, but minmatar bs that use large ac's don't suck when fitting large ac's, then large ac's don't suck. so if only one of them is sub-optimal when fitting large acs and the others aren't then the problem isn't in the acs its in the ship that isn't doing its job properly."
"i have to agree with this one, though im not sure if the issue can be solved solely by twieking projectiles or minnie battleships.if i remember right, tempest with max skills is the only minnie bs hull - due the dual damage bonus from hull - that gives more dps out of 800mm repeating ii than siege missile launcher ii in cases you dont have room for damage mods. if you dont have minnie bs lvl4, fitting 4x siege missile launcher ii's and 4x 800mm repeating ii's will most likely give better dps over 6x 800mm repeating ii's and 2x siege missile launcher ii's.in maelstorm (3 launcher slots) you need atleast 1x gyro ii and in typhoon i doubt even 2x gyro ii's are enough to boost 800mm repeating ii dps over what siege missli launcher ii can provide.ok, comparing two totally different weaponsystems has its own issues and autocannons are not about damage, but i recon were not far from situation where fitting everything but projectiles to minnie bs will give you the best damage output and i find this issue disturbing. it sure would be nice to be able fit ac's to minnie battleships to get the best dps possible.ps: maxed out char + maelstrom fitting full rack of neutron blaster cannon ii's with cn am will give 506 dps when 800mm repeating artillery ii's with rf emp only adds up to 468 dps"
"lmao mythical fits, now with the exact same setups go compare the tanks besides the fact that no one would use that tempest or typhoon setup.wrong. hyperion is 1261 m/s so tempest doesn't even have 100m/s advantage. besides it taking 3+ cycles to get to that max difference so the difference will actually be less. sure compare the damage, range and tank difference with the abaddon while at it.everything can be good, but in different ways! blasters are king of peak dps, pulse are king of range. point is ac's offer something different but at bs level there's just no point if you can fly another race and i'm speaking as a minmatar bs pilot with t2 projectiles, torps, heavy drones, bs 5, basically the works but has a amarr char with amarr bs 4 that performs better as there's just no role for acs at large level if you have an alternative.here's a lesson, all t2 close range ammo sucks. just minmatar don't have an alternative because emp sucks and so does the faction ammo based on it. but eft warriors expect minmatar pilots to use hail because its the highest mythical dps.either fix t1 ammo and its faction varients or hail.you fit 3 gyro's on a tempest and ones a basic?! talk about rubbish fit, i'd love to see your glass tank and your use of it. calling it a monster only proves you've never flown the thing. any self respecting pilot knows the tempest is weak (even goum says it needs something)."
"no, it does mean they suck but the ship was compensated through another method (extra drone damage for example). i'd happily lose a drone from maelstrom if it got more damage from its turrets especially if it got more range (ie from per-tier system). tempest / typhoon don't need anything taken away if large ac's were improved."
"tbh:maelstorm: it's really fine, but it could really use a tad more agility (think, 10%), as it's one of the worst handling bs and feels incredibly un-minmatar. it handles much worse then most of its counterparts. room for spare drones would be beautiful but isn't all that necessary.typhoon: it's fine, barring one small detail. it could really use is switching armour/shield hp amounts. it is annoying to no end that a ship built for armour tanking has more shield hp then armour, and considering that it's not a huge hp difference, it wouldn't unbalance the ship in any way.tempest: meh, the tempest. it gets outpreformed by its tier 1 / tier 3 counterparts at whatever you try, but it's 'versatile'. wanting to keep that flavour, i would do three things (the last one is a minor issue, but still annoying):(a) give the tempest 100m3 bandwidth (slighly increasing damage output) and 175m3 dronebay (for a pack of lights plus a pack of mediums).(b) give the tempest 10% more agility (it's straight line speed is fine, but it handles horribly, particularly for a minmatar ship).(c) switching the tempest's armour hp and shield hp values. again, as a armour tank (mostly, it's the popular way to fit one) it needs to be focused on armour hp. the change is marginal, but it would help the ship in its most popular role.from there, i'd see how it pans out - but at least it'd get a bit more damage output and would be more minmatar.as it is, large acs are so-so; they lose a number of advantages which medium acs have over medium blasters (particularly because of the ships fitting them), but any major changes would still leave the tempest in the dust and would boost the already good ships. maybe tracking would be nice, currently a megathron is better at both ganking big things and small things then a tempest is, since the tempest uses two damage bonuses to get reasonable dps while the megathron gets a tracking bonus to play with (as only one damage bonus brings its turrets up to awesome dps)."
"mael does 800 dps from turrets alone with 3 gyro ii, 800 iis and rf emp.it also has the grid to fit 3 falloff rigs for 30km falloff with rf emp easily.while doing those two, it can still fit a bastard tank in the mids.where exactly does that need a boost?"
"the tempest"
"i can only get 765dps out of said setup (you must be using some hw's on top of eft all lvl5 skills), but i get 831dps if i make it 3x magstabs and neutrons and cn am.one could think ac fitted mael would outdps blaster fitted mael after the 25% rof bonus those ac's get, dont you think?nah, ac's are just fine"
"something is wrong with your character, i get 805 dps at all 5s with no hardwirings."
"last time i checked 805 was less than 831 so his point is still valid."
"i have 8x 800mm repeating artillery ii's fitted with 3x gyrostabilizer ii's and rep fleet emp l on barrels, also all the affecting skills show as lvl5 and it tells me 765dps. if im truly getting wrong number someone should check if my blaster dps was also off"
"so large blasters suck and need to be boosted because the megathron would suck if it only had 50 cubes of drone bay?that is ******ed.[fake edit: 855 for blasters on a maelstrom, but the acs have a whole **** tonne more range. if the acs are using hail its 890 dps on them, and you can easily fit 3 falloff rigs for more range than a blaster ship could ever hope to have]only if blasters don't use cap, are as easy to fit as the 800mm iis and have 30km falloff with similar pg use[hint, they don't]"
"it's 804.6 for 8x 800mm t2 ac with 3x gyro t2 and rf emp.with 8x neutrons t2 with 3x mfs t2 and cn am its 855 although will have serious fitting issues nevermind range with such a heavy and slow ship which is why the hyperion closed the small gap between gallente bs and tempest while all the other tier 3 bs were made slow and heavy.your being idiotic. i didn't say anything like that so stop with the \"what if\" rubbish because its nothing like the situation described. maelstrom has the max number of turrets possible and a rof bonus so only way to give it more damage is through drone bay.typhoons ac damage is pathetic, tempests ac damage is pathetic, maelstroms isn't bad so if ac damage was increased (such as through the ammo) and any other changes like falloff per tier that would help maelstrom the most then knocking a heavy drone off it would balance the whole lot up."
"okay, so you get about 30 dps more with blasters. that's about the dps from one small turret. big deal. also, you get 30km+ range with acs; blasters are within 15km. and the blasters will be using cap, and will therefore make it harder to run a tank. on top of that, the mael is somewhat bulky and slow, and therefore isn't cut out for a blaster boat. the reason the mael seems to be un-minmatar is that it has a defined role: that of sitting back from the fight and raining hell on the enemy. the phoon and pest are much more flexible. that said, i've personally witnessed a single mael (with the help of myself in a stealth bomber) beat a team of two hyperions that were using ecm drones. the mael pilot had to use 3 cap charges the entire fight and never hit armor. and to dissuade the comments, both hyperion pilots were professional mercs and had more than 15mil sp each. just because you get marginally more dps out of blasters doesn't mean they're better than acs. only an idiot would sacrifice 15km of range for 30 dps."
"no, that is exactly what you said. \"domis blaster damage is pathetic. megathrons blaster damage is pathetic. hyperions isn't bad so if blaster damage was increased (such as through the ammo) and any other changes that would help hyperion, the most then knocking a heavy drone off it would balance the whole lot up.\"bull ****ing ****. all ships need to be considered in their entirety. two of the ships that use large acs are fine and/or very good. one of the ships is not.that doesn't mean there is a problem with large acs it means there is a problem with the one ship which is not fine.or hell, here is a better example:idiots: waaa, large lasers suck, my apoc is terrible!not idiots: no, the geddon and abaddon are fine, the apoc sucks. so its not the large lasers, its the apoc.if you took all the drones off the geddon it would suck too, but that doesn't mean large lasers suck, it means that if you took off all the drones, the geddon would suck."
"but what you just said isn't what you said either, your changing the statement and claiming its the same.the fact the ships being compared are nothing like your comparison is obviously beyond you but keep trying to make the same point with increasing hostility until no one can be bothered to discuss things with you like normal .what i'm saying is more damage should come from ac's than the other sources (drones and missiles) than the current balance, they're the racial weapon after all. increasing the ac performance will help tempest especially and also the typhoon a bit but will also shift some of the maelstroms damage to its turrets."

"first, stop with the eft. no one actually uses hail due to the penalties."
"i had \"include reload time in dps\" ticked on thus lower dps. by ignoring reload time, neutron setup i used to show how autocannons in my opinion lack dps on shorter range, goes up to 855dps. ofcourse blaster setup (optimal rigs) would dominate by its dps only up to ~12km compared to ac setup (falloff rigs) but then again maelstorm with mega pulses (optimal rigs) will outdps autocannon fit starting from ~14km all the way up to ~28km. anyway, the reason i brought these lolfits up is that in my opinion they are way too good when you remember that were using completely wrong weapon system with hull that has rof bonus to projectiles and should shine with that weaponsystem.in scene i brought up autocannons are second best on close range, second best on long range (after 30km your only scratching paint), they have second best tracking (though only by .00012 so lets call it shared \"the best\"). only thing they really have going for em is the most cap friendly tittle, and even this tittle can be questioned when you think how meny of closerange cookiecutter/fotm setup are build around effective hp buffer tanks... if you go and try the same thing in hulls like megathron and apoc or geddon you will notice that in these hulls the \"right\" weaponsystem is the best on most areas if not in all of em. so why cant maelstorm (or typhoon, it has the same 5% rof bonus) do the same with autocannons? is it because autocannons dont really have role due somewhat poor design? is it because these ships are not made for autocannons in the way like megathrons, apocs and geddons are made for their weaponsystems?id say its because both! most, if not every minnie bs needs little finetuning and so does both autocannons and artilleries. id say its impossible to fix all these issues that minmatar battleships have by only looking one possible source of the problem."
"why should more damage come from acs? why change 3 ships and 1 or more weapon systems in order to fix 1 ship? its ******ed, when you balance you change as little as possible in order to get the desired result in order to lower the chances of unintended side effects.and no, the ships being compared are very similar. if you took the drones away from either of them they would suck. its the same problem with the pest except it never had them in the first place."
"i think large autocannons are fine, given that they use no cap. to be balanced, they have to be 'less good' than either blasters or pulses. that is, if you ignore cap, the autocannon should look less attractive. tempest could use some help though."
"you're a mwding minmatar ship, so range isn't the issue. you've got a buddy webbing them to effectively nil, so tracking isn't the issue. and you're in a cap-boosted pvp fit, so cap recharge isn't the issue. on the other hand, there's a good chance they're fitting an armour tank, meaning the damage type is very good, and it's got far higher dps than even faction emp. tell me again why people don't use it?"
"you might be a mwding minmatar ship but you're still not going to go more than 1k/sec in a none nano setup, any cruiser with a mwd will be able to outrun you. it's just not worth cutting your cap in half for a 30% dps increase when you can get the extreme falloff of barrage. especially when you're in a relatively slow ship."
"/signed"
"it really depends on what you are doing and what you are fighting. there is a lot of benefit to be had by changing ammos to a shorter range higher damage option. and there is only one mwding minnie ship that goes under 1kms, and it can fit 3 falloff rigs easily to hit 15km falloff. easily enough for most engagements[especially when a lot of targets like blaster ships will be wanting to come to you].hail isn't good for what we do, but neither are blasters of any sort and that doesn't mean both don't have a use."
"my ship fits have no tackle gear - they're gang-only. if you're in a gang where battleships don't tackle, that means you've probably got frigates that do. frigates can pretty easily outspeed fleeing cruisers and get the web on them, at which point your 1 km/s is plenty to catch up to them. and \"cutting your cap in half\" is a farce - the cap recharge on these ships while in combat comes almost entirely from the booster. the phoon gains 2.9 cap/s, the pest gains 3.6, and the mael gains 4.8 by switching from all hail to all rf emp. if you want to recharge naturally, you can dock up. failing that, carry rf emp - it's still good to have on hand - and switch out ammo when you actually care."

"i'm not sure to cry or laugh at the tempest and typhoon setups, the fact you think they're good and hence think the weapons are fine is frankly amazing. maelstrom setup is fine really but then you don't have much choice besides active tank 3 gyros and 8 guns.rcu and pdu on a typhoon? yes because this will offer so much more than another races ship that doesn't need so many fitting mods.shield tank pest with 2 cpus? why not just use a maelstrom with say an istab for a much better tank.mythical because its quite easy to open eft then copy the setup onto a forum, these actually used in game? wouldn't suprise me really the number of awful ship setups i've seen.the fact that a shield tank tempest is quite pointless is clearly besides the point...yes because having \"only\" 15km optimal with max damage ammo is awful (try having 3km) nevermind the option of taking a few seconds to switch to scorch and having 40 odd km range which more than makes up for a 200 odd m/s max mwd speed. no, they have limited damage switching. missiles have damage switching. tracking? you do realise a neutron t2 blaster is nearly identicle tracking to 800mm t2 ac so scratch off that less obvious advantage as none-existant.clearly the extra 0.8 damage (55.2 vs 56) is worth the 1.25x cap use increase, optimal penalty, falloff penalty and tracking penalty. you get more damage from cn am due to hit quality.tempest is a monster? i can sort of agree, it is a abomination which is a kind of monster."
"fyi those are some ****ing terrible setups.first phoon setup - no tackle, hail ammo lol, and pds with a ****ty armour tank? seen more competent fits come from bruce.pest: try tracking anything with those guns when you're moving, also, basic gyro? are you having a laugh? 2x co-proc? dear lord, son, learn how to compensate on cpu.mael: christ, again with the 800s. they're crap for normal usage, terrible tracking and again with a co-proc, wasting a low.if you're going to argue about ship balance, at least learn how to fit the things."

"instead of depleting existing minerals, which would make existing holders mad, why not have exploration like depletable deposits.idea: moon minerals exploration sites on spawned on moons on random basis. they stay until depleted. each spawn is say 14 to 30 day supply. this metal will be in addition to any other items on the moon. once found with probes, the minerals are extracted through regular pos operation. this would help fix the huge inflation of high end moon metals, and allow industrialist some of the exploration fun. not all exploration needs to be pew pew."
"even better than that (because it takes about 8 hours to put up or take down a pos worthy of defending dyspo) would be that all moons have their perminant stuff like they do now but can have one or more temporary ones. during downtime the server would populate x many random moons with one or more additional but temporary materials. if the moon has a temporary material on it allready then it is skipped. if it doesn't then it is given an aditional material that lasts until it's depleted. the amount of cycles it can be mined would be random but probably not an entire months worth. the method the server would choose for determining what aditional material to put on that moon is not in my realm of expertese.the idea here is to help avoid having only a small minority of players able to dominate the game to the extent that they simply can't be beat. the curent system alows a single type of income to be so highly valuable and protectable that controlling it allows it's owners to build wealth so much faster than any potential challengers. there is absolutely no balance in this. for example, i could make over a billion a week buying and selling transcranial microcontrollers from and to npc's... but only if i was the only one doing that. there is competition in that market and you simply can't keep other people from using the market. therefore it has a ballance. with megacyte you can guard all the systems that have megacyte in it's roids... but people get mega from grinding up loot and drone alloys so you can't really pinch that market too hard either. the bottom line:anything in an mmorpg that allows there to be a final victory (such as a resource that if totally controlled by a group grants them an unstopable advantage) effectively ends the game for everyone. there is no way that anyone else can win if a self-propetuating victory condition has been achieved."
"static and valuable resources promote the conquest of territory to capture those resources.dynamic and/or random resources promote people sitting on their butts and rolling the dice with what space they have. moving pos within their space when new opportunities arise.i am sure you can figure out which one is best for a game designed around internet spaceship combat. but just in case, ill tell you. its not the one that is proposed in the o.p."
"every time a gtc is sold it is imediatly applied to the buyers account. no gtc can be sold twice. in short, these players are gaining isk by paying for others to play."
"so? it is still buying isk with cash, and allows people who do not 'work hard' or even 'work' at all within the game to buy expensoive implants (or anything else).therefore, people with plenty of rl cash can buy plenty implants, which is completely contrary to your saying that high level implants would be a reward for those who 'work hard'."
"stefan said the implants should be sold by npc's, therefore it's an isk sink, when the money goes to an npc instead of a player. therefore, it's an isk sink. also, most people, who sit in stations are most likely traders (like me) and earn their money by trading not by gtc's. anyways - even though i'd love to have +6 or +7 implants (and i'd gladly pay 10-15b for a set) - it's still probably a little too much for most players in eve, veterans or not."
"listen. implants add less and less efficiency to learning as they go up--the difference between +4s and +5s is relatively small (about 8 hours or so for every four days depending on your base skills). so +6s and +7s, while making training faster, wouldn't give players using them as much of an edge as you'd think (besides, it takes about a month to get basic learning to 5 with decent starting attributes. why spend a billion isk on a month's worth of training?). and it would cause an extra isk sink. npc items take isk out of circulation while player items don't. even if someone bought +7s and then sold the character, the isk spent to pay for the character would be coming from isk already in circulation, while the isk used for the implants would have been removed from circulation. how is that not an isk sink?my only complaint with implementing this is that it would keep people with them from pvping. of course, if you have the isk to pay for a set of these, chances are good that you don't pvp anyway."
"i beleive the op meant to litearlly give new characters +6 and +7 implants. as veterans would be the only one able to afford them they would literally have to be given to new players who hope to catch up to older players."
"wrong.a. they are not an isk 'sink' unless they are destroyed, until then they've only been an investment.b. if you or others cannot see how +6 or +7 implants sold from npcs would affect the market for player sold +5 implants (or lower) then you are sorely misguided. it would ruin the market and value for them.c. you have absolutely no evidence at all that gtc sellers are the minority of welthy players. you are simply guessing. the fact is that isk can be bought with rl cash through gtc sales, which immediately grants such people an advantage in purchasing high-level implants (or other expensive items.)"
"only if players can make them. most implants should be craftable with the uncraftable being the named, just like modules.cannot support op."
"a. no. no, no, no. it would only be an isk sink if you bought it from an npc as the isk would go out of the game. it's an isk sink, when the isk goes out of the game. the liquid isk; it does not matter what you do with the item, since you cannot sell it back to an npc, therefore there is no isk faucet for it and you've already used up the isk. get it?b. i never said anything about the them not ruining the market, as well i didn't see you say anything about it. maybe they would ruin the market, maybe they wouldn't. what do you consider \"ruining\" the market anyways?c. true, i was simply guessing, still i was probably guessing right. yet, the gtc-sellers have an advantage nevertheless, therefore it's not a valid argument to forbid +6 or +7 implants from the game only due to gtc-sellers.anyways, if it wasn't clear from my previous post, i'm not supporting those higher level implants, i just wasn't against them either. therefore, i guess we're on the same side, owl algernon."
"i'm not going to argue semantics, as it's off topic. i perfectly understand what you are saying (which is correct), but i think my previous statement wasn't phrased well. regardless, the argument for introducing +6 and +7 implants into the game as an isk sink is utterly idiotic. if you want an isk sink then take all the current implants (or just +1s to +5s) and have npcs sell them. there's your isk sink. introducing +6s and +7s to do so is simply stupid.if you think they wouldn't ruin then market then you are delusional. regardless, as i stated above, have npcs sell +1s to +5s. otherwise, what you and others are too myopic to understand, is that the rich (gtc sellers, t2 builders, and those with more free time) will gain more skill points, while those casual players get screwed. see a pattern here? it's a horrible idea.probably guessing right? hahaha. prove it. you are again guessing by saying you are probably guessing right. stick to facts. fact - one can sell gtcs for isk which means one can buy high value in game items for real life money. so those with the inclination and then cash can buy +6 or +7 implants while others cannot. it's a moronic idea.introducing +6 or +7 implants hurts newer players and helps older ones. the skill point difference between newer and older players would only grow wider. if you can't see that fact then i'm not sure what to say.sure sounds like you're supporting them to me."
"first of, npc's are actually selling +1 to +5 implants, via the loyality point store (however it's called). therefore, +1 to +5 implants already are isk sinks. i'm not sure, why we even started arguing whether it is/should be an isk sink.again, i have to ask, what do you consider \"ruining\" the market? i would see the +6 and +7 implants as an addition not as a chance in the implants system. therefore, it shouldn't affect the market, at least not significantly. also, if they should affect the implant market greatly, it doesn't have to be for the worse. i mean, it can affect the market without ruining (whatever you mean by this) it.gtc-sellers can buy anything with rl money, so why does it sound moronic that they could buy +6 and +7 implants? i mean, they can buy a 70m sp char right away, which is, in my opinion, an even greater advantage. i would protest against gtc-sellers, if there was another way to play the game for free (yep, i've only payed 15 for all my time in eve).anyways, i won't reply anymore to this topic, as not to bring our discussion into a fight. at least you're considering others' arguments, which is good.good luck on protecting us against those almighty attribute enhancers!"
"completely and utterly wrong. you contradicted yourself in the same paragraph. they are not isk sinks because they are purchased with loyalty points. no isk leaves the game through players purchasing implants with loyalty points. i would think this statement would be self-evident.semantics, again. suffice to say that it's my personal opinion that few people would bother with +5 implants when +6 or +7 exist, unless the skill requirements for +6 or +7 are so heavy that +5s would remain useful for an extended period, in which case the usefulness of +6 or +7 would be seriously compromised. this is why +4 implants are so cheap now, they don't serve much of a purpose beccause the difference between training for +4s and +5s is negligible, and +5 are far more advantageous in the long run, which is precisely the kind of market that +6s or +7s would target."
"do you use the lp store? a +5 implant costs 65,000 lp and 65,000,000 isk. that's 65 million leaving the game per lp-bought +5 implant. and the reason +4s are \"so cheap\" is because they cost 12/65ths of what +5s cost - the isk/lp is almost identical."
"yes, i've used the lp store countless times. i'm aware of the isk cost. however, as you probably know, 65m isk to an npc is hardly much of an isk sink when compared to the billions the op has proposed.i've said it several times already, trying to rationalize introducing +6/+7 implants for the reason of creating an isk sink is indeed moronic, for all ccp would have to do is have npcs sell +1 through +5 implants directly from npcs to create the sink.the isk sink defense is inane. the implants aren't needed. and the problem they would create is simply that the skill point gap between newer/poorer players and wealthier/older players would widen."
"i was calling you on your comment that \"no isk leaves the game through players purchasing implants with loyalty points\", since clearly some isk does, just not as much as the isk-sink fetishists would like. i agree with you on +6 and up implants being crazy, though. the only change i'd like to see to learning implants is making +2 implants need cybernetics ii and +3 implants need cybernetics iii, and even that's just for flavour."
"i would love this."
"terrible idea..../not signed, for obvious reasons stated above."
"this. there will always be ships out of wack and people fervently trying to keep their i-win mobile. i only do small scale pvp and the falcon utterly screwbars everything about it. now i have to sit in one myself to counter other falcons and making the game utterly boring for those poor few gangs that didnt bring any of their own."
"basically it boils down to the fact, that while you can counter other cloaking recons using conventional (and very varied means), you're either bringing your own falcons (which have a ton of extra utility as well) or bringing very specific counter-fits which are totally useless (read: big liability to any small gang!) otherwise.a huge part of the issue is the range really (and relative ineffectiveness of eccm, particularly on non-bs ships), which makes counter-fitting not so effective (as you still get two to three (depending on race/sensor str) ships jammed out from the fight to one falcon even when counterfitting - not to mention losing a bunch of midslots alltogether which isn't that horrible).altogether, the best way to deal with one (for a small gang anyway) is to bring a falcon yourself (or a very specific counter-fit!). which wouldn't be a issue at all if it weren't for the covops cloak. nobody ever complains about the rook (which is de-facto obsolete, i almost never see them).the ease of use makes a lot of people simply use falcon alts."
"i think the fact that ecm is chance based is a factor here, i can be racially pumping out 14 points of jam per cycle, so say vs a bs, i have about a 60% chance of a jam with each ecm module. if someone gets ontop of me, by nano, or probing and warping, i die like a t1 cruiser. the problem jamming is that there is no garrentee. which is why its so powerful, so when it does work, its extremely effective."
"you should be pumping more out with racials actually.that's what jammers are for (and why you don't just unload all your jammers on a single target at a same time). even two ships (hac+ceptor) are most likely not going to kill a falcon.yeah. but statistically, it's extremely effective even though there are no actual guarantees it'll work. sure, sometimes you get unlucky jams on someone, but sometimes you jam 4 eccm-ed bs - which you in theory should never have.yes, jamming isn't 100% certain - which is good for you as eccm-ed ships would be incredibly hard to jam, and jamming would only happen if jam str added up. you effectively put more ships out of the battle this way, since throwing 15 points of jam on a 22 point ship is rather effective, particularly vs a slow locking ship - while it'd be totally useless if jamming wasn't chance based.however, statistically, you're doing a awesome job at reducing the effective enemy forces, much better then any other recon, and at ranges where classical setups cannot even target, and nanoships take their sweet time to arrive (while someone will be on that 50km away lachersis in a very short time, you only need to cross 22 km before you can point with a overheated disruptor).jamming not being chance based would be a definite ecm nerf - a eccm-ed bs (when heating) would require 3 racial jammers to have any effect (yes, effect would be total) and if doesn't have correct racials, sorry, mate, your two jammers aren'd doing anything at all. ever.right now, you'll jam a ceptor on a off jammer, imagine the fun if you couldn't possibly do that but, i'll always say it: none of this would be a issue if falcons didn't have a covops cloak."
"falcons are trivial to counter. i'm getting fed up of being killed or driven off by tacklers acting as warp-in points, by snipers, by eccmed nanohacs/nanorecons (arazus and lacheses in particular) so i'm considering returning to scorps - more ehp, similar jamming power and far cheaper, so i don't have to run away whenever something gets within 60 km of me."
"however, in small gang pvp you don't have designated anti-falcon boats at all times as a rule, and the covops cloak makes it really really nasty, because you can't scout for them to bring specific counters. which is why people are arguing: the covops cloak plus its capabilities in combination are the issue. particularly and specifically for small gang warfare.in bigger gangs, the covops cloak and the element of suprise doesn't have such a huge impact, as you will have enough extra tacklers and nanoships to take care of the threat."
"not supported!the damn ship can only do one thing well: jam. it doesnt do any damage, it doesn't tackle, it doesn't nano, it's not even a good scout...adapt and stop whining."
"the issue is that unlike a rook it can do two things well: jam and covops cloak. that's what the discussion is about.that said, we've adapted. we've got our own falcons. the issue isn't that we cannot adapt (we can and did), the issue is that the ship is a show-stopper for small gang pvp unless you have falcons of your own, or very specific counter-fits which are utterly wasted for other purposes in a small gang. you can't scout for a falcon so you know wether to bring them or not - while your scout should spot a scorp/rook/bb/kitsune and act accordingly, if he doesn't and you get suprise ********* then your scouting is bad.unlike any other cloaky recon, which you do not need special preparations to counter most of the time. it's the crux of the matter, and the reason why seeing rooks is very very rare."
"this just isn't true and you know it. bringing a sniper in a small gang is a specific counter of limited use elsewhere, i'll accept that. but inties, nanorecons (particularly arazu and lachesis) or hacs such as cerberus and nanoishtar are standard small gang ships and will very quickly remove that falcon from the field."
"so long as number 3 is a part of this agenda, this is an incredibly bad idea. you will only support this if you want to see the game become a **** hole."
"constructive criticism as always, i see."
"this is all very well kelsin and may have been a nice way to start out sovereingty claims at the beginning of eve but somehow i cant see your plans ever seeing the light of day.how would you, for example, compensate those alliances who have spent many a year and considerable amounts of isk on building up pos networks and stations in order to claim their own space?what bemuses me about your efforts here though is the fact that your corp/alliance's mission statement clearly tells us that you have no interest in holding or claiming space. so why the time spent telling those of us who do, how to do it better?if you were a space holding alliance putting forth these ideas then they would surely hold more water. but for an alliance who didnt have the caps necessary to remove sov from an enemy during a recent war your words are only akin to a baby flinging its toys from the pram when it doesnt get its own way.it is precisely this type of attempt from your alliance to force a very specific agenda that suits only yourself that irritates me. i do hope that the remainder of the csm delegates are able to withstand the constantwhining of the new chairman."
"posting in a star fraction sov-hater thread.sorry, i had to. now, to be serious.1) agree. capships online sucks.2) disagree. smaller gangs are not capable of causing the damage that a large fleet can cause; letting them do so would not be realistic. yes, you can harass or annoy a faction, but a bunch of people in dinghies with rocket launchers aren't likely to do any lasting damage compared to, say, the entire british royal navy. besides, there are already many advantages that small roaming gangs have in 0.0, just that gaining sovereignty isn't one of them.3) neutral towards the idea. disagree strongly with your proposal. capturable stargates encourage, no, demand gatecamps. people regularly complain about gatecamps as it is. anything that gives people a good, valid reason to gatecamp will quickly make 0.0 less safe than downtown baghdad on free firearm friday as people camp gate after gate to maintain or establish sovereignty. this also means that anyone jumping in is a potential sov threat, since they might see an unguarded gate and call in their friends. you'd need a nanoship or an interceptor just to get through the sheer volume of bubblecamps this proposal would generate."
"in all fairness a single submarine today could turn most of the eastern seaboard into a parking lot, but this is a game and we should just stick to make believe.i think it'd be keen to see small, well coordinated and tailored gangs be able to have some sort of harassment ability when it comes to pos structures. not to destroy them, not knocking them into 'reinforced' or whatever the term may be but rather into an 'offline' status. for example, ten stealth bombers decloak and unload their volley* into a research or manufacturing structure and warp out before the towers can get a lock. *perhaps a special type of cruise missile is called for... a 'shieldbreaker' of some kind, like in dune. slow moving and totally ineffectual against ships but can bypass pos shields no problem it's ballsy and it's got a great yarr quotient... staring down all those pos guns which are going to melt you instantly, sneaking into sov space... but it accomplishes sweet **** all. now, if said strike were to knock that structure into a 'offline' status for ten hours or so, you'd actually be able to conduct a viable 0.0 guerilla campaign that's a little more exciting than using t1 frigs to gank semi-afk miners and ratters."
"keep in mind that i'm suggesting multiple small gangs as an alternative to a single large one - not a single small gang instead of a single large one. the idea being you'd still need numbers to take and hold sovereignty, but you'd spread those numbers out across multiple systems/grids instead of having them all focus on one grid and strain the server. i guess my response to this is: isn't 0.0 supposed to be unsafe? secondly, the popular complaint about the current state of 0.0 sovereignty is that it's mostly empty space with the occasional massive fleet battle in which lag is a large factor. to take those massive battles and spread them out across space and time would ease lag issues and mitigate the ghost town feel of much of 0.0.the general principle is that the required military presence to hold sovereignty advantage in 0.0 should be less hot and cold (due to single timed reinforcement battles) and more a 'patrolled presence' style of control."
"as to offlining pos modules before the guns can target: what's to stop a group of bombers from doing this over, and over, and over, and over, ad nauseum, until the entire pos is offline? after all, if any opposition arrives, they can just cloak at a safe until the opposition leaves.as to 0.0 being unsafe: turning it into gatecamp-o-rama as your proposal suggests will make it not only very dangerous, but very dangerous in an annoying way. in other words, don't waste your time with anything not a nanogang, because it won't get through the bubblecamps of people maintaining their sov. combined with the other sf-championed proposals to remove local, destroyable outposts, and limiting map information, this would turn 0.0 from empire-building space into a giant free-for-all counterstrike-with-spaceships clusterf... well, you get the idea. kinda like fw testing on singularity without the free ships.i disagree with your idea of what 0.0 space is intended to be. i would like to see it more dynamic, yes, and i would like to see the larger alliances with massive holdings forced more into working to keep it, but i don't think 0.0 should be quite as dynamic as you do.disagree on principle i suppose."
"fair enough. but i'd suggest that there is a way to increase the dynamism of territory holding without adversely affecting the concept of empire building. the proposal i linked leaves the infrastructure building industrial pos side of things intact, but takes the territory-holding tools (jump bridges, cyno jammers plus new additions of gate-usage alarms) and grants those via a new more dynamic system based on sub-capital combat.i think it's fair to say that powerful tactical tools like the jump bridge should be based on an alliance's patrolling presence, rather than long term fixed constructs like the pos, which rely more on logistics and fueling than on active duty combat patrols, especially because the pos shield and reinforcement mechanic lead to massive battles at pre-determined times that necessarily involve capital ships. while it makes sense to have a pitched battle over a fixed structure, the concept of territory ownership is not based on the outcome of a single conflict, but on a consistent military presence and enforcement on borders and chokepoints.the idea that ownership of territory should be determined by having two massive armies meet on a battlefield and duke it out is a bit outdated, and that's what this seeks to resolve."
"the problem is it turns 0.0 spaceholding not so much into something you do in eve, but a 40-hour-per-week job that doesn't pay any money. not everyone wants to spend all their online time running patrols through empty space."
"but this problem is tweakable - you can have reinforcement-style timers (as the proposal i linked has) so that when a capture point is contested the defending alliance has a certain amount of time to reset their claim. if they fail to do so they lose control of the point. under the current system there are no patrols at all, but that doesn't mean the alternative is non-stop patrolling \"job-style\"."
"no, the popular complaints are1. pos warfare sucks when there isn't a fight2. there are no realistic goals for small gangs that matter3. pos are too difficult to put up and take down.for the most part people love big fleet fights. they don't like the lag, but they love the big fights.you can already do this, just attack a bunch of different pos at the same time."
"would you fools stop using that word. it means \"change\". combat dynamism doesn't ****ing mean anything. if you want to see \"dynamism\" in territory holding then get off your lazy butt and go take it, or go and destroy the towers or make it your own. as far as i can tell there has been plenty of dynamism in combat over the past year[and if you don't believe that, just ask triumvirate, ascn, lv, veritas, fix, smash, roadkill, and all the rest i can't remember].anything that \"increases dynamism\" must, by definition adversely effect the ability to empire build. the problem is not that capitals are valuable the problem is that there are no intermediary benefits for smaller gangs. fixing one does not mean scrapping the everything else in sov warfare.have you ever even taken down a jammer? they are outside the shields, you don't have to reinforce anything. same for bridges and generators. you want to take them down get off your butt and do it. if there is a problem with how difficult it is to do then say \"there is a problem with how difficult it is to do\" and don't say \"lets scrap the entire idea of fighting over sovereignty\"are you arguing based on realism now? seriously"
"poses currently grant industrial and sovereignty benefits to their owners. moving the sovereignty benefits to a different system doesn't mean the epic elements of pos warfare would go away. there could still be pos sieges and capship warfare - but to gain the jump bridge, cynojammer and some new abilities, alliances would instead engage in subcapital territory control.subcapitals engaging in territory security actions adds dynamism where constructing poses top gain territory fails to, and it provides subcapitals with objectives to maintain the security or overturn the security of a given territory, where pos sovereignty fails to."
"alliances will take part in whatever gives them the most benefit. that doesn't mean that its a good idea it means that alliances are rational actors. and holy lord stop using dynamism if you dont know what it means. if you want smaller gangs to have objectives then give them objectives don't remove the entire idea of taking space being a strategic game from the game."
"the word dynamic (and the made up noun-form i'm using here, dynamism) is very appropriate: the proposal to re-examine 0.0 sovereignty is in response to an overly static sovereignty system. to make it more dynamic without making it a ping-pong of major objectives, we need a broad array of smaller objectives that add up organically to create a larger effect.this is where a distributed-objectives mechanic can really shine. instead of a linear series of massive lag-inducing battles that is pos warfare, stargate warfare would be a parallel set of objectives fought on separate grids and in separate systems throughout a region, the results of which would add up to a cumulative effect."
"so you admit you are making up a definition for a word in order justify your argument?there are smaller objectives that add up to create a larger effect.1. economic suppression1. taking out jammers2. taking out bridges3. taking out economic pos.4. taking out sov holding posif there isn't enough you just make them easier and add more ability to take out economic structures.sov warfare isn't static. if you believe that you clearly haven't been paying attention to all the taken space and failed alliances. its been static on your front, but that has nothing to do with whether or not its static all around.1. its not linear as you are describing. i know ive been using that word, but a better one would be contiguous.2. parallel objectives are ******ed. it promotes blobbing[as you attempt to capture 2 objectives i blob each in order to defend them] and and removes all strategic decision making since all gates are equally valuable."
"i agree with this topic, sovereignty system needs reexamination. another problem with sov is that 0.0 alliances usually claim far more space then they actually use, and newcomers to 0.0 do not really have a chance to take on them, with the reinforced timers and the fast capital deployment possible in eve. i think some game mechanic change penalizing the claiming of space that is not actually being used by the claimer would do good to the game."
"yep i'm happy to support it."
"crap, thumbs down, battleships are less prolific and have about as many uses as noobships"
"this. i think he meant: let us travel for free,use csm to our personal agendas and after we have done it all judge us on results."

"ok my opiniion about the topic:* a titan is a 50b-150b asset depending on fittings and manufacturing costs so making it 3x-6x more expensive then a mothership and 250x-750x more expensive then a fitted tier2 battleship. therefor i think it's only fair that it is nearly impossible to kill.* yes it is true that only rich well established alliances can get their hands on 1 or more and therefor making them even harder to defeat and thus inbalancing the game. but like in every mmorpg, the best and most difficult things to obtain are not for poorly organized clans-guilds-corporations or for casual players, but for the best of the best and thus making them even better.* ofcourse there always should be an opening for the underdog to win and thefefor i think introducing an only carriermodule to tackle capitalships could be the answer for bringing balance and giving the underdogs the chance to destroy supercapitals. ofcourse this again should be outbalanced ofcourse by increasing the damage multiplier on titans for capital gun turrets as it can never be the intention for a carrier to solo kill a titan. so bottom line give them the chance to tackle until help is there or die trying to keep it tackled long enough.* titans combined with sov 4 combined with cynojammer is in my opinion a bit overkill. but i think it can be solved by either not allowing titans in systems with a cynojammer or only making pos structures inside the pos shield indestructible.ps: i have no experience with capital fights or titans so i base my personal opinion on information and post i read."

"after thinking about it for a bit, i dont think the nidhoggur changes will change it to be a better shield tank than armor tank. it will however give it better cap regen, the nidhoggur doesn't really need as big a boost than the naglfar and without significant changes to cap recharges / cprs vs. pds it probably wont ever be shield tanked."
"the naglfar does more damage than any of the other dreads at an effective pos siege range (all the others only have 4 high slots, 3 for weapons, the naglfar has 5 high slots, for 4 weapons.). you are forgetting that the naglfar can fit close range weapons and still be effective, while blasters and pulses tend to come in under the range required to be effective in a pos siege and useless unless you are ontop of enemy capitals in a capital fight.if you were to balance it to require just guns, you would need to remove a high slot like all the other dreads, then you could give double damage bonuses instead of the current split bonuses. there is a danger of making all the dreads too generic though, i did like the flavour the split system gave. the phoenix does the lowest damage, but it is forgiving of range. the moros does excellent drone damage, but it can't use blasters effectively in most situations, it also has a weaker tank than the revelation. the revelation is probably the best dread out there for sieges, not requiring you to keep pressing fire, having a good range and tanking well. the nidhoggur is already arguably the best carrier out there for the usual remote repping circlejerk setups that you see these days, giving it an extra mid would be unbalanced, it had one removed to give it an extra low. i personally think this was a mistake, given that there are already two armor tanking carriers, and this as you point out means training another skillset, although being minmatar you should probably be used to this. faster regen on the nidhoggur also suits its role as the best remote repping carrier out there, being as the cap trick doesn't really work on capital ships, it will easily out rep the other carriers, the thanatos's damage bonus isn't hugely significant anymore (in days of assigned fighters from behind pos shields it was). with the change to an armor tank, the cpu isn't really an issue, as it isn't on the archon or thanatos. all capital ships need more cpu, especially the ones that shield tank you need fitting mods on the phoenix/chimera still also, which for a capital ship is ridiculous. grid as far as i'm aware is a total non issue, i've never seen anyone run out of grid on any potential capital ship fit."

"just a quick question.the op states that the nag needs to use 4 damage mods to compete with the other dreadshow can this be when the nag starts with 33% more firepower than other dreads due to 4 weapons instead of 3 ?assuming tech ii modules.with todays stacking penalties 3 bcu on a phoenix would only give a total damage modifier of 1.573 weapons * 1.57 = 4.71compared to a nagflar with 1 bcu and 1 gyro4 weapons * 1.2 = 4.8so now you 2 extra slots for tanking whether you go shield or armor i dont know.but do you still say the nag needs love ?."

"yes please.(capitals in total need a revamp - tanking is too important to give one race the uber-tanks and the rest some nice little bonuses - but that should be a different topic; right now, the only reason to train for minmatar capitals is that they look awesome. which is cool, but a bit more game balance would be nice :-))"
"this."
"plug it into eft and take a look. there are two glaring problems with the nags split weapon bonus. first, every other dread has two bonuses for it's gun type, the nag has to one ship bonus for each of it's weapon type. now take any of the other dreads, if they fit 2 damage mods those damage mods apply to all 3 of thier weapons. the nag fits two damage and it either only applies to 2 of it's weapons, or each weapon only gets 1 damage mod. to get the same effect as 2 damage mods on all of it's weapons, it needs to fit 4 damage mods (2 for each weapon).also the relatively low dps of both projectile weapons and capital torps doesn't help the nag's dps."
"there's a lot of misconceptions here that are pretty common with people who don't actually know what they're talking about. first off, just because the naglfar has 4 turret slots doesn't mean for half a second it does more damage than any of the other dreads thanks to the reasons i mentioned in the post before this one (mainly that projectile and torp damage is low in comparison to beams / rails + crazy drone bonuses). people will never fit auto cannons on a nag because if for whatever reason you have to shoot things further away (say pos mods, or getting hot dropped) you'll be completely screwed. you could fit pulses on the revelation and get just as long range, but you'd be in the same boat. it's much better to fit long range guns and use short range ammo, switching to longer range ammo if needed. at this point, i'd be very happy with double weapon bonuses for both weapons (just take on rof and damage mod instead of just one).secondly, before the nidhoggur change the nidhoggur was the absolute worst carrier by far. it had a terrible shield tank and because pds suck vs. cap rechargers for cap it had terrible capacitor. in order to correct this you'd probably need to take away a low slot and add two medium slots (basically taking the previous change in the other direction) and adding a large capacitor buff to the nidhoggur. people would probably just armor tank it and use the insane mid slots for even more insane cap regen though. oh, and you can still assign fighters and sit in poses you just nudge outside the shields, assign fighters, and go back inside. the naglfar is the only capital to require fitting mods. chimera and phoenixes use pds for cap regen, not fitting."
"minmatar capitals need some love."
"i dont have access to eft atm can you put up the dps numbers for the ranged ship setups your talking about pleaserail moros v beam rev v citadel phoenix v ( arty/citadel ) nagcant help but feel that your underestimating the influence of the 4th capital weapon this is 33% more highslot resourse than available to other dreads which compensate via better use of damage mods."

"thanks, i'm stuck at work without eft also but iirc with 4 (2x gyro, 2x bcu) faction damage mods and all other dreads having 2 faction damage mods the phoenix had ~3900 dps, the nag ~4100 dps, the moros ~4800 dps, and the rev ~4900 dps (this might have been with faction ammo too). of course the phoenix had something close to 80k alpha (and the other dreads around 20k). this is with the nag having twice the number of damage mods as other ships, it just doesn't make sense. also iirc the effective hp of the dreads is: nag about 1-1.3mil, the pheonix 2mil+, the revelation and the moros 1.8-2mil.i'm not estimating anything anyway, i wrote this after looking around at tower killmails / eft. oh, did i mention that extra fourth turret also means you use 133% ammo too (in comparison to the moros / phoenix)? that's great when your cargohold is full up of stront / fuel / ammo."
"now, now!the phoenix uses 25.8 m3 of ammo per siege cycle, the naglfar 42.2 m3, and the moros 57 m3 per siege cycle (my fit above, emp/am ammo). and the naglfar has the largest cargo hold of them all! it's not the worst everywhere. of course, if you look at the ammo cost of a single siege cycle, the naglfar shines again: 242,088.26 isk! the siege cycle of the phoenix costs 228,996.50 isk, while the economical moros only needs 215,503.32 isk!(no, this is not a serious balancing post.)"
"just a note. i didn't do the exact calculations (just rough ones), but it seems that when shooting a minmatar control tower with no shield hardener arrays, this roughly balances out again. (once you start fitting hardener arrays, it approaches the above values again)the point for me here is that the naglfar is not, in itself, completely inferior to the other dreads. in competent hands, it's slightly worse, but not completely outclassed. the main problem is that you need to train multiple weapon systems to achieve the same effect as with other dreads."

"just not true. with equivalent skills once you can get into a covetor it beats even a rokh at mining. granted the rokh fits a much stiffer tank but just ore m3 wise even the great rokh best of the mining bs loses (since the mlu nerf).domi is second and normally preferred for the drone bay. domis can defend themselves. rokhs just have to take the beating."
"you can not compare bs to mining barges because they are built for different mission roles. yea you will have a better out put with a bs with ****ty mining skills then a procurer with ****ty mining skills. once your skills improve each ships use improves also. you need the procure so you will know how to operate its tech ii version and if you think the skiff sucks then once again you are not using it for its intended mission. same stupid comparison is made that you will make more money doing missions then mining.....and yes you will once your at a high enough skill and mission level. once again however both serve different roles."
"i do mining as more of a secondary profesion so although i have a good hulk skillset i also have top drone skills, gal bs v, and lots of miner upgrades fitted. i'm able to tank and kill the bs rats for my covetor buddy with his t2 strippers but i was also putting more ore in the can inbetween spawns. perhaps he was slacking or something but my point is that if a ship doesn't fit your needs you don't use that ship. right? you don't need to petition every variable of the game that doesn't work acceptably for your circumstances. you train and save and research and discover the equipment and techniques that are allready there so you can do the best at what you want to do. the procurer can probably mine ice more efficiently than a hulk btw... assuming the belt is under attack from the dreaded jihadswarm, the hulk will be the target and the proc will probably survive. if it does die it will be such an insignificant loss compaired to the hulk (ice hulks fit expander rigs so they can mine for about 30 min without having to dump, making them really expensive) that the proc pilot has still successfully mined ice more efficiently than the hulk pilot. there, i've given the procurer a strong buff. king me."
"that's the issue - it's not that the procurer doesn't fit his play style, it's that it doesn't fit anybody's play style. it's a dedicated mining ship that mines worse than a cruiser, and not even a mining cruiser(a thorax outmines it by 72%, for example). the only conceivable reason to buy a procurer is to increase your chances of getting a skiff bpc. no, you've come up with a flimsy excuse about how, since the ship is too pathetic for even goons to want to kill it, it's better. real feat of deductive reasoning, there. i really hope you're sarcastic/trolling..."
"its useless because its supposed to be useless...its a t1 mining cruiser, that takes very little to train for...therefore, you get very little in return. if you're whining because you want to use one, take the extra 3 hours and get a retriever."
"there's a second good use for the ship. i may use a bit of sarcasm at times to help bring my point across but i'm really quite serious when it comes to game changes. my main gripe and reason for replying is that the op doesn't recognize the usefullness of this ship. instead of finding a use for this ship or selecting another one more suitable for his intended use he is demanding that the ship be changed to be inline with his assumed needs. as a matter of fact, the ice mining quip is based on a true story. a guy in my corp has an alt that mines ice in a procurer. he did it because goons were killing mackanaws, hulks, and covetors on sight. he can use a hulk and iceminers at lvl v but he chose the proc. he would anounce when other ships in the belt were getting ganked but he didn't get ganked. having a procurer mining ice means both that you're not afk for a long time so you see when bad things are happening, and you're the least desireable target so you have plenty of time to flee before it's your turn to die. in comparison to that, i got another acount and trained it from scratch to mine ice. i got that charactor a cargo-rigged hulk and subsequently was suicide ganked in an ice belt. after months of training, a few hundred million in inplants, skills, ship, rigs, modules, and 2 weeks of mining ice for the entire duration i was awake... i lost my ship and retrained my alt to do other stuff. he ended up mining more ice than me and never lost his ship. that's nobodies fault but my own but it proves my point. i should have found the right ship for the job. the wisdom i've gained from that experience i'd like to shair with you and the op.sorry for sounding like a sarcastic troll earlier. i often come across that way but i generally don't commit to typing something unless i feel i've got something important to say... even if i can't word it right all in one post :p"
"would like to point out that i have no particular need for a procurer, having been able to fly a hulk for longer than i've been able to fly a battleship. i'm simply pointing out that there is no use for it - it's totally, completely, thoroughly useless for everything except skiff invention.i challenge anyone to find a legitimate, everyday use for this ship. i'm not interested in wild situationals, just in things you might actually consider buying this ship for."
"my bad - i heard jihadswarm was killing all ore ships, not just the 3 most common. in that case, his decision does make some sense, though it'd still make more sense to use a retriever instead. that said, what they've done with exhumers is a good idea of what i think barges should look like. each of them has a clearly defined role, and is fairly good at it. now, i'm not suggesting that ice and mercoxit are what the procurer and retreiver should be doing, but what if the smaller barges had bigger tanks and holds? give people some actual choice - coveter is still best for isk/hour, but the others are easier to use. there's probably a better idea to be had, but that's a start, imo."
"its like trying to find a really good use for the 50k and less frigates. they are very very cheap and if someone is going straight to barges and can't afford a retriever yet it gives them something to mine with in the mean time."

"minmatar needs a comprehensive exmaination as they have ruined the battleships.the only reason to fly a minmatar battleship was alpha strike. they are fragile and their speed advantage over a sniperthron is negligible. rigs and doomsday proof cruiser fits have meant that alphastrike is no longer the arbiter of fights but dps.the end result of all this was the half baked abortion; the maelstrom. an active tanking fleet battleship with half a gun's improvement in damage and is a whale to get out of a fight. what a stroke of game designing genius that was.my point. minmatar 1400's need to be restored to their place of prominence quickly or the entire line of minnie bs needs a drastic overhaul. the problem is that there is no chance of the this happening as the clueless game designers have no interest in doing this. they want close range fights where lag is maximised, minnie ships are useless and have only one possible way of surviving; nanoships.by all means ask; but please do not expect anything from ccp. they know best............."

"i'll repost the ideas i put into a similar thread in c&p earlier. insurance isn't so much the issue as much as there is no punishment to fit the crime. the 4 main empires, the most powerful known governing bodies in new eden (excluding the jove of course) would be less lenient about this i would imagine, so if people want to be outlaws and pirates, why not let the empires treat them as one.the following would apply to any acts of piracy in high sec empire space:1. impounding of ships and goods stored in empire stations until a hefty fine is paid.2. seizure of bank personal bank funds.3. no admittance to empire stations.4. no admittance to empire jump gates.5. removal and destruction of clones in empire clone bays.6. offending characters actions effect their corp standings and open the possibility of siezure of corp assets in empire space. these seem a bit extreme, but it would open up business opportunities for corps that own pos's and outposts, as well as pc run banking outfits. there are ways around it still, but it would make it a lot less appealing. /signed either way"
"this suggestion is a veiled attempt to removing it all together. and that wont happen as you know. it does not balance the risk award factor. the balance factor is slowly coming about but this kind of over aggressive stance does not contribute to anything really. no there has to be something else. we have to be able to give the haulers, miners more options to fit there ships better to give them a chance. give them better tools to help them to fend for them selves and make it harder for the suicide gankers to succeed. as far as ratters/mission runners that is another issue. they have to think beyond the the mission and fit them selves for a possible attack against gankers yet still allowing them to finish there mission. maybe make them harder to find due to some kind of interference to spacial anomaly. making the aggressor to work harder or have better skills and equipment to to be able to get a better chance of finding the target.we have to find a balance between the two. one extreme or another does not solve anything."
"the problem is not mission runners found in a mission (you can actually protect against that somewhat by eying local and scanning for probes), but mission runners jumping through a gate. now if ccp changed every mission to spawn in the agents system, this would be a perfectly fine fix too. but i have the underlying feeling that ccp enjoys subjecting mission runners to stupid idle time sinks like jumping to other systems or traveling 70km to the next gate in a mission where it takes a velator 20 secs to kill all enemies, so i don't see that happening."
"thumbs down goes here"
"its not a veiled attempt at anything. it is a solution in line with standard and fairly universal methods of curbing crime. it removes nothing but instead adds to the challenge. eve thus far is a game that caters more to piracy than to those that wish to peacefully co exist with other players and build and mine and sell....the people that make up the core of new eden's economy. capsuleers are valuable assets to the empires, as well as costly investments, why wouldn't they protect those assets from pirates in their own sovereign space? i have no probelm with piracy in the game, but with crime should come consequence."
"i also disagree with this idea. as somone who has played in the market a lot i've learned that pricing competition is part of the game. if you don't like the competition you are getting then either massivly under cut your competition or find a market that is not so competitive."

"no they will all move to the .5 sec agents need to change the way sec status factors into lp payout as well."
"this is partly true. ccp not always can be bothered to fix bugs. in fact a lot of the minor or even insignificant bugs aren't fixed since beta.part of the problems that occur is that ccp releases a new patch way too soon and it causes tons of problems and taking up several months to fix the biggest holes. you can blame marketing, you can blame qa but i think you have to blame the top brass for this since they give the ok.one thing csm can do is ask ccp to have the volunteer bughunters team replace by ccp paid professional bughunters. these people are more efficient, precise and are educated for this line of work. they also can give faster feedback to devs (read: kick their behinds) if needed.this can shorten the time it takes to identify bugs pre and post release of a new patch. they also can ask ccp if they can fix all the smaller stuff that's been broken for years now. (eg. typos in descriptions, pos, industry related stuff etc etc)"
"would you care to explain why you believe it is \"totally out of order\" (with gameplay) please pezzle?"
"easy enough.implementing destructible outposts with the current state of cap ships online would lead to outpost griefing. other groups have said as much already. (cap ships being a different issue that also impacts gang and fleet combats).an alteration of sov mechanics might well make for more engaging fleet combats. the effects of those changes might also see space change hands more readily, ending what some see as absurd deadlocks. (sov issue impacting gang and fleet combat, logistics, general deployment, super alliance and so on). finally i believe outpost disabling should actually add new options to the game rather than remove them. outpost on/off does no justice to the complex possibilities of eve."
"well people \"say\" a lot pezzle, but surely its not sensible to balance eve territorial game-play on the boasts of particular alliances and individuals. specifically to the example proposal i make in the op - it doesn't become any easier to take these outposts than it is in the existing system and you are simply allowing an aggressor to inflict damage on the enemy rather than using the conquests for ongoing income (as happens now). thats really another topic and doesn't have a bearing on the discussion of the feasibility of outpost destruction i think. remember pezzle, this isn't a vote on \"making outposts destructible in one foul swoorp\" - this is a question about whether it is fair to ask ccp if they see feasibility for the introduction of destructible outposts in the 0.0 game in the future.i have to disagree with you there. the self-destruct mechanic and dramatic bids for control/rescue and the tragedy of exploded outposts and ongoing derelicts for people to salvage their stuff from! thats many new options for the game right there."
"as things stand, larger alliances can invade a smaller rival's territory, but once the reach a certain point they struggle to hold on ot it. if you allow outposts to be destroyed, you'll see the larger alliances stamp on their smaller rivals and destroy their outposts before withdrawing.this will mean that the large established alliances become even more entrenched than they are now and that small up and coming alliances won't be given the chance to grow.that's why destructible outposts are a bad idea."
"well rodj, at the moment a handful of mega-alliances hold the majority of 0.0 space. that suggests they aren't exactly struggling to hold space. and we'll see smaller rivals striking back on multiple fronts and burning the territory of the larger powers while they are involved elsewhere. its sauce for the goose. i don't believe its actually possible for the large established alliances to become any more entrenched than they are at this moment rodj. the game has reached a nadir of dynamism in 0.0 right now. i believe the time has come for the training-wheels to come off 0.0 and the space-holders should be expected to seriously protect their holdings once again. well ultimately lets ask ccp what they think."
"i very much would like to see the ability to destroy outposts, but there are big problems with this. if you use the same or similar mechanics to pos warfare it favors larger alliances.convince me that it's possible to develop a mechanic that allows the destruction of outposts that doesn't favor larger alliances over smaller ones, and you'll have my support."
"[jade says stuff i am not quoting because pyramids bother me] here is my response:game balance must consider both ends of the spectrum jade, not a single viewpoint. it is irrelevant, for purpose of discussion, that groups have not gone on a tirade of outpost destruction. it being possible means that the impact must be considered. the same considerations should have taken place with the introduction of cap ships or any new game mechanics. if we push something to the extreme, what happens to the game? is that something acceptable or even wanted?moving your loot out of a derelict outposts can be made to sound exciting if you dress it up with the right nouns and adjectives, but reality is players will use alts or friends in the area to do it, sell the items or simply write it off for the time (which is what happens now when an outpost is lost). hence no real change. there needs to be more. unexpected and bizarre results would attract more attention and generate more interest, even from those outside the immediate conflict. because i do not believe your proposal includes anything more dynamic i choose against it.finally, you brought up the topic and asked if it was fair to consider now. i have said no and in my response touched on just a few of the reasons as an example so others can understand my objection. there is only so much time and some issues are more important than others. i believe that other topics are more important at this moment. what i have stated absolutely has a bearing on this subject. please do not try and dismiss my saying no as somehow 'off topic'. other issues do influence outposts and any change in their nature. if pointing that out now brings realization to some that we are getting ahead of ourselves so much the better."
"we need more stations in 0.0, not less... there are large expanses of unused space out there, controlled by large alliances while at the same time being considered worthless.add a few outposts, and the scale will tip slightly. they might still be willing to expend the effort of defending and maintaining that rather worthless piece of 0.0. yet at some point, with too many stations to hold the scale will tip far enough for them to ignore a smaller alliance moving in.people live in deserts... we just need an oasis."
"jade,thank you for the response. the reason i asked was that it appears you posted a change (make stations partially destructible), then cited the reasons for the change. i feel this is putting the cart before the horse. i feel the csm should focus on determining what the big issues are, (e.g. lag, sov, getting more people into low sec, etc.) not (necessarily) proposing particular solutions.thus, i feel there are two issues in this thread: 1. the risk / reward ratio is out of balance in 0.0 (too little risk). 2. everything player built in 0.0 should be destructible. if one, none, or both of these are voted as issues then the csm could post a thread requesting solutions. from what i see in the above comments and votes, people (for the most part) are arguing about the fix, not whether they feel the rewards are too big for the risks in 0.0 and whether in 0.0 everything should be destructible (or partially destructible). i guess im asking the csm reps to id the issues, then ask for solutions (at which point they can propose a solution, of course). others-wise, i fear the csm will spend a lot of time discussing solutions, not whether something is a critical issue to game play."
"no, a handful of mega-alliances have to sell off space in order to keep it friendly because they are too over-extended to hold it all.if you make this change they will be able to destroy the space rather than hold it. reducing further population density and the ability of hostile organizations to move on their resources.e.g. currently we are taking geminate from smash/rk/atlas. now, we are faced with a problem \"wtf are we going to do with all this space we don't want\". if we could blow up the stations we would. then no one gets to use the valuable space without putting up another station that we can blow up.no you won't because those fronts won't be there. they will be destroyed by the mega alliances as buffer zones to prevent serious staging of war. jade, it is not possible for there to be a limit on the ability of large established alliances to become more entrenched until one alliance holds all space. furthermore, any suggestion that pushes further entrenchment cannot reduce that entrenchment. its like giving tax cuts to the wealthy and then wondering why the gap between rich and poor increases.there are no training wheels in 0.0. you get shot and you lose your space and all the work that went into taking and holding it. the only training wheels exist for corps that sit in high sec and complain about how static 0.0 is without doing anything about it.no, that is not what the csm is for. the csm is here to discuss ideas and determine whether or not they are valuable to be brought to ccp. to refine the good ideas so that ccp sees a the benefits, concerns, and expectations for new features and to weed out the ideas that despite sounding good when someone blows sunshine up your ass, would be bad for the game.this is an idea that would be had for the game. and unless you want to see goonswarm being more powerful and you being even more impotent about it you will not bring this issue to vote or vote against it."
"i quote the above simply to make a point. this is pure griefing, if an alliance has no intension of holding the space they are taking over then why bother attacking it in the first place.alliances usually only take space for a handful of reasons, two of which are:-1) they want the space to begin with.2) the enemy is too close to their space they want to keep so they take an outpost hoping to force the enemy back.if you have a truly nomadic alliance and out just out to destroy outposts or remove alliances from 0.0 space then you would not care of be interested in holding the space anyway. the fact you remove an alliance from space, but left the assets behind only gives you a reason to come back 6 months later to do it again. if you have enjoyment in that type of power play, then you wouldn't opt to destroy the outposts because it removes that opportunity to do it again.outpost destruction is a nice tactic but really needs to be justified other then \"ha ha we destroyed your stuff.\"i would support the following iteration of the idea.if an alliance owned all the outposts in a region, they can not destroy their own outpost, and no alliance can destroy any outpost in that region just because they have the firepower to do so.however, if another alliance came along and took an outpost in that region, both the original alliance and the \"agressive\" alliance have the ability to destroy each others outpost/s. however eventually it would come down to one outpost left in which would be invulnerable to attack, because it's the only outpost in the region therefor there is no contestation.the idea here is to leave the legacy and make agressive alliances accountable for their destruction. if they totally remove all other outposts from the region and are left with one, then say \"we don't want this and leave\" it makes that part of space at least somewhat attractive to someone.a totally outpost-less region of 0.0 space is not as desirable as one that has at least one outpost, even to new alliance looking for a place to \"live\".speaking for someone who has actually lived in geminate i can say if there was a way to destroy all outposts geminate would be abandoned for a very long time. the region itself is incredibly poor in terms of moons etc. the only value it has is the fact you can get to and from jita in under 15 jumps."
"and i am not seeing why anyone would not destroy the stations forcing anyone who wanted the space to spend billions and billions of isk again making it livable. so that when the destroyers came back they get to blow up the outposts again, creating an even larger financial burden on the enemy.not sure what to say about the rest of it."
"you guys are thinking of alliances as single entities, like giant ogres, and are arguing that it's unfair or stagnant that single entities should hold so much space, or what not. but the truth is that an alliance is a swarm of players, and its numbers that hold the space, not a single entity.a lot of the scenarios predicted here, about what would happen between \"big\" alliances and \"small\" alliances don't make much sense when you're talking about swarms of players. seriously, as an exercise, replace the word \"alliance\" with \"1500 players\" (or an accurate number) throughout this discussion, and see if your arguments still make sense.cause, for example, it seems to me that 800 players (the alliance) are perfectly capable of crushing multiple attacks by 50-man gangs (small rivals), while 700 players (the other half of the alliance) are \"involved elsewhere.\""
"the issue is see with this is assets. as many 0.0 corporations/alliances and individuals keep hundreds of billions of assets inside stations. if a station is taken over, the assets are still there so there is some hope of getting them back. by having the outpost as destroyable you remove this hope that maybe someday, the assets will be recovered.there are 2 ways around this. interbus - has exclusive access to remove all character and corporation owned assets and puts them in the corporation hq station. the other option would be have the station out there as a dockable station wreak or something you can interact with to recover your own assets.that is really the only issues i can forsee, station owners should beable to self-destruct them - with a timer of about 2 days (at downtime they blow)and should require at least sov1."
"this is the resolution i prefer, basically having a derelict wreck that people can move close too and access their stuff from."
"if the stuff isn't destroyed and accessible then why blow up the station?"
"stations cost money. upgrading stations costs money. the point is inflicting loss on the owning alliance and ensuring that afk defense is no longer possible on the alliance territorial scale. destroying a fully upgraded outpost can cost the owning alliance a lot of isk, and you can bet that the alliances investing in full upgrades will be the richest alliances not the poorest. something you need to realize goumindong, is i want to make eve harder for alliances, not individuals. i want to increase the risk of alliance loss in 0.0 space, but i don't want to see jonny alliance ratter 101 bankrupted out of the game to no good fault of his own.increasing the territorial forfeit penalty for over-extended alliances is a targeted measure designed to restore risk and reward balance on the alliance level."
"afk defense is already not possible. why would it change if you gave alliances the ability to destroy stations? it would be even easier to defend space since players wouldn't be able to assault jump off points.if you don't believe me, why don't you take some space and then afk defend it. i guarantee you, you will not hold your space long.there is no need to patronize me. i am perfectly aware of what you want to do.but what you are doing is increasing the risk of small alliance loss and not increasing the loss of large alliances. these over extended alliances don't exist. they sell the space or they lose it.here is a good example. gs overextends into delve. now, were we able to destroy stations we would have popped 49- and qy6. this would have cost bob a lot, but bob was not over extended into those areas, we were. cost to the overextended? zero(****, we would have saved money). cost to the defenders? everything.end result: large alliances consolidate and everyone else gets ****ed.ed: not to mention that alliance risk is personal risk. stations don't get built out of magic isk that comes from magic land. it comes from people putting up the cash to get it done. it comes from people flying ships into stations to build and maintain pos chains. it comes from the people in the alliance."
"i take it back, this would be a whole new world in alliance level grieving.oh you dropped a few stations in <random worthless system>? haha not anymore suckas."
"i support this so long as we are allowed to blow up ds1's stations and force them into a nomadic, mad-max lifestyle."
"everything should be explodable!"
"i support this idea because it would make it possible for goonswarm to destroy stations currently held by smaller alliances. :twisted:"
"goumindong is right. it allows you to have a significant impact on another person's infrastructure without deploying similar infrastructure yourself. you could just roll in, blow up the outpost, and roll out with no actual risk taken yourself.an outpost is a double edged sword. yes, it gives you a secure base in deep space, but it's also a vulnerable point. you can lose it just as easily as you've gained it. the same goes for the agressors - they might take it, but now they've got a 20b isk asset to defend. the ability to \"take\" that asset without risking it yourself would give waaay too much of an advantage to nomadic \"powers\".eve does not need fewer static combat points, it needs more. since the removal of complexes all there has been for this is high end moons and outpost systems. there need to be more strategic objectives to take and hold - fw, for example, is something that could be implemented on a grander scale in 0.0."
"actually if you just stiffened the rules regarding how often you can put up strategic pos modules and then made those modules easier to attack as well as making economic pos modules easier to attack then you can fulfill those strategic objectives without a major change to pos warfare while giving smaller gangs reasons to go do things.you won't even need to implement fw type system[which is pretty flawed imo] in order to get that benefit."
"i think the simple principle here is that nothing belonging to a player or group of players should be indestructible, besides big explosions are always good tt"
"that's just it, \"forcing anyone who wanted to the space to spend billions\" if you truly enjoy destroying alliances worthy of fighting then you should leave the outposts where they are, and just abandon them.unless you're objective is to just pwn every single alliance with a pos in 0.0 and not give anyone the opportunity to establish themselves, even a little. from a griefers perspective you want to give them an opportunity to come out.as an alliance if i know a mega alliance is roaming 0.0 bbqing outposts and destroying assets just because they can without rhyme or reason, then why would i want to even begin to dump billions of isk into a system.you would be totally destroying small or medium alliance opportunities to go out to 0.0, ergo removing your \"fun\" because you'd have nothing but alliances of equal or greater \"power\" then your own.how fun would that be, roaming 0.0 looking for poses and outposts to destroy and only coming across empty space because the threat of losing an outpost if simply too much to swallow for anyone new.now as an industrialist, i want the outposts destroyed, there needs to be some big major isk sinks in this game and this would be a great one. however i can also see the difference between a band-aid over the issue and a long term solution.yes, destroyable outposts would be great, no, the ability to totally wipe every outpost out of every region is not. that is why i like my idea of only destructible if the region is contested by multiple alliances.no alliance should be able to be allowed to roll up at 5 hours before downtime without warning and totally bbq an outpost with 500 capital ships. there needs to be a set formula for destruction.alliance a owns all the outposts in a region.alliance b wants to destroy alliance a.alliance b has two options. 1) deploy their own outpost. 2) take over one of the existing outpostsalliance b can now destroy all of alliance a's outposts.it would be crazy stupid for ccp to allow a massive blob the ability to just roll around from system to system destroying outposts without that alliance committing to the fight by bringing their own outpost or taking the time to take an outpost first.both alliances must have the same set of objectives1) defend your poses2) defend your outposts3) defend your fleets4) attack your enemy fleets5) attack your enemy poses6) attack your enemy outpostsunder the scenario suggested, and more importantly suggested by a particular alliancealliance a's objectives are1) defend their poses2) defend their outposts3) defend their fleets4) attack the enemy fleetsalliance b's objectives are1) attack the enemy poses2) attack the enemy outposts3) attack the enemy fleets4) defend their fleetsthis is not acceptable since alliance a's defend objectives are static, and their attack objectives are movable. whereas alliance b's are the exact opposite. alliance b would have a massive advantage.they are two different objectives, each obtainable in very different ways. for something as major as total alliance destruction the objectives of both alliance a and alliance b must be the same."
"havent' really thought about whether it should be changed really... i just know that i don't like having to remember a set of variables for each ammo type i load and i don't use it. i go for the faction stuff because i can just buy it from the station without having to find some jerk that builds it or get it transported to me like it is with the t2. it hits as good and i don't have to think about added penalties. it's standard ammo with more juice.so is t2 ammo broken? i don't know. does it need to be a big improvement over t1? it probably is an improvement over normal t1 ammo already as it can do new tricks. is t2 ammo suposed to be the best and make me a lot of money to build and sell it? probably not. go build t1 ammo and trade it for faction from your agent and sell that. more people prefer the faction stuff and that doesn't mean that t2 is broken."
"i agree. conflag? that green stuff you mean x-ray right? you say its short range and high damage, so you mean amarr navy multifrequency? wait you mean to tell me there is tech 2 short range ammo the slight damage increase with penalties to tracking and cap use just make conflag not worth using. that and in most cases i would rather have more em damage then thermal damage, them caldari folk like to tank for guristas and manufacturing t2 ammo just sucks ass.... 2 weeks to build 40 scorch l, thats 10 runs with a pe -4 bpc. really, thats not cool"
"def. needs a fix, and these are a few good ideas."
"with a few exceptions, t2 ammo is either a one-trick pony (range ammo) or sucks outright (most close-range ammo). scorch and javelin hams are the only two that i see regularly used over faction ammo.please make them better!"
"especially short range. long range ac/pulse ammo is basically fine."
"t2 ammo definitely needs some luvin."
"i wonder if ccp could make a chart of the % of each ammo type used with each gun. that would certainly point out what needs boosting. as it is alot of t2 ammo that was supposed to be 'situational' is 'to be used in no situation'. even if the bonuses need to be lowered in exchange for no penalties, it's fairly obvious that much of the ammo is completely useless as is."
"for once a good topic in this forum.it would be ok if t2 ammo actually was situational like advertised, but so much of it is simply crap compared to faction ammo in all situations. the penalties of using it is usually too heavy."
"agree with the idea of overhauling t2-ammo. but not the specifics in this thread."
"just undo the nerfs introduced in revelations tbh. don't see the point of void if it's not going to hit anything or javelin if you can't move."
"things like spike, aurora and tremor (for long range) and null, scorch and barrage are nice and have their own niche.close range stuff has way too many penalties that make their effective dps lower than faction ingame."

"to not stifle any interesting thought on this subject i am going to try to keep this post short and simple. please elaborate with your ideas.recently the eve economist implemented a plan to remove the price caps from trit by making shuttles no longer an item produced by npcs. the intention was to remove artificial price caps on tritanium. while i believe (as a marketeer) that the sentiment of this is a great idea i think the implementation left a lot to be desired. also, implementation is problematic as as one price cap is eliminated 20 others are discovered.overall the market in eve needs something to make it prolific for both new industrialists as well as old. i have an idea i think that would considerably improve the overall market and increase the feasibility of new and old characters to participate in industry and trading.the root of the problem lies in the calculations used to produce npc prices of low end items. if i recall correctly from the dev blog on this topic all prices of items in eve are based on static base prices that are derived from some magic number value of minerals. this leads to market prices of low end items being static and unchanging no matter what supply and demand it and no matter to the supply of minerals.a shuttle takes 2500 tritanium to produce. this means that at the old market price of 9000 isk the shuttle is valued at 3.6 isk per unit of tritanium. this is clearly not how a real market would work. a corporation would base the end price of the shuttle on the cost of materials and add a margin of profit they would want on top of this price.this leads to my idea that is to nix this static pricing and come up with a system that generates regional prices of npc sold items based on the price of regional minerals. so, rather than base the price of the shuttle on a static value of tritanium base it on the average market price of tritanium, then add a margin.an example: lets say tritanium is selling for 3 isk a unit in the forge. the corporation wants a 20% margin on what it sells. this would mean the material cost of the shuttle would be 7500 isk. then you add on the margin of 20%, which would be 1500 isk. the total price would then be 9000 isk. if trit dropped to 2 isk a unit the shuttle price would be 6000, if the price of trit shot up to 9 isk a shuttle would cost 27000 isk.new prices could be applied at downtime. mineral prices could be an average of sell price in the region for the day.the effect of this would be very interesting. inter-region trading could become a very profitable enterprise for fledgling traders. enterprising industrialists could produce items in a region where trit was very cheap and ship them to a region where it was expensive and have a good profit. this would revitalize the tech 1 market and give newer players a shot at having a profitable career without having to train for 6 months to get into t2 gear where competition is already hampered by existing bpos from the bpo lottery.ive tried to keep this simple so other can add ideas or suggestions ive also tried to base the idea on math that already exists inside eve (regional averages). so, while i am programmer, i wont claim to know how easy things are to change in eve, but my suggestion seems within the realm of possibility.your thoughts?"
"i don't know what price caps exist, as of right now, that are actually affecting prices. there's no ship that's had its mineral value pushed down so far that the insurance price floor is affecting it, and while i admit that i don't generally have to think in terms of large-scale logistics, i can't think of any others that are relevant right now. i'll just stick by what seems to be the current plan of dealing with price limits - change them as they become relevant."
"you realise that even with rof bonus a 800mm t2 ac is lower than a unbonused neutron blaster with both behind a unbonused seige launcher. in fact a megathron with 1 mfs or a 2 hs abaddon will have around the same dps per turret as a 3 gyro maelstrom. the only reason ac's are fine on a maelstrom is because the maelstrom shield tanks so can fit the damage mods. if you look at tempest with no damage mods its dps per turret is 76 and seige launchers are 72, thats a rof + dmg bonused weapon only just beating a unbonused weapon. large ac's on a typhoon is frankly comical with around 50 dps per turret when its bonused seige are doing 95.hell rather than just raising the base damage, even if it was only by 1 point at large size i'd prefer them moving pp and fusion to the max damage level and lower emp plus fixing hail (and all other t2 close range ammos).the main issue with ac's is the lack of reason to upgrade per tier. tracking between dual 425's vs electrons is 8% advantage and 800's vs neutrons is practically identicle. you get no extra range besides a few hundred km optimal unlike other races where larger tier means significantly more optimal and falloff.the difference in our comparisons is the huge difference in damage source, it would be quite clear that the weapon system that already gives the best damage per turret wouldn't need it increasing further. for example 3 gyro 800mm on tempest is 125 dps/turret with 3 mfs neutrons 133 dps/turret (hyper or mega) so is not only behind on dps/turret, its behind on turrets and slots available for damage mods unless you use a 4 slot shield tank.but whatever, there's still a lot of tweaking needed of the ammos and tier system of ac's without even changing the end damage amounts of the ships."
"i support a boost to minmatar autocannons.the damage with 3 damage mods is frankly too poor."
"and this matters because? 800mm t2 ac on a mael will do more damage with hail than it will with neutron blasters. with emp the ship will have up to 30km falloff.so now you are complaining that your low tier weapons are too good? that it hurts others more when downsizing? so we should nerf 650 acs and 425s?1 damage mod on a mega with electrons does 608 damage with no drones to 3+7km(cn am). 0 damage mods on a tempest with 425s, siege, and hail does 594 damage with no drones to 2.4+10km. [plus launcher damage]. that is as much damage with more range.ahh yes, lets conveniently ignore the 6 lows on the hyperion and the 2 free high slots fir missile launchers[which do not fit in any fit on the mega].so the idea is to make the ammos do more damage but not affect the final dps of the ships?why nerf 2 things and buff something else when you could just buff one thing?"
"first off, all the people *****ing about my setups, post yours, please. i'd like to see them.fittitng mods are fitting mods - sometimes you need them. a 2-slot shield tank isn't a serious option, thus you want an armour repper, and that takes grid. but after your complaints, i see i did fit it wrong - drop the 650s to 425s, drop the pds for a bcs ii - goes from 917 dps to 980, and you don't lose much of anything on cap or shield hp. can even raise that to 1063 if you drop a tank mod to add another - losing an eanm costs you 8k hp and 46 dps tanked, but gains you 83 dps dealt. depends how much of a glass cannon you want.if you're going to compare it to the mael, then yeah, it's worse at everythign but speed. the mael is probably the best pvp battleship in the game, at least for close-in work in small gang. i'm trying to see what the tempest can do, and this is the best answer i've found to that. that said, you'd have to be nuts to fit an istab on a mael - you'd have to strip a gyrostab for that.why is it pointless? you've got the slots for an adequate one(though certainly not great), and you want the lows clear for your damage mods.yeah, pulses switch range really well. your point? the minmatar either get in close where range doesn't matter, or they orbit at a speed where slow-tracking lasers can't hit them. it's kinda what they do - you know, the speed race? also, it's almost a 400 m/s difference, not 200.missiles switch damage better than projectiles, but projectiles switch better than hybrids or lasers. i'll take what i can get. and you're right about 800s and neutrons tracking similarly, but it's still a big advantage they have over pulses.i'm also looking to be cost-efficient in my pvp fits, and void is about 20% of the price of cn am where i am now. and compared to am, void gets an optimal bonus.of course it's not fitting tackle - i said right at the beginning of this that i was fitting for small gang - i.e., i assume a tackler. battleships have better things to fit than webs and scrams.re pest, basic is what fits. if you want to hardwire for cpu, feel free. adds 49 dps. or go for a rf gyrostab, and add 68 dps. i was trying to standardize though, so i used a basic. sue me.re mael, test your arguments. even dropping it to 425's, it's still 18 cpu over."
"this thread is almost as bad as large autocannons"
"supported. however, if ships are changed (namely the maelstrom and the tempest) than it might not need to be a large change? also, change might be done with ammo.oh, and please don't post terrible fits in this thread."
"supported, though i'd rather see the tempest brought in line with other fleet snipers."
"are you being dense on purpose? i never suggested using blasters on a maelstrom (that was someone else). my point is if even a rof bonus on ac's is behind unbonused weapon how far behind do you think it is vs a bonused weapon? wtf did i say they were to good? clearly the point of this topic is flying over your head, you realise how idiotic you look right now suggesting nerfing ac's? if people are gonna say \"but ac's have x advantage\" they might want to actually look and not just go by rumour because they'll find the advantages arn't what they think.and whats the range of the torps? so what is the range that \"as much damage with more range\"? its a limited area nevermind the lost damage from torps sig that complicates things when comparing turrets.wtf did i compare end damage? i didn't bring drones into it either so why are you ignoring them if you bring missiles into it? yes because the hyperion doesn't have a better tank so can't afford to use one of its lows on a damage mod. and yes clearly when talking about damage per turret ignoring a unbonused weapon that isn't affected by the damage mods is bad... you do realise the launchers do less dps per tempest/mega/hyper turret so actually bring the average of the fitted weapons down.my current idea is to not affect the raw damage amount but to reorder the damage types (or change the damage types of emp) as the best ammo does not have the advantage it used to at the start of eve and was given the lower raw damage amount because of.no idea what 2 things am i meant to of suggested to nerf ?"
"any reasonable (and costing less then a mothership) bs will never out-traverse a short-range bs gun outside of webrange (14km+, as being closer makes you suspectible to getting webbed) to provide any meaningful damage mitigation. this sort of comment makes me wonder if you pvp at all (or just pvp in pve drakes so you've got no clue about how turrets work?). seriously.in small gangs, a part of the bs (the ones which can do so without making big sacrifices; armour tankers mainly) do fit tackle.reasons:(a) tacklers can't point a lot of people unless you've outblobbing someone and therefore have enough tacklers and enough bs. in that case, you'll probably win anyway, so it doesn't matter.(b) your tacklers are liable to get fried (tackler killing is almost my speciality). if your bs cannot hold a web/point, then you're not likely to score kills. in fact, without some of your bs having webs, you're likely to die.(c) if you are not going to fit tackle, i'd suggest eccm-ing your ship. unless you also out-ew your opponent, in which case you'll win anyway and fittings dont matter.(d) the typhoon doesn't need any fitting mods at all. ever. also, fitting basic gyro and 2 fitting mods on a tempest is pure and total fail. a third basic gyro (with all the stacking penalities plus being a basic piece of junk) does virtually nothing.anyway - back to the topic.i'd sooner give the tempest some loving (100m3 drone bandwidth, 175m3 dronebay, 10% more agility), then switch out the armour hp and shield hp values on the typhoon and tempest (and possibly give maelstorm a slight agility buff) and see how it pans out.if i wanted to do anything with large acs, i'd give them somewhat (read: 5-10%) better tracking rather then straight out dps. it'd be a nice buff.i'm more in favour of slight buffs then major changes which need to be rebalanced yet again later on."
"signed/ minmatar haven't gotten any love in a long time"
"my setups arn't a secret, go look on shc.sometimes you do, only on my dual rep typhoon do i use a single acr rig. your tank is pathetic and your talking about fitting more damage mods? seriously do you just gank people that can't shoot back? glass cannon? more like a glass wet fish. you use a single rep setup, a medium cap booster is enough to feed it, that saves both the rcu and pds slot for more resistances to give a big increase in tank.doesn't suprise me that you can't do anything appart from the obvious to fit your ship. admittedly i have a +3% cpu implant (all of 20m) and named dc to fit an istab that gives me better agility than your tempest. if being clever you could remove one of your mid tank modules for a lower cpu mod (passive em for example), named dc to save more cpu then fit the istab with no hardwiring.because the maelstrom in a similar fit will outperform it every time.point is your doing much better dps sooner than the ships that have to mwd (even with better speed) to the target. orbiting battleships?!? i've heard it all, clearly you do not pvp on tq or at least with minmatar battleships.its a minor difference since its so hard to get that advantage ingame due to the range/transversal you have to hit while usually webbed.well thats your problem if you want to be less effective.small gang and your not tackling? tackler dies then your useless.sounds like the typical sisi pilot with there max tanks and no tackle because \"everything costs 100isk so why warp\"."
"tell em marn. i think that yamamoto guy is a goumidong alt the amount of uniformed bull**** he spews."
"look, just because minmatar bs aren't gallente bs doesn't mean we need to buff them. i've fought against all minmatar bs (small gang and fleet) and i have no complaints about any of them. they're actually really good. sure, a mega might out-damage a tempest. but tempest can easily stay out of range or deal enough damage to kill the mega before it has time to kill the pest. besides, the average bs tank in pvp is about 300-400. in a gang with just about any ewar, an armor tanked pest will be easily enough to break tanks (plus damage from whoever else is in your gang). i've seen phoons kill hyperions solo, and (see above) a mael kill two hyperions at the same time. i've seen a pest tank three domis (admittedly, the domi's weren't very good, but still). what are you complaining about?also, depending on your gang, you often don't need tackle gear on bs. no self-respecting gang has only one point. even if your bs doesn't have one, you'll still probably have at least one (probably two) inties, a hac and possibly a recon--all with points. the extra damage is worth the lack of tackle. if it will shut you people up, then fine. give them better tracking or base falloff. but increasing their damage any more is just rediculous. a mael can already out-damage a hyperion and at longer ranges too (if the hyp wants to fit a tank); a buff would be overkill. and quit saying pests are bad because they can't stand up to a mael. that's like saying exequrors are bad because they can't stand up to thoraxs. bottom line: minmatar are fast and versatile. they deal enough damage with their weapons (acs, missiles and drones)to compete with any other bs."

"and this matters because? oh wait, it doesn't because it only matters how it performs on the ships and it performs just fine on the ships except the tempest.1+1=2. you see you are complaining that there is no reason to upgrade your weapons. well ****, that is the same as getting more for downgrading. you are essentially complaining that your low tier weapons are too good. if you want to lose range like blasters and lasers do, and if you want to gain less tracking like blasters and lasers do then fine i guess. its ******ed, but its your decision. the only reason to buff the top ends would be if the top ends were under performing. but we just showed that the top ends weren't under performing because we have a ship performing just fine with them. no, you didn't and that is why your argument is ******ed. if you took the drones away from the megathron it would suck balls because it would be doing ****ty dps at a ****tier range.so with the tempest when you ignore its two other high slots that it can actually fit and ignore its drones it sure does look ****ty. and while its not great because it has deficiencies in those areas it means you can fix those areas to make the ship fine.it doesn't matter if the average goes down if the final number goes up. and oh look, it does! now if you are saying that the tempest ought to do more dps than the hyperion or megathron you are just ******ed. if you move fusion/pp to 11 base you will just nerf the lot of them since hail is 14. and faction fusion isn't coming close. the 2 things you would have to nerf would be the phoon and the maelstrom."
"no. just wrong. the speed advantage at bs level is absolutely minimal. minimal. and the agility is the same as gallente. a tempest can't stay out of range of anything. one minmatar bs deals good damage, that's the typhoon. the tempest is useless, and the mael has a lot of problems."
"the tempest isn't useless it's really useful if you want to see big numbers."

"market  seller column in marketi love most of the idea's so, on the whole this definitly has my support.but, is the item mentioned above translated as 'showing the name of the seller' i question it's validity. market should be economic pvp only. by being able to determine who the actual seller is you bring politics and/or opinions in to play. then motives like the sellers standing to you or your corp or even your own 'reputation' start to out weigh economic descisions. imagine being a famous pirate (who everyone hates) and trying to sell stuff.as a result everyone will use an non-allied, unknown alt to sell their stuff, resulting in the whole point being useless anyways."

"you can't make them too cheap, otherwise people will start to use them in missions. i wouldn't reduce the cost to less than 5 million per bomb.however, the mechanics for deploying bombs need to be revised. currently it's too difficult and not rewarding enough."
"oh, and supported."
"make bombs act like normal missiles do, and prevent them from damaging other bombs, and a small price reduction [honestly, 7.5m would be the lowest i would suggest, but nothing below 5m per shot] would help these vastly under-used things thrive.it would be disgustingly expensive to use them casually still, but in a small fleet on fleet engagement [30 ships on either side?] a squad of bombers successfully jumping on the enemy fleet might be able to cripple the enemy long enough to break the stalemate.also, maybe if they weren't so suicidally it would be good too... increase the duration of the bomb, and reduce the speed a tad to give the bombers a chance to disengage and get out."
"since bombs can't be used in empire worries about mission whoring with bombs is silly. however bombs do need to made:1 cheaper. its like losing a bc if you get popped with full load.2. need to go off every time whether you are alive or dead near or in warp. you should be able to drop it and go.3. more damage. 4. drop while cloaked (though it decloaks the ship once released- that would be a nice compromise.)5. let it drop more the one bomb at a time like...a bomber or give us cluster bombs for smaller targets.6. make them cheaper along the lines of faction ammo (i know i said it already but it bears repeating,"

"as long as there are counters to a falcon (and there are), they are not overpowered. if you want to cripple the only ship the caldari have that does anything well, then lets nerf nanoing of all ships. the same logic i have been reading in this thread can be applied to that or many other ships for that matter.just get over it and play the game."
"oh, please. if the caldari didn't have: - blackbird (best gang support t1 cruiser)- drake (a awesome pvp bc if you stopped fitting it like a mission runner and trained some fitting skills)- scorpion (awesome ecm gang support bs)- raven (awesome gang bs)- rokh (same as raven, but with more tank and turrets),- rook (now underused thanks to falcons, but oh well)- crow (do i really need to say anything)- kitsune (best eaf)- griffin (best gang support t1 frig) and so on, you'd have a point there.caldari don't deserve the 'onoz, we have only one effective ship' crap."
"it is not the counters that decides if a ship is overpowered or not. it is decided by how it performs compared to its sister ships and how it affect the overall gamplay. the arazu could be countered by sensor boosters, nano-phoon by webifiers and myrmidon by smartbombs yet they all got nerfed.i dont want to cripple the falcon, i want it to become something else. the effect of 200km falcons in low sec is changing the pvp for the negative. to counter this falcon development you will either have to fly nano gangs or bring more ecm. when not even a bs gang can deal with a falcon, image the effect on a bc/command gang. a falcon can probably keep 6 cruisers jammed. however all this would be ok, as long as the ships have a fair chance of killing the falcon. now they don't. i personally don't understand why caldari pilots don't want the falcon changed. changing the falcon so it could actually operate and survive at close/medium range would give you another tactical option, not just long range jamming."
"falcons are ok now, no need to mess with good ship, fix myrmydion tho ;p"
"falcon is almost ok. it has two problems:- huge range make it untouchable for short-range combat (as noted in the op)- there is no reason to fly a rook instead unless you want 100dps more in your gang. hell, there's not even a reason to fly a scorp (bs!) instead. falcon is making two ships almost obsolete.to counter the range thing, give gallente recons a use. make them anti-sniper. give damps a range similar to ecm (with falloff, so it's not a 100% killer at those distances).to counter the rook/scorp problem, reduce the ecm strength bonus on a falcon slightly (back to 15%). it can still jam the hell out of a lot of stuff, but the rook will actually have a use then."
"have y'all seen this post? just look at those numbers... *edit* you need to enable images on your forum settings to see this, but the numbers are absolutely unreal. just try and show me something that compares to this!this totally breaks small gang pvp. solo bs? 2-3 man gang? lol you're sol m8. hope your third guy is a falcon or you're going home in a pod.one racial has an 86% chance to jam my geddon, one multi is 58% chance. if i use 1/3 of my total mid slots i can basically halve that number. and then one jammer only jams me 44% and 29% of the time, not counting lock time. let's hope he doesnt have more than one jammer fitted!!! eccm doesn't counter jamming in small gangs.there is no real counter in a small gang other than bringin one of your own. every other ship-type 'counters' ignore the fact that in a small gang setup you're limited by your pilot numbers. the whole meta-fitting idea behind small gangs is fit a small number of ships to be adaptable enough to deal with a large range of targets. fitting to deal with a falcon requires a dedicated vessel or a falcon of your own. this is not countering a falcon.the second thread linked by the op is my thread. i offer three viable solutions, my favorite solution being stacking penalties combined with racials losing their 'off-race' strength. let me go over that one more time.it won't change the falcon in large 'fleet-style' fights. you still will be applying a max of 1-2 jammers on correct racial targets at nearly no jam strength reduction. you'll still reduce their overall dps/rr/ff ability. hell, in 'fleet-style' pvp eccms even work, since there are more targets than jammers and if everyone fits an eccm than the falcon can't jam as many guys.this breaks down in small man pvp. where even if you're 2x as hard to jam, that just means the falcon gives you a few extra jammers, often off-race, and still effectively perma jams you. if you stacking penalize jammers and remove off-race strength then:a) multis see more use, lowering range, and indirectly lower overall jams, since multies are less strong. this makes overall jamming a little lower and makes nanos a stronger counter, since they have less range to cover.b) it gives small gang ships fitting eccm a realistic level of jamming protection. if the falcon can only really apply 2-4 jammers, with the third and fourth being pretty weak then if you fit an eccm you might be able to get more than 1 lock cycle a fight!! the best part is, your 0.0 blob performance is nearly identical. you pretty much don't lose anything whule it becomes possible to small gang pvp without being perma-jammed by an untouchable falcon..."
"very nice ideas, endless :-)"
"although it seems that i've been defending the falcon in my posts here, i've really been criticising those that maintain there is no counter other than dedicated, single-role ships, because that's palpable nonsense. endless's quote: \" \"fitting to deal with a falcon requires a dedicated vessel or a falcon of your own.\" is simply not true. any viable remote-rep bs gang has room for a sniper, and any gang has room for - indeed, requires - a fast tackler capable of acting as a on-grid warp-in point.but the quote above highlights the real problem - that the rook is now useless. i always thought that the falcon should never have received the same ecm bonus as the rook, because of the huge force multiplier of the cloak, but that the old 10%/level bonus was inadequate. 15%/level would be ideal.also, the scorpion is far from obsolete. unlike the falcon, it has the ehp to survive some dps and the systems for non-ecm self-defence, like neuts and smarties. and, being t1, it's almost free."
"well, to be quite honest, they couldn't. arazu could still damp a battleship to a range at which it was unable to do anything. nanophoon's inertia could still carry it to the gate even when quadruple-webbed. i agree that a ships' performance should be compared to it's sister ships, but in that sense there are only four dedicated jamming ships available: rook, falcon, bb and the scorpion - others are multirole ships, especially gallente and amarr recons. out of those four, the falcon is unarguably the best.personally, i feel the following way: unless i can stay at a range where i have ample time to do something against the opposing gang, i know i will die. if there is even a single ship that can target me, it will, and it will remove me from combat. granted, i don't do lowsec small (3-6) man warfare, so i do not feel flying an overpowered ship - there's always someone targeting me.that does not mean that your argument is invalid, however. but on the other hand, changing my ship to balance your combat environment feels wrong if removing a show-stopper from your arena means that i'd never take a falcon into my combat environment again. thus, the question is, what to do with the falcon.to keep the ew lineup focused strictly on ew (and being paper-thin), i don't really see how one could change the bonuses. range of <100km with racials means it's not useful, unless it's ew effectiveness is increased and by giving it an another midslot (since a single missed cycle means instadeath, making the ew combat into a coinflip: either you win or you lose, there's nothing in between). but it would remove them from lowsec, i guess.i might be tempted to make the falcon into a nanoship, though: drastically increased speed and more lowslots, say 5 lows: you balance range with polycarbs (rigs), you balance cap stability with jamming (mids: cap batteries/rechargers - mwd/jammers) and jamming strenght with speed (lows: ods vs sdas). perhaps part of the speed increase could come from the ecm range bonus being changed to extra 5% speed per level -bonus. it'd also become the first real caldari nanoship."
"maybe in 0.0, and even there, actually, no. the \"small\" in \"small roaming gangs\" refers to 3-4 bs tops, and that's actually on the big side. endless refers to 2-3 ships total. you do not have the room to drop 20%+ of your dps for a sniper.falcon is basically guaranteed to jam a tackler (inty, hac). 200km takes a long time to cover. falcon has all the time in the world to lock, jam, and warp off."
"the tackling inty isn't the problem. the problem is the ships - and more importantly, their drones - that warp to the tackler. also, you're neglecting recons and their excellent sensor strengths. an arazu or lachesis is tough enough to jam, even without considering eccm, and will completely shut down a falcon once in damp range. a curse will similarly ruin a falcon pilot's day. jamming an ishtar aggros its drones. these are standard small gang ships.in any case, a falcon that warps off is a falcon neutralised. he won't be back on the field for a good minute, and longer if he has to do a further warp so he comes back to the field on a different vector. yes, if he's prepared, then he'll have on grid bms to warp between... but why don't you?"
"way to pull it out of context, again. small gang pvp gpysio, specifically in low sec. it doesn't sound like it's a problem in larger gangs where there is the option to bring anti-falcon support without gimping the entire gang. my suggestions don't limit it's role here at all. but in small gangs, we're limited by pilot numbers. outline a 2-3 man gang where it's better to have an anti-falcon ship than a falcon of your own or a 2-3 man gang in low sec that has an inty in it and i'll give you a better gang everytime."
"while the falcon warps off, yes. and we're back at the original problem. to provide a warp-in, the tackler needs to tackle, and if it's just for 20 seconds. and an inty can't.a single racial jammer module on an unrigged, mediocre-skilled falcon has 43.3% jam chance on an arazu. multispec is 28.1%. half that if the arazu fits an eccm module. but the arazu won't get into range. it needs to travel 160km either visibly to the falcon - 160km time for the falcon to warp - or 160km cloaked, which will take longer than the fight lasts.an arazu with four damps will bring a falcon with 250km lock range down to 54km lock range, which is long enough to lock the arazu. far from \"completely shut down\".same problem for travelling 250km in a curse.you have 250km drone control range on your ishtar?not in low-sec, actually (none of them can usefully tank sentries).yes, you just used half your gang (2 ships or so) to \"neutralize\" a hostile ship, while the other half of your gang got blown up. job well done for the falcon.uhm.no one asked for the falcon to be made useless. it's just a tiny bit too good at what it does right now. (i still like endless' ideas. stacking penalty, yes please. :-))"
"no. you can warp to any gang member on grid beyond 150 km. he doesn't have to tackle someone to enable this. 160 km will take an arazu about 45 seconds. it's more like 150 km anyway, accounting for overheated scram and typical combat ranges (and that requires the falcon to have a bm net and not just have warped in at 100 km). and even less to apply damps and prevent the falcon from jamming your dps ships. similar for curse. ishtar will get into range just as quickly as any other hac/recon, or it can just deploy sentries and not have to worry about drone travel time.the tools are there. the last few times i've flown my falcon, i've been damped and killed by an arazu, had a face full of beam from an apoc, then had a huginn on-grid warp to a crow that had mwded up to me. sometimes i've been able to warp out - then have to explain to my gang why i wasn't contributing. nanoishtar and fof cerberus will be next, i expect.but having said all this, i still support a reduction to 15%/level, to make to rook viable."
"falcon is fine, don't nerf the last good caldari ship please"
"this sentiment is both awful for game balance and unfounded.even if all the other caldari ships were rubbish, which they aren't, using that to justify the existance of an overpowered caldari ship is not 'balance'. overpowered ships need to be brought into balance to ensure a better game environment."
"lets put it this way.we either have effective ewar-ships in the game or we don't. if we do, they will be in widespread use due to their effectiveness and general unwillingness to fit anti-ewar modules that makes them capable of turning the tide of a small skirmish. this is also due to the fact that defending against dps is effective against all types of dps: a plate doesn't care if it's taking em or kinetic damage, it's simply increasing your hp buffer. otoh, every anti-ewar module is simply focused against one thing and is generally ballast if you're not facing the thing you're trying to defend against. thus, people do not generally fit them, because to fit them means gimping your tank/gank/general combat capability.nobody really used falcons/rooks when lachesis/arazu was as effective as it was before the damp nerf. thus, i claim that there will always be a need for people to fly effective ewar ships. nerf them and we're back to either blobs or nanos.i'd rather do one of the two things:either boost the other ewar-ships significantly. especially the cloaking variants. give the pilgrim it's range bonus and whatever it takes to make it <U+FFFD>ber. raise the bonuses on gallente and minmatar recons to something that's utterly insane. or make variations of the modules used in pvp (plates, hardeners, mwds, scrams, webs, extenders, damage mods, whatever) have different versions that also improve targeting range, scan resolution, sensor strenght, whatever, at the expense of module effectiveness/range/whatever. one could use scripts or somethign for that. that'd make ewar tanking more viable without removing the capabilities of the ship that wants to just focus on murderlating everyone with raw dps; it'd just have to give up some of the tank/gank/whatever on the fly to protect against the sudden situation where the opposing side has powerful ecm put against them."
"when it comes to the paper thintank it is so because you chose to fit it that way. falcons have the same option to fit a tank as the rest of the force recons. it is because of the offensive capabilities it has that it is called primary, not its lack of tank. i don't think it means instadeath if it looses a cycle either. all the other recons have to stay within 100km, and they seem to somewhat manage.i agree, ewar ships add an important tactical element to the combat. however 200km falcons does not add to low sec pvp, they prevent it.im not sure how the recons should be balanced tbh, there is a lot of options here. i have always considered the combat recon to be the standard one and the force recon a lighter version with a cov ops cloak. not the other way around.i think to boost all the force recons would instantly obsolete the combat recons. i guess some overall balancing would be in order for the whole line, but the falcon definitely needs to be changed."
"with the right fit on a cerb, you can get its missile to hit at 180k easily. also, why snipe with a bs? snipe with a hac or command ship. the eagle can be setup to hit at over 180k. heck, i've set a harpy to hit at 180k. granted, the harpy hits will be laughable... but an eagle or say, astarte, they'll be backing off real quick."
"there is definitively a need for ccp to look 0.0 sovereignty mechanics. even trying to make it more diffucult for a single entity to hold large portions of space."
"[thumbs up]"
"tusko i think this is an excellent point. the mechanics of sovereignty really should accurately reflect the usage/patrolling of space by the the controlling entity - so a revamp of sovereignty would want to have in mind mechanics that result in space being marked as \"owned\" by alliances that are frequenting that space, and unfrequented space should easily default to unclaimed status."
"sovereignty really needs to reflect an entity's ability to control space with ships, not their ability to put up pos.tt"
"that is boring and static it results in players who want to keep space having to have a job to maintain it. pos logistics are bad enough as it is there is no reason to go and make everyone do **** like that."
"myrmydion is currently only bc which has been literally castrated and useless. myrm bonus is practically unusable because of its drone bandwidth which cannot be utilized successfully with 5 medium drones. there is no even possibility to rat in it decently in 0.0 which is doable in any tier any race bc.myrm need something extra, if we gonna stick with drone boat, it should be able at least release 4 heavies and 1 med/small and have additional place for at least one set of smalls.even useless ferox can be utilized as cheap eagle, myrmydion cannot be compared ishtar anyway.i'm familiar with projectiles setup - but even than myrm is just castrate.do something, i like vertical ships ;)"
"but... but all vertical ships are the worst of their kind. you can't upset the natural balance, you can't play -dev- with nature itself!but seriously. why should the myr have more bandwidth than the eos?"
"myrm is perfectly fine as it is. it can no longer do it all - tank, gank, and drone. it could in the past, which is why they changed it."
"yeah, the eos got castrated too. they should have stripped turrets off the drone boats that had too much dps, not stripped drones. knock off 2-3 turrets on each, give them back their 125 bandwidth. i think the op is overstating his case here - the myrm is hardly useless, and it was a little too good before the change - but the bandwidth nerf was inappropriate and should be rolled back in favour of the correct nerf."
"fix the myrm. -2 turrets (or even 3) and back to 125 bandwitdh."
"i use a prophecy in stain, with great success and it was only mildly slower than a cruise lobbing raven. a harbinger is even better.i was able to use these two ships against grista and serpentis, then i took 3 days out of my time and trained for a drake.honestly the drake is an awesome 0.0 ratting ship.smaller, faster, 7 heavy missile firring at a good pace and awesome damage if your killing kinetic rats.1 high spot left for a cloak device. hostile enters, even if they are in ceptors, you can warp to ss and cloak faster then they will to find your belt.rate of killing even officers in a drake in incredible. if you're looking at pure bounty, load up a drake with ki heavies, passive tank, a cloak, and 2 bcu-ii's and you'll clear belts in minutes and move on.if you get caught you have 5 light drone and 7 heavy missiles at your disposal to dish out some serious damage. if you die, the entire setup cost less then 50mil. which you could easily make an one hour of chaining."
"um...no.not supported."
"the issue is that it requires the full key of a ceo or director of the corp. if the developer or person hosting a killboard collected those keys they would then have access to all the api data for both that person and the corp. this is preventing a lot of people who would like to use the killmail feature of the api from doing so.i think we definitely need a way to create a number of keys that can be assigned one or more specific roles like kill data, character sheet data, market data, corp market data and so on. you could then use one key for your killboard, another for evemon, another for market analysis tools, etc."
"folks, since the csm has been developed and put into action there have been constant bickering by characters less than 8 months old that dont have any idea what theyre talking about. \"nerf what i dont have skills to use and buff what i have skills to use\". this human nature of complaining has gone far enough. so to get an actual feel for the community there should be a character age limit on to who can post on the forums. just as there are voting, drinking, and driving ages in many nations of the world there should be a forum age. stop the arm-chair generals today!"
"unfortunately that is a bit off. this character is my third life in eve. i started long ago. so the age of the character has no bearing. nor does a \"bought\" 3+ year char being manipulated by a n00b that has no idea about mechanics at all. and by you suggestion it will give validity to an idiot who bought a 3 year character that does not have 6 weeks in the game.unfortunately what you are suggesting is that a large chunk of the player base to be silenced which will go over like a wet fart in church.i do see what you are saying. that we have a bunch of players that do not really understand the game yet making knee jerk suggestions not understanding what damage it can cause or the long term effects. and whine threads has been going on long before the csm. they just happen to find another place to post."
"nerf whining!"
"the suggestion to make the largest weapons system out there effective against smaller targets is just a tad on the silly side.i personally thing ham's are a little hard to fit on any ship that can use them to do damage, and a little light on the damage side on the ships than can fit them more easily."
"torps are nice, i haven't use hams yet (maybe i should... hmm, damnation)."
"torps are great, but hams could use a bit of help."
"torps are useful, but not in thr right way. when one thinks of torpedos, you think of very long range, very high damage, very slow missiles -the sort of thing you use to tackle poss and supercaps from 150km with. as torps are, they satisfy criteria 2 and 3, but don't get number one at all. i think that the high-fitting missiles should be something like this:cruise missiles: high velocity/explosion speed, low explosion radius, very long range. pretty much as is.torpedos: something like 1000m/s base speed, 11 or 12 second base flight time. about the same damage/explosion speed/radius as they currently are.third option: not sure what should go here, but it should fill the role that torps currently use. maybe a very rapid firing heavy/ham launcher, ala the assault launcher? maybe something more akin to the bomb launcher? don't really know.so while i don't really know too much about hams (was told they were crap, never touched them), i do think that torps need a major rethink."
"heavy missile , cruise missile = railgunham , torp = blasteri think it works pretty well from the torpedo standpoint. put an mwd on your raven and melt the big belt rats. hams not trained. i wanted the range when in a cruiser or bc."
"hams are absolutely great on a cerberus. while i wish they had a bit more damage potential than close range gun counterparts due to delayed damage, i'm fairly happy with them on this ship.torps totally rock on a raven. while i wish they had a bit better range as i miss them for the occasional ratting. it is possible to fit up a raven to rat with them still. as for pvp, these rock.course, caldari have always been about range. so i'm a bit biased."
"hams are awesome on a drake, too. as the drake is shield-tanked, it can fit more damage mods than other bcs and have a good tank at the same time, easily outweighting the slightly lower dps of these compared to other close-range weapons. the range is also quite good (optimal+falloff, in parens with long-range tech 2 ammo). blasters 1.5+3.8 (3.8+4.7), acs 1.4+10 (2.7+15), pulses 7.5+5 (23+5), ham 20 (82(!!)).torps are a good deal beyond overpowered if you ask me. that horse has been beaten to death, but torp raven gets the dps of a blaster megathron at triple the range, and little to no drawbacks. torp range is also quite ok at 25km (30km theoretical) with tech 1 ammo, or up to 45km with tech 2 ammo..."
"when i think of torps i think of medium range fairly slow but highly fatal weapons, while cruise missiles are long range very fast but not so fatal ones. i am not exactly current on todays weapons, but iirc todays surface combatants have better chances to survive a hit from a cruise missile than from a modern torpedo.other space games i played also had torps as fairly short ranged weapons, even if there it was not due to flight time but due to them being easily interceptable when fires too far out."
"rockets need across the board help. torps are fine. hams are fine except that their pg requiements are ludicrously high, preventing caldari missile boats from using them properly."
"i'm afraid i cannot support your proposal, because you stuck two of them together. torpedos are fine imo. hams would be fine, if you could fit 5 ham ii + mwd ii + 2x bcs ii onto a caracal. and have enough grid remaining for some low power use midslot mods, but basically no tank."
"many of you may have noticed that tech 2 mods are only slightly less common on the market than dirt. this is primarily due to the invention system being implemented. although the invention system is a major improvement over the old lotto system (the less talked about the better), it still could use some major improvement in of itself.currently, invention creates tech 2 bpcs, period. i propose a percentage system that would make tech 2 bpcs less common, but generate more bpcs overall, creating bpcs to make limited runs of mid to high grade tech 1 mods and possibly the rare bpc of faction mods. let me use an example to help explain.lets say you wanted to invent off of a heavy missile launcher i blueprint. instead of the current system, what if the results breakdown was as follows:30% failure, nothing gained30% 10run bpc of 'malkuth' heavy missile launcher i20% 10run bpc of advanced 'limos' heavy missile bay i10% 10run bpc of xr-3200 heavy missile bay i5% 10run bpc of 'arbalest' heavy missile launcher i4.9% 10run bpc of heavy missile launcher ii.1% 5run bpc of a random faction heavy missile launcheri can think of several major effects this would have:1) tech 2 mods would become less common than they are now, but in light of the current market flood of tech 2 mods, i don't think that would be a major problem.2) mid-high grade tech 1 mods would become more common on the market, but would still be rarer and harder to aquire than the basic mod. this would eventually reduce the prices on these mods, but would do so more along the lines of module effectiveness as the better tech 1 mods would have a lower invention chance.3) faction mods would become somewhat more common, lowering the prices on them, but since there is only a 1 in 1000 chance to invent them, the effect would be minimal, and if invention of faction bpcs is a problem, that .1% could go into the tech 2 mod chance instead.4) moon mineral prices would drop due to fewer tech 2 module bpcs being invented5) asteroid mineral prices would rise due to an increase of tech i module manufacture.overall, i believe this could be a very good moderating force within the commodoties market at least for ship modules. in terms of effectiveness alone, the best standard tech 1 mods should be economically nearly the same price as their tech 2 counterparts. plus there would be a greater variety of modules being manufactured by industrialists, spreading out sales within the market among most, if not all of the standard tech 1 variants.remember also, the percentages i listed are just a basic example, and it may require some mathematical tweaking by the good doctor to make it as fair and balanced as possible. this proposed fix would take some time to reach its desired effectivness as there are still many tech 2 bpcs out there waiting to be used, and until they are, there will still be a flood of tech 2 mods on the market. this is a long-term fix, not an instant band-aid."
"i see no need for this - it'd spike t2 prices to where they were pre-invention(the added source doesn't much compensate for the added players), it'd make invention supplies more expensive in the process(thus putting brakes on the amount the system could be used), it'd gives us more trashy named gear than we already have - a lot of which isn't even worth manufacturing - and it'd provide a wholly unneeded stream of faction gear, which is supposed to be rare and faction-sourced."
"paragraph breaks for readabilitymany of the top-end named tech 1 mods (especially turrets) are significantly more expensive than their better tech 2 counterparts as it stands right now. an increase in the supply of these woundn't be a bad thing, giving moderately skilled players an opportunity to use gear that is better than the base modules without breaking them financially. the faction gear was an add-on to the idea, and would not necessarily be a requirement. some tweaking down of the supply of t2 bpcs wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, currently many t2 manufacturers cannot sell their mods reasonably due to the excessive supply. plus manufacturing prices would most likely drop due to the increase in moon mineral compounds on the market. this would at least minimally offset the increased cost of invention for t2 mods. as to spiking prices to pre-invention levels... i doubt it would be that bad, but the prices would increase. the trick is to find a balance between supply and demand, and unfortunately, right now, supply is winning big time."
"no, this would be bad for just about everyone."
"low-meta gear is already really easy to get your hands on. as a rule, meta 0 gear(t1) sells for a touch less than mineral price, meta 1-2 gear sells for not a lot more, and only meta 3-4 gear is expensive enough to be worried about. as for best named being more expensive than t2, of course it is. most of the time it has the same stats, but needs less fitting and lower skills. when that's not the case - say, with hardeners - the t2 variant tends to be far more valuable than the best-named."
"i don't agree with this one bit. if you want to build named tech one modules, then get at ccp to re-introduce reverse engineering and make it like invention, only for named products.you know, that isn't a bad idea..."
"originally started in ideas forum"
"your thread title indicates only drones but in the post you also want a command-type ship. i can kind of understand what you're asking for (basically a command link ship that dps's with drones because it's highs are full of command mods) but i think this is really not needed. here's why:my alt in a drake runs 4 ganglinks nonstop and has a cloak and cyno. it can't defend it's self but if it could while doing that then it would just be stupid.most ships in the game have a drone bay. since most ships (even most galente ships) don't have a drone bonus besides a generally bigger drone bay then it's just as important to have top notch drone skills as it is to have good speed or locking skills. you don't need the moros' 50% per level drone bonus to reak havok in a vagabond with well trained small ecm drones out. in a fight the drones will get off at least one jam which will let you escape a rapier every time.a common misconception about carriers is that it's just a big drone-spewing death machine. in reality it does not do it's dammage with it's drones. it's a logistics ship. it keeps your battleships and cap ships alive so that those ships survive to kill the enemy. i can't stress enough that a carier does about 2 bs of dammage but can make lots of friendly bs and caps invulnerable for long enough to turn the battle. also, fighters are 20m each, are slow, can't hit well, die easy, are so impractical you'll wish you never trained them, and you'll use ordinary drones about 90% of the time.... or loose millions of isk in fighters learning not to pull them out.a ship that is between the size of a battleship and a carrier causes me some worry though. first you would have to get over the fact that bs' play a decreased role today as they are slow, have troubble defending from small things, and are generally less desireable than a plain old cruiser in roaming ops. because of it's sluggishness it is usually an all or nothing commitment to deploy a battleship whereas a cruiser can do good dammage and escape repeatedly for less investment. so my question is... what would your jumbo battleship provide that will make it usefull given it's immobility and big price tag? the gang mods and drones idea doesn't really stack up due to the bc/commandship alternative and because you have no reason to not train drones for the other ships you'll use on the way to carrier. the bigger battleship would only provide a distraction to keep your training and money from focusing on the carrier you specified was the primary goal. what the big battleship would be good for... if it could work well in a fight and would be a cheeper, easier to train option than a full-blown carrier then it may add spice to subcapital gang skirmishes. imo it should be cyno-able to let it hot-drop on a fight, use remote reps effectively, and a max of 5 drones at a time. i still don't really want them in eve though.my specific grudge is that more and more threads seem to indicate that people who have not been playing as long as most cap pilots are demanding their own cheep and easy to train ship that will let them kill lots of people that have years more training and lots more money invested in their setups than they do. i strongly discourage any flex twords this mentality. why did i play for 4 years to get skills and cash for a carier and a dread for some new guy to get all /flex on me in his baby cap. a new charactor can get every bit of pawnage an older charactor can by simply making friends and operating in groups. 10m isk of destroyers does as much dammage as 1b isk of carier. i know a guy that almost lost his carrier to some destroyers. look up eve-university i think is the name."
"excluding the quote, which i am too lazy too read...i see no mention of an actual fix to the issue of drones...just some whining about warlinks...but on the subject of drones, i beleive the curse is a drone boat, typhoon also has a siezeable bay..i'm sure theres more, i'm just too lazy too find them. therefore i call false advertising...and thumbs down."
"thank you for the response. mostly i wanted something that was worth training heavy drones, sentry drones, or di5 for caldari as only 1 ship gets 75m3 of bay and the other 2 bs only get 50m3. i also wanted a ship that i could use before i had to invest the 1 bil in skill books before a carrier. i am training logistics v currently so it seems to be good enough until you get capital reps. my biggest problem is that my drake with warlink's isn't that useful in fleet engagements with its horrid dps. this ship would likely let me solve all three problems but i mostly posted here to get other's opinions on it so thank you.was trying to fit something into the 100m bs slot and the 1 bil cap ship slot."
"caldari don't use drones as a primary weapon, or even as a secondary. drones are more of an afterthought on caldari ships. you want drones, train gallente or amarr, both of whom have some very nice droneships."
"that being exactly the point the op is making.as caldari there is no previous ship that really uses drones so one can 'smooth' the transition to a caldari carrier.might be interesting to have a ship that has some small specific sentry drones (sticking to the caldari 'range' theme) bonus or something along those line.though if this is the case for the other two races.. hmmm. let's call this a 'partial thumbs up'"
"so will anything ever be done with the macros? or has that been forgotten since that gap has been filled with buying time cards with isk? i think a good way would be to put more of the doing in the hands of the players.......if someone thinks there might be a macro miner around he could go and purches a kill rights if the macro is verified as one with a quick check up and then person that bought the kill right can go and pop him. put in your comments or ideas about this."
"that's a really bad solution to macros. if someone has been verified as a macro, you ban them, you don't shoot them. and if you think you've found one, you petition them, you don't purchase kill rights."
"i have petitioned many times about believed macros and have never been sent anything to let me know if they looked into it other then \"thank you for the petition\" and seen the same people keep on doing what they were doing. it would be nice if you got some conformation saying yea they were or not they weren't. whats the point of taking your time letting ccp know about it if it does not seem they are really looking into it."
"ccp doesn't just instaban the person as soon as you petition them; they perform background checks, and with the gigantic queue of names they receive every day, i am sure they are just behind a little.gms and devs have said, in other threads, that despite not showing any immediate reaction; to please, continue petitioning any macro miners you suspect. it does help them.not signed. sorry."
"you should be a student.anyways, i'm in favor of you paying more so i don't have to. also another guy pointed out that you can skimp on your payments by laundering your money into us currency so that should work allright if you want to save. i feel for ya on that vat thing though.. thumbs down to that."

"i think that fully working political parties need to be made in all honesty.actual, working political parties - this would give a lot of angry players a voice they need. i don't think anyone has done this yet, maybe it's about time we start. this is a strong topic, that a lot of people are in discontent about - it would be one of many issues that could found the first political party in eve.this would also assist csm in knowing what the actual views of players are, not just what they think people want, wither it's a valid or flawed perception of the community as a whole, it would help with things - people will be heard, and we won't have stupid changes made to the game that people in reality did not even want in the first place.seriously- if there is a active player at all, who has argued on this topic in detail, has the the time and energy to found this party, and recruit members to sign up to this party, i personally will be one of the first to join this party, and i will go out of my way to help get things off the ground, and/or act as a strategic consultant/research assistant - which i'm very good at. here is not even 5-mins of raw, un-refined concepts of what i had in mind, that i would offer to the chairman of the party. a lot of basic, but this is a game so it has to be adapted differently, and even we have cool tools you can't have in real life:basic tools:-website-chain of command (a chairman, and his/her cabniet, and spokesmen who speak for the party - wither it be to the public, or formally to csm)-in-game mailing list-in-game sign-up channel-recruitment campaigns (i don't know if ccp would allow it or not, but member scould donate isk - which the party could pay to persons who work for the party to search and find like-minded persons who will sign up)-in-game corporation (in line with recruiting ideas to pay members to recruit for the party - where donations are banked and payments are issued)founding a party-first and foremost a chairman has to be found, and a list of very eligible and proper candidates must be found and invited - the cabinet needs to be formed, some form of party charter needs to be written - which i am pretty good at doing too.-the charter document will define the roles of each cabneit member, or appointed members who perform more hands-on roles for the party. the charter would also define the mission statement of the party, and a time line (to-do list) the party will use as a guideline.-the first issue on the time line would obviously be organization, the second step would be building the parties membership, and to refine/tweak party mechanics so it keeps working without any problems.-the list goes on but i don't want to be a consultant for the wrong people.i'm absolutely sure that this will work, and this would likely be a very large party with a strong voice - if set up properly. keep in mind that most political consultant's, at least the good ones, tend to not offer services to a broken-cause.some people will obviously be threatened by this and shoot this idea down obviously, that's politics - but once it's started up, these attacks will cease - at least until they decide to make their own party and try to prevent the spread of influence and organization that may threaten their grip on things.tons of parties could be made really - that i am sure of, but this would probably be a strong topic to start with; eventually when we find other topics we all agree on, we can add these problems on the party bio."
"there is a vast array of issues a party could cater to - wither it be popular issues about lag, blobs, griefing, suicide bombers, macro-miners, rmt'rs, nanos, ecm, and so on. csm politics is brand new - in anything, the strongest and greatest groups are the first ones to get into the business of it all. let's get something going before opposition beats us to the punch.if a brave soul who meets the requirements i placed to be a strong chairman, please contact me at some point - preferably by eve-mail, and we'll arrange some discussion later. you may wonder why i'm not founding a party.well: my most useful place is as a consultant and a strategic adviser/architect more than anything. my strong points/patience are not as much as a charismatic leader/diplomat who is a people-magnet, especially because i've only been involved in eve for a little over 2 years now - about a year less than where i would need to be to found something this important. my strong points are more in the lines of making moves 3-steps ahead of opposing parties on the political map, i'm great at finding oppositions vulnerabilities and creating a means to use that as well. my most notable use would probably be as a architect, planner, administrator, and all and all a builder of things. any builder, engineer, or artist, has great love and pride for their work. i'm also open-minded and able to advise my chairman before any regrettable moves are made that could come to haunt the party later; i can help ensure with other cabinet members, the the party makes significant moves that will not hurt us. i also am a master deception, and am well capable at seeing hidden moves by our opponents before they are made. though, by moral standards, i don't play dirty politics - at least until the opponent does so first, then i am not longer bound by these rules and i'll provide the party a political-killmail if you will.csm politics are a organizational-mess atm in all honesty. parties would help in this reason, and people can actually discuss problems directly and constructively now - instead of the current forum threads full of flames/trolls commentary instead of college-level discussion."

"in the reasonably distant past ecm modules were fitted to all kinds of ships and were quite effective. then ecm modules themselves were nerfed so they became impractical on non-ecm bonused ships. then much later most ecm bonused ships were boosted to make them more useful using the lower starting strength ecm.in a recent patch rsds were changed in two ways, they were reduced to 2/3 of their previous effectiveness and they were given scripts so they affect only one of two aspects to full strength or both to half strength. i'm not arguing that this was a bad change as it wasn't. rsds were being fitted to all sorts of ships (rapiers, ravens, domis etc.) making them similar to ecms of yore.however now the rsd bonused ships are a bit lacking just like the ecm boats used to be. they cannot keep a single target from doing damage like a falcon can or even like a pilgrim can to a turret based ship. i ask that the bonuses to rsd ships be looked at to make them more useful in small gangs. a strength boost returning them to pre-nerf strength on those ships would not be overpowered given the scripting changes."

"dreads:revelation and moros have massive cap use. nag uses no cap for guns. they need more cap mods than nag. usually dread fit to be cap stable with 3 guns + 1 cap rep to avoid lag. that is a massive disadvatage for caldari. nags do not shield tank. for example, go to ra killboard, look up at nag losses. on the first page of dread losses, all nags are armor tanked. so all the talk about fittings is wrong.shield tanking needs a rank 4 100% useless skill(unlike missile skills) to be at level 5. moros needs t2 sentry drones to make the most out of it. hardest training times? most likely, but only slightly.carrier:you mention that the stats are better for thanatos, but if you actually look at the differences you will see that nidhoggur performs very similar compared to other carriers, hardly anything to whine about. remote rep bonus is not bad at all.supercaps: .....ok, the minmatar capitals are not the very best of all, but they are decent. no one will ever say to a minmatar spec char to train some other race's capitals. minor boosts to nid/nag such as bigger armor hp at the expense of shield hp or a slight increase for capital projectile(5%-10%?) is ok and understandable, but major boosts such as adding slots are not required."
"you can armor tank your nag, but then it does even less damage than a shield tanking one (i believe it becomes on par or below the phoenix) and you have less effective hp. in any fleet battle the dreads tank is rather meaningless, you just have to hope your siege deactivates so the carriers can remote rep you up because your tank isn't going to work on more than 1 other dread. in fact if you look at ra's latest nag loss, it's 3 revelations and they only did 1.1mil damage to him.just because someone does it differently it doesn't make it right. if you would like i could rewrite the original post with armor tanking and apart from lowering the training time ~25days for tactical shield manipulation v the nag would be even more ****tier. atleast with the moros's t2 sentries you get to use that on other ships, when was the last time you used torps (which the nag requires ontop of capital projectiles)? a high sec gank is about all they're good for, or maybe cyno jammer takedowns.as a minmatar character through and through, and as much as i love my tempest, i would tell any newbie to stop training minmatar at cruisers and to not even bother with anything bs and above. they are outclassed and outshined by every other race in capitals and battleships. the nidhoggur/hel are okay, but they're not worth being stuck with terrible battleships/dreads/titans."

"lol at all the carebear fgts"
"you don't need to cancel insurance or make kill rights tradeable. that is just a band-aid on the issue. keep in mind if you are going to suicide gank, and you know you're not going to get insurance why insure it to begin with.so the insurance isk sink is removed from gankers. this is no good either, although it's a small isk sink it's a sink none the less. let them keep the insurance, don't even worry about tradable kill rights.what really needs to happen is the frequency in which someone could gank.you know someone could suicide gank 92 times in a day... that's far too many, potential suicides. i would much rather see the outlaw timer last an hour.this also forces gankers to be more choosy when it comes to targets, and being an outlaw for an hour drastically cuts down the amount of ganks they can perform, but it still gives them the opportunity and motive to do it.if they have the balls they can sit on a gate with global countdown and defend themselves from people attacking them. a group of circle jerking remote shield repping ravens can tank gate guns, so the can still do exactly what they want, they just need to devote more effort to their cause.if they are solo gankers, they must be more selective on their targets, so it works there too. also when you consider what effort it would take to implement this for ccp.change the timer from 15 minutes, to 60 minutes, but make it so you only get 60 minutes if done in high sec. low sec, remove the agro timer completely.so i'd support, removal of timer in low sec, increase the timer in high-sec.the reason i'd support removal of low sec timer is simply to make ganking in low sec more attractive vs high sec. if you don't want a global counter for 60 minutes go camp a low sec gate."

"why not just take the sp in learning skills atm and let you reassign it from the web to new skills? then give everyone +7-9 for all attributes. i have learning trained to 9 atm. most people train tehm to at leas 7 or 8. the +10 people would suddenly get 5m sp to throw into anything else they wanted anyway. alternatively you could have an extra 2 - 10 skill points from the learning pool tick off every second in addition to your current learning until the sp from the pool was depleted in game. this will at least make people log in to change skills still without instantly giving them bs v without in game training time. then do the same with the attribute bump.the difference is players can grief and scam other players. ccp should not as there is no way to defend against them greifing you. (ignoring lag issue )edit also if you did the second idea with the newbie builds that come with learning skills. they could learn those first skills much much faster."
"regarging the issue about \"don't steal from experienced players without compensation\": don't remove learning skills. give new characters the learning skills (at 4/4) right away. nothing taken away from the vets, only added to the rookies.not supporting this idea. i'm ambivalent about the learning skills; getting them to 4 takes less than a week, and you can fly a frig easily until then, learning the game. then you earn isk, get the advanced skills and train them to 3, which is also ok. my main problem with learning skills is not that they're such a big problem, but rather that they don't actually add anything to the game, except wait time, which is a bit problematic.actually, i do think that the whole attribute thing needs a revamp.remove starting attribute differences. yes, no more uber-achura and lol-whatever.every race starts with all attributes at 8. after that, only learning skills (invested time) and implants (risked isk) affect the attributes.bloodline and ancestry affect your starting learning skills. say, two learning skills start out at 4, two more at 3, remaining one at 2. this would mean that a new player can dive into their preferred area right away, and just need a few days to bring up the remaining areas to 4 if you want to broaden their horizon, too. advanced learning skills can be trained up when isk allows, retaining the time+isk now vs. time+isk later choice. (i wouldn't mind just starting out at 12 or so, and not having advanced learning skills, but as said above, i'm ambivalent about that)"
"don't support. as a fairly new player myself (just over three months) i find nothing wrong with them. if people are unable to decide by themselves whether learning skills are or are not a good investment for their plans then why on earth are they playing a game that is all about various risks and costs versus rewards?"
"i definitely support this.abolish learning skills, give everyone +10 to all stats, reimburse the skillpoints from people who trained the learning skills."
"i agree that something needs to be done about local channel, how about a delay on appearing in local, say 10 seconds and also cloaked ships dont appear on local unless the pilot speaks. that would allow stealth ships to enter the system and cloak without detection, they would then need to stay close to entry point until they know where they are going, then de cloak to warp to wherever they are going thereby becoming visible and in so giving at least a short warning to everyone in system that you are there.a cloaked ship should be undetectable, ie you shouldnt know it is there! with you appearing in local, everyone knows your there. however possibly some sort of advanced scanner could be implemented that can detect cloaked ships, maybe just for recons or something, since they are supposed to be intel gathering ships.but anyway everyone just appearing in local channel is something i believe should change in some way."

"it's destructible. just take it off them. exactly the same effect as destroying it.i'm seeing alot of star fraction pilots posting about how \"anything should be destructible\" but seeing very little else. do you actually have anything to add to the debate as to why destruction is superior to denial for the game, or are you just posting because you're told to?sad when the discussion can be bombarded (20% of the posts in this topic are from sf members, and a fair chunk from noob corps alts, including this char) with supportive opinion and it actually look to be the dominant opinion, despite the actual low level of real discussion and debate goin on. highlights how many people really give a toss about what the csm is trying to do. though that's something for another [issue]."
"goumindong speaks for most goons. you allow destructible outposts and we will try and **** everyone just long enough to blow up there systems. we are already huge and have sold off 1 entire region. when we backed off from bob due to just getting sick of it we would have blown up every outpost on our way out that we could have. also we would do the same to smash. we are there for better kills and because fighting bob was a grind nightmare on morale. geminate will get the giant reset buttan if this goes through. smaller alliances would be completely screwed. if we don't want their space now we leave it alone. give goons the chance to grief a permanent 20b isk asset and it will be gone. jihadswarm proves goons grief in gross proportion to the isk they can game from it already."
"this is a stupid idea and your reasons for implementing it are flawed. some people have been complaining about there being too many 0.0 outposts in january 2006 but you can't dispute that more 0.0 conflict has been good for eve in general. your claim that there needs to be a cost to losing a territory war is pretty horrible considering that surely losing your territory is enough of a cost. eve is supposed to be a sandbox game where the player's determine the consequences for actions and here you are asking in various ways for in built consequences to be implemented (this covers your wardec ideas as well as this and other ideas)."
"since you're going to be bringing this up in csm whether we support it or not, can we at least get some of the other reps' opinions itt?"
"i don't support this idea in its current form. done properly, it might have merit, but letting people just run around blowing up outposts is a sure way to let the big alliances grief the crap out of the little ones. several goons have already admitted they'll do it if this gets implemented. there definitely needs to be more debate and less 'yes/no' on this issue before it goes in.from my perspective, destroying an outpost should be nearly impossible. alexander noir flew a mothership into a station and didn't even knock it offline, though he did mess it up real bad. and what is an outpost but a station built by players, after all? destroying an outpost also denies the players of that alliance all the assets they had stored there without proper provisions. or does it? how long does an outpost wreck remain for? forever, like titan wrecks? for a limited time? how much firepower does it take to destroy an outpost? something that expensive should require a similarly expensive fleet to bring down at all, surely? wouldn't requiring it to take a lot of damage ensure that it's merely going to be used by the massive alliances that have the capital fleets to do it? but if it takes too little damage won't you get people running around in subcapitals doing it for fun? what effect does a destroyed outpost have on deploying another outpost? what conditions determine when an outpost can be attacked? how is an outpost going to defend itself? and most importantly, how is this good for the game?i want to see answers to these questions before i see any proposal this big get forced down ccp's throat by an overzealous csm demagogue. it's also worth noting that the 0.0 space closest to star fraction's traditional base of operations has one of the highest concentrations of outposts in the game."
"i fully support the idea of destructible outposts. eve lives of the fact that you can lose everything. indestructible player made outposts are just not in the spirit of the game.the life in 0.0 became a whole lot easier by all the outposts right around the corner, offering all the infrastructure you will ever need. which makes it a lot easier for alliances to hold vast amounts of space.safe hangars, where the stored equipment might be inaccessible at a point, but it is not destroyed or looted by the enemy, which would happen if it is stored at a pos. another issue is the easier way to split jumpclones over a larger area of space for tactical purposes."
"how can you say no to bigger explosions ?"
"c."
"i agree outposts should be destructible as they are an obvious target in a war or a hit and run raid."
"i think you need to discount the goons \"admitting\" they'd use this functionality to \"grief\" to be honest. i honestly don't think there is any such thing as \"grief-play\" in 0.0 - its an open pvp area and anybody doing anything in 0.0 is actively inviting other players to oppose them and blow up their stuff. putting down an outpost is no different from flying about in a pimped mothership - its inviting attack and destruction should be allowed on principle. +seriously. goon posters complaining that destructible outposts would make \"griefing\" too easy? who buys that argument really if destructible outposts really would be a \"griefers paradise\" then you'd see the goons dancing in the streets in support. the reality is that destructible outposts will hurt the large 0.0 powers a lot because they will have to take each and every territorial challenge to their vast holdings with the utmost seriousness. they won't have the option (they have today) of simply ignoring certain attacks on the grounds they can always take back the outposts later on when they can clear time on the schedules. real significance to threat means the large alliances will have to make hard choices on resource and military allocation and hard choices are currently completely lacking from territorial empire building in 0.0.the opposition from the goon-posters on this issue is not on the grounds of some woolly-eve-centric anti grief agenda. its because they are worried the status quo (where they are amongst the ascendant) will change to their detriment in an environment where they could face multiple territorial challenges simultaneously that resolve in significant loss of fixed holdings."
"get rid of those blinds jade ... goons are right.if outposts become fully destructible, nobody will be able to set them up unless they are sure they can defend them or the expense is not much for them.this means only large alliances.scorched space tactics goons mentioned are extremenly effective against smaller entities, where the loss is felt much more. the larger alliance either abandons the space or rebuilds as they have resources for that. one outpost out of 20 lost is not much, but one out of 3-4 is a serious setback."
"0.0 handholding is bad. i see no problem with outpost owners losing it all. i am sure ccp can figure something out and i definately want them to take a serious look at it. i fail to see how goonswarm or any other can \"grief\" anyone in eve using legal gamemechanics."
"the concern is the escalating barrier to entry into 0.0. nobody is saying that it should never happen. just that the reasoning and proposed implementation is flawed.new 0.0 alliance a puts up its first 2 outposts. a refinery and faction outpost. they control 2 constellations and in time could become a significant force to pew pew with/against. large alliance, bob or swarm, comes in and deploys cap and super cap fleet for a week, takes sov, sets outpost to blow up, and leaves. after a couple times only 2 or 3 major alliances with massive power will be left because smaller alliances just can't stand up to a cap blob.it is true. i am a horrible goon. i don't grief or scam. they only keep me around cause of the months i took training ark, bis, scrap to v and get the h60 implant. thanks jade. now i feel even more terrible about myself."
"you have an existing, actual mega-alliance, with many many players, tell you that they will do this if this gets implemented, and you want to discount it? everything else in this thread and many of the other [issues] and proposals are just theorycrafting, calculations of what might happen and how the playerbase might react, and maybe the predictions are right, maybe they're wrong, who knows. we can all discount and argue and reason and provide counter-arguments, as long as it's just theorycrafting.but when an actual group of players tells you \"this is what we'll do\", you're gonna discard that? wtf?!?!no, i do not want the goddamn goons to burn my outposts to the ground, mr. representative of the community. please make sure it doesn't ****ing happen."
"well, since jade has chosen not to address my point that it has yet to be proven that the risk/reward of 0.0 is out of balance (because it isn't imho). let's assume the community agrees that everything player built should be explode-able (which while a totally valid opinion, also has not been proven to be held by a majority of the community: see high-sec ganking threads). what happens to npc stations in 0.0? assuming they stay indestructible, they provide a safe base for the defender. also, not all 0.0 space has npc stations, and some have more than others. how do you propose to \"level the playing field\" for strategic value of npc stations?"
"everything buildable should be destructible. i had thought they were until now.this idea is worthy of more discussion."
"every time a station system is being attacked we'd swarm to protect it no matter what. look at gq2-, the second they started dropping towers there we where there sieging them. you don't ever \"ignore\" an attack on a system station, you're going to want it back there's no reason to give them a foothold.this would only be used in areas like geminate where we really didn't want it and would only really keep the stations if they made a sov4 cons that we could sell or something (or it was a system where we knew we where going to lose it like when qy6 was being sieged at the end of the delve offensive)."
"discussion yes. the current proposed idea has huge wholes in it. i would not support the thread as is but would give a thumbs up to a more generalized \"we need to look at way that this can happen\" thread."
"this is from the conclusion of the op and this is what i support discussing further."
"it is not griefing if jade constantine blow up my spaceship, it is not griefing when bob doomsdays our fleet, and it is not griefing when an outpost get captured, how can the destruction of any asset in a free fire pvp zone be regarded in any shape way or form as griefing."
"i agree with destructable outposts in principle. the implimentation would have to be considered very carefully.nothing players build should be invulnerable. at the moment outposts are forever, even if their owners are not, and this is wrong."
"yep, because what they say will happen is not what will happen.yep, just i like discard most boasts made by 0.0 entities on caod actually. csm is for discussing gameplay and eve ooc issues not getting bent out of shape by nonsense bravado from 0.0 alliance people. sorry, its not my job to make your 0.0 holdings invulnerable. don't fly what you can't afford to lose. don't build what you can't afford to see burned to the ground. thats eve."
"yes.ccp ...remove / revise the stacking penalties especially on short range variantschange damage modifiers to balanceinvestigate adding other effects to t2 ammo instead of damage"
"i almost never use t2 ammo.and i do like my share of sniper ships.tech1/faction ammo benefits outweigh the penalties for t2 ammo."
"i agree t2 ammo needs to be reviewed and redone. i'd like to see microwarp drive propelled missiles as the t2 variant. these missiles would scream across space but only fly for a couple of seconds (limited capacitor power in a missile). this alone isn't a solution but it would provide a marked difference between the missile tiers and more ideas are welcome."

"not the perfect numbers in my eyes, but certainly an idea with legs. not only will it break the dock/undock cycle, but it works on an rp/backstory level. the more dangerous a ship(especially with war breaking out), the more cautious the sation owners are about letting it dock. or perhaps a scale/stacknerf. first dock/undock/engage cycle = 30 seconds, next = 1min, next 2min and so on. reduces the effectiveness of the tactic. without punishing people who are genuinely fleeing a superior force with no intention of re-engaging. even if neither of these ideas come to fruition, it's something that needs to be looked at, npc's should not offer such effective tactical support to pvp'ers."

"[issue] i trained caldari industrial v before i realized they had terrible haulers"
"my dear fellow, i appreciate that you are trying to troll me, but nevertheless:i trained caldari industrial 5, around 2 and a half years ago. this was a time when interdictors, heavy interdictors, and medium and large bubbles didn't exist. there were also no ships with a warp disruptor range bonus. at the time, therefore, the odds of 'being in a bubble' on jump in were significantly lower, since you needed a _lot_ of small bubbles to cover that 12km jump in sphere, and it was possible to spot one on your exit vector with the system scanner. tactical bookmarking such that you didn't use the 'obvious' insta vectors, meant that you could quite reasonably avoid trouble. it was therefore much less relevant, that a ship had trouble fitting a microwarp drive, and therefore the crane and it's bigger brother the bustard were really quite acceptable as t2 haulers go.it's telling that since then, these ships have remained unchanged, and the gameplay has evolved, which has lead to the disparity between this one, and it's fellows. hence this post."

"this seems like a good idea to me. especially in a system where your number of auctions is limited, it would be handy to be able to free up spots when a bid gets high. after all, i know after posting an auction i have sometimes rethought how much i should have set the buyout for, and this effectively allows you a limited degree of freedom in that regard."
"look at the way ebay does auctions. why can i not give a maximum bid amount at the beginning? why not a buy out, or as arcadian suggests let the seller take a bid amount early? selling, auctions etc are in many ways the heart of the economy of eve and should be given serious consideration and developement time."

"you must not have read the economic reports on this topic. the caps are not on the price of end goods but the price of minerals. the most common limiter for tritanium used to be a shuttle, which capped at 3.6 isk. the reason there was a cap is you could buy shuttles and reprocess them into trit. the amount of trit you got back you could then sell on the market. since the prices of shuttles is static this puts an artificial cap on the price of trit, because why would you pay more when you can buy shuttles in unlimited numbers and reprocess them rather than paying the higher price.recent shuttles were removed from being sold by npcs removing that particular item as a cap, but since people have discovered many other items which you can do the same thing.the idea i am suggesting would eliminate the static price of materials and end goods thus making the market more subjective to local (regional) supply and demand."
"my first problem with this is a module sold by npcs gets undervalued in 1 region. say somewhere like molden heath or khanid with large low sec areas. the reason for this is simple. most people with very large isk amounts don't want to risk a freighter through multiple low sec gates for cheaper trit and sell low in the low sec systems.now you can get a freighter and bring the items from the high sec systems in the region with artificially reduced trit prices and dump loads and loads into a refinery and get even more tweaked caps. since you would have the price of trit low there would be permanent abuse in these systems. furthermore it opens the potential in 0.0 pirate sov for mins to be purposely lowered on an alliance level to permanently keep these items at less than 1 isk/trit ratio in this system. simply tell everyone to buy the item and reprocess and you have total npc supplied minerals. this works for all npc items and thus all minerals that can be gotten from npc items.i like the idea in theory but this implementation is highly susceptible to abuse."

"a realistic economic system? say it ain't so!can we also do away with static prices on anything and everything? npc buy/sell orders which run out/expire, thereby reinforcing supply and demand? hauler spawns in empire? factional warfare, for instance, could do a lot of things to prices of goods or materials, but i doubt anyone up at ccp makes those sorts of connections. maybe they should hire an economist.edit: fyi, you can support your own thread."
"not only do i read the econblogs and qens, i actually get excited about them, god help me. i find this stuff fascinating, and i watch it as closely as i can. the reason i mentioned end-good prices(i.e., ships) is that the insurance system as it stands now over-insures ships based on artificial valuations(trit=2, pyer=8, mex=32, iso=128, nocx=512, zyd=2048, mega=8192, morph=32768) to the point where it creates a price floor on minerals as a group. right now, mineral markets are only about 5% above that floor, and that's one of the biggest reasons i proposed an idea of how to fix insurance a while back. not only does it artificially distort the market, it also makes losing a ship way too cheap, leading to a large part of the suicide gank market we have today. however, my point was that, aside from the insurance problem that i've already seen a lot of proposed fixes to, there aren't really a lot of price caps out there that i'm aware of. shuttles weren't a cap, they just looked like they had the possibility to become one, and so they were removed preemptively(that, and because ccp doesn't want npcs and pcs selling the same goods on market). if more exist, then i'm all for their removal - artificial distortions of the market are bad, i'll agree with you on that. i'm just not sure where those distortions are at the moment. care to enlighten me?"
"it always bugged me that there wasnt really a benefit of fitting the larger guns sizes. most of the dps advantage is lost in the falloff. also the ability to overheat webs and mwd's has made fighting in falloff harder and harder."
"any honest statistical treatment of this topic is next to impossible without belching out a staggering amount of data. not only would one have to quantify the relative value of disparate strengths and weaknesses such as tracking vs optimal vs falloff vs ammo damage vs cap usage, etc. you would have to wrap all that up into the larger set of variables that is the ships themselves. thats why these arguments go all wonky. that being said, im not even going to attempt to spew a bunch of numbers, im just going to state the issue as i see it.there is a problem with autocannos, and not just large ones, but it is hard to address that issue without rethinking minmatar ships altogether. the problem is you have to throw ship bonuses, rigs, and/or damage mods at them to make them effective. on top of that you generally have to use barrage. no other weapon system requires so much extra help to simply function viably.they simply were designed to compete in a very different iteration of eve, and too much has to now be scarified to them to make them work well. this stretches well into minmatar ship design.also, gaurm, you are partially correct: the typhoon and maelstrom do function. one works because it does not employ autocannos as a primary weapon system and the other function because it generally devotes 14 slots to making them work (usually 8 high, 3 low, and 3 rig). this should indicate there is a fundamental flaw with autocannos and that ships have to be engineered to overcome that inherent weakness."
"ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. seriously? maybe you should look at pulse lasers[scorch is a requirement as well as rigs, and damage bonuses and cap bonuses and...]. or blasters which in the current situations almost never are valuable no matter what training you have?and large pulse lasers must suck because the apoc has to dedicate 20 slots to make them good!"
"goum. im not going to fence with you: partially because that exactly what you want, regardless of the topic, the opponent, or the validity of your proposition; partially because i think you have a better understand of the game than some people are willing to admit; primarily, though, because this is not a thread about pulse lasers or blaster. i have made no arguments as to the viability of other weapon systems. you are welcome to start posts about how they are overpowered, underpowered, or just right till your hearts content.as i stated before, it is not easy to compare weapon systems based on raw data, as number of relevant and situational variables are staggering.btw, i was not trying to insult you, i was agreeing with you to a certain extent. the typhoon and the maelstrom are function ships. i would propose, however, that the typhoon is not an ac boat. if one fits the ship with three heavy weapon systems (800mm iis, siege iis, and ogre iis); acs will produce the least amount of damage by a significant amount. if you were to add damage mods, you would gain the most benefit by adding bcus. this hardly qualifies the typhoon as an ac boat."
"everything can only be valued relatively. if you are going to say something is \"hard to train for\" or \"needs more work to be viable\" then that must mean \"its hard to train for compared to the alternatives\" and \"it needs more work to be as viable as all the others\".and its just not true. they aren't really any harder to train for than anything else. blasters for low-sec small gang work maybe. but not lasers or a complete missile set.its irrelevant if it performs with them[and it does]. and the maelstrom is an ac boat, and performs well with them.there are some problems with ac's regarding things that can be done to make them more new character friendly(falloff bonus on the long range tech 1 ammo), and there are things that can be done to make the tech 2 ammo a bit more reasonable(nix the optimal penalty on hail), but there is no fundamental problem with auto cannons that need fixing. just a (small) fundamental problem with the tempest."
"herschel yamamoto, care to link a killboard where we can see what kind of experience you have with pvp? you're clearly nothing more than a clueless eft warrior, your tempest and typhoon fits are hilarious. if you think the tempest is a beast, that's just precious.goum: par for the course as far as you are concerned. same stupid **** over and over. i don't know why marn wastes his time arguing with you, because nothing has ever made the slightest dent in that thick head of yours.large projectiles need to be looked at."
"minmatar bs with autocannons simply cannot compete with other ships. if they could then you would see a lot more autopests in gangs. you don't. the maelstrom was not designed for autocannons, it is a fleet artillery ship. that makes its active tank even more of a crime. for a true gunships, this ship has some ordinary features like its lack of agility and speed.for those that say an 8% differential in speed is significant for the pest; try running away from a blasterthron in a pest. see how long you last .....large autocannons need loving; i believe in the form of a tracking boost with ammo tweaking.the pest needs an agility and speed boost. it tanks like a wet blanket compared to its peers so give it the ability to run away."
"if you read the information regarding how the csm works and topics for discussion, you will see clearly the following:1. all topics have to be presented here, in this forum, for a period of 7 days before being able to be discussed/voted on by the csm.2. each player is only allowed to present one issue- here, 60+ issues are being presented together. i see no mention of a csm member being exempt from this one topic limit. they can support as many issues as they like. however, each issue on the pdf and start of this thread needs to be proposed on the thread by a different player, discussed for 7 days etc.the purpose of seperating them all out is clearly there are some issues that are not in the interests of the industralist player. having them all voted on together just doesn't make sense, and is not what the csm council was designed to do.take care,arithron"

"they were 20m, they're now 10m, if they were about 5m i figure they would be about right, i can see why taking this in small steps has been a good idea, but surely by now we'd have seen the effect of the previous price drop/boost."
"makes sense.tt"
"i agree w/ what inanna said. however, i am not neutral. i'm against this proposal for the exact same reasons that inanna is neutral for it. in my opinion, if the elected chair can not perform his/her duties then the chair position should follow the order of popular vote from the pod pilots. neither the csm nor ccp should ever be able to call for a vote that changes who holds any csm position without letting the pod pilots vote. making this change would essentially destroy what ccp is trying to create.the suggestions outlined by grismar would be an effective way of selecting new chair, however i stand by the belief that the vote should not be internal but presented to the general community."
"no. i think our votes should mean something. the council doesn't need more power."
"so you don't think the council should effectively be able to elect who they want to plan meetings and moderate discussion?i mean, if someone does get elected for chair, but this individual doesn't have the time nor will to do this job, surely he should be able to resign and have a vote put up to replace him?i think this is a sensible idea."
"that's not exactly what jade said, but i can answer that question for you, too: if you're not able to run for csm, don't run for csm. it's a large responsibility, and some people have jobs or school or a family. i can understand that. if you can't handle being a csm, then don't run. you can still vote as a public member and push stuff through the forums, but if you don't \"have the time nor will to do this job\", then quit and let the person with the second-most votes lead the council.anyway, since you didn't read it the first time, let me copy/paste for you:basically, if enough people felt strongly enough about your campaign to vote for you the most, then you deserve to be the chairman. i do not feel that the council should have the power to vote internally for that seat."
"you aren't quite getting the point i'm making. i fully agree with you that you shouldn't run if you don't have time. but some people do run, because of a free trip to iceland.also, i read jades post and i have discussed this matter with him several times. i'm just adding my perspective to it. so stop assuming i didn't read the thread because i don't make the same points as jade.but let me ask you. do you think that the person with the most votes will always want, or is able to, moderate and plan meetings?"
"yeah, i get that feeling too...that is entirely the wrong reason to run (are you naming any names...?) but i understand what you're saying. i don't believe that people who garner enough votes are those types of people though; i believe the people who made the top 9 votes put a lot of effort into their campaigns, and into the game as well.i only said that because you didn't respond to what i said. you were talking about something completely different, so i wanted to make sure we were on the same page...i apologize if i offended you.the person with the most votes is the person that the people feel is most capable for the position. that is what i am saying. what this thread is suggesting is that the people cede that power to the council. that is what i am against. anyone who applies for csm, regardless of vote count, should want, or be able to, read the csm charter and figure out what the roles of the council are, should they be appointed.example one: if you have nine people who think they should each be chairman, you run into problems.example two: there are a lot of people who are disappointed or upset or angry that members from goonfleet are appointed csm membership positions. they could force the csm to do lots of things most of their \"constituents\" don't agree with, and i don't believe it is in our best interests to allow the council to have more power than they already have."
"not at all. the person with the most votes is the person whom most people wanted on the council.wanting someone to be on the council is not the same as wanting someone to be the chair.it certainly says nothing about how willing or capable that person would be for the chair position."
"motion supported.thats a great candidate for the first vote and validates the chairperson in the csm councils eyes.also instills some faith in me that csm may make a difference for the better."
"agreed, i never voted for the chair when i cast my vote, i only voted for the person that best represented my views on eve."
"yes, you did. didn't either of you read the rules before you voted? guess not, huh. this isn't a us-style system of voting, so i guess i'm not surprised most of you aren't familiar with it."
"i cant say i share this feeling as a voter, i have little idea who will come first nor can i know if the first person past the post will make the best chair. although it makes sense to have a temporary chairperson to get business underway it is common practice for the board to vote in senior board members based on their ability.i still stand by the fact i voted for the person who best represented my outlook on eve, anyone else feel this way?are you a mind reader?1) indeed before i voted, i read some of the \"council of stellar management\" document (i admit to speed reading the waffle to get to the important bits) including this section from page 9 which those who read the rules are familiar with.the council structure\"by default, the representative with the highest vote tally is awarded with the responsibilities of chairman for the csm. within three days of the general election, the representatives must hold an internal vote to determine a vice-chairman, secretary, and vice-secretary. failure to hold this vote, or if the vote is inconclusive, awards <U+FFFD>granting<U+FFFD> authority to the chairman, who may then appoint council members to the other positions as he or she sees fit. if the chairman decides to step down or rescind his responsibility during this time for any reason, a vote must be held among representatives to replace him.\"apart from an attempt started by jades post circa 22/05/08 -"

"because its the best sniper."
"so can someone show me a real solo kill by a falcon against anything that might be anything than a afk floating brick?rapiers..solo kills all of the time, arazu's they suck but they do get solo kills, and the amamar one what ever it is can get solo kills. the rook as far as dps sucks compared to any of the three other races of combat and force recon. so it looks like it has a role and the only time you can actually use the damn thing is for a gang. the other three can work independently or in a gang. the falcon/rook can not."
"all the recons should be able to kill anything up to cruisers. anything bigger then that and you will need a curse/pilgrim. (ofc it depends a lot on shiptype and how the ship is setup, but im thinking in general)i dont think the dps is relevant for any of the force recons, if you want a cruiser that deals dps you go with a combat recon or hac. the reason you choose a force recon is because of its cov ops cloak and ew bonus. the force recons is support ships and i dont think they should be balanced based on their \"solo performance\". maybe the rook could use a dps buff, but that is another discussion."
"it's not quite that straightforward. caldari ewar boats are like they are (paper thin) due to the requirements of fitting sdas in the lowslots to get most out of your jammers. or at least that was the design intent when they were introduced. other recons have plenty of low- and rigslots available for armor or speed tank: nanorapiers or nanocurses are not that uncommon at all. otoh, rest of the recons are actually multirole ships (or can be fitted that way pretty easily). rr-rapier is heavily armortanked, as is rr-arazu, including plates, trimarks and hardeners. that does not limit their ew-capablities, however - in falcon's case it does.in a sense, bringing a falcon \"in line\" with rest of the recons won't really work: their abilities are very different and comparing them to each other isn't really fair. if falcon had similar capabilities to shut down ships as an arazu, it'd be the underdog already: the falcon would have to use all it's lowslots to achieve the same effect (and rigslots as well in the case of 200km falcon) due to the need of fitting sdas. without sdas, i'm pretty sure the falcons would be pretty much in line with rest of the recons in terms of ewar ability - but with crappier bonuses to achieve what it's supposed to do. it'd again be just another caldari cruiser nobody flies because of it's lack of speed and damage. and removing sdas entirely just won't work at all, as they were introduced for a reason.however, in a way i feel that we perhaps agree on more issues than we disagree on. we both agree that there is room for improvement but it's a matter of perspective whether that means gimping the falcon or introducing new, more focused, ew ships (this means changing the rest of the recons to focus purely on ew instead of giving them, say, damage bonuses)."
"so you want to nerf a ship because of your lack of preparation ?all you need is a covert ops scout (which you should have anyway) and a ship that stays behind and waits for the falcon to decloak, a sniper bs is ideal.falcons have too few low slots to cover more ships than 2-3 anyway reliable and also cover 200+km ranges. you either loose jammers, jamming power or range and/or sig res (or versatility if you use racial jammers).if he cloaks, he will loose overview of who is jammed and who not and also cycle time and relock time. if he warps out, you have even more time to breathe.it just takes preparation and some imagination. your backup can always join the fight when no falcon shows up in reasonable time and make a nasty surprise for the opposing gang.and a falcon with bookmarks in system deservers his superiority, because he prepared for the fight and you didn't."
"i read through the thread and kept spotting people giving idiotic opinions and moving on to see if anyone responded or i should.i have now reached the end of the thread but i have read so many ridiculous comments that i dont feel up to the task of responding. at least half the people in this thread (on both sides of the argument) should go pvp a bit before they voice their opinions on the forums.regarding the topic... when usedby gatecampers from range falcons are overpowered but this is not that unusual in the time honoured caldari tradition of useless solo and uber in a small gang nad sort of useful in a fleet. 90% of caldari ships are like that.they might seem a bit imba on gates with multiple sniper bms but if sniper fleets were less rare these days they would pop a lot more.i personally would like all ecm removed from eve but my reason is simply i dont like i am not claimign there is a fairness related reason..."
"based on the four force recons, each one receives combat bonuses the falcon does not. the pilgrim, arazu and the rapier can hit dps above 220 and as high as 300+, the falcon might might hit 110 if you compromise the falcons ewar capability. i am trying show the balance of a player able to be effective in gang and solo. the falcon is left out. it is essentially pigeon holed as a support vehicle and that's about it. the only defense the falcon has is the ewar. unlike its counter parts it can not tank with out gimping itself. it does not have drones. it does not receive combat bonuses. it aligns and travels slower than any of the four. it can not give point or web without committing suicide. so basically the falcon is a one trick pony. the others can find uncompromised success in and out of gang."
"so in my small man gang (2-3 people) i should have cov ops prober/scout and a sniper bs. and what should my last ship be that we can actually engage some targets? a titan?i agree that the falcon is limited in what roles it can embrace. however it's 'role' is extremely powerful and fight changing compared to the other force recons, additionally it's still broken in small gang environments.seriosuly, adding stacking penalties and possibly removing off-race jam strength on racial jammers isn't going to weaken the falcon very much at all except in small gang environments where its targets also have eccm. that's perfect, balance it where it's overpowered and leave it alone where it isn't!.if the jam targets don't bring eccm they're still sol. one racial jammer has a 86% chance to jam my geddon if it isn't eccm'd. even with stacking penalties, you're still going to perma jam a bs that doesn't bring eccm. it will just be that, now, if a small gang has eccm, one falcon won't still be able to perma jam everyone just because there are only 2-3 total targets.hurray balance!"
"no.so if the falcon had 2 of its bonuses changed to 20% missile dmg- and 5% shield res per lvl, and a dronebay, you would be happy?in case you havent read the whole thread,, im discussing the scenario where 200km falcons is used as ecm cover for small gangs in low sec."
"strongly disagree with the op.falcons are just fine."
"there's no need for territory holding to \"be a job\" in the sense of a massive time sink. but an entity that claims to \"own space\" should have a player ship presence in that space to maintain that claim. if the population of supposedly held space is more often enemy than ally, that should be reflected in the sovereignty claim."
"what sort of impact will this have on coalition forces that often patrol each others' space, or small alliances patrolling the space of a bigger partner they're allied with?"
"maybe a new sov system could include a way for mercenary and coalition alliances to act on behalf of the territory-holding entity."
"i have been ratting in a -0.97 system using a myrmi recently no probs so not sure if it really needs a boost. though i always felt they should have given it 100 m3 drone b/w and one less turret. so yes."
"the myrmidon is perfectly fine as it is. though i mise the days of it's five heavy drones, it was nerfed for a reason."
"because it was to easy to dismantle?the 5-heavy myrm is so easy to make useless. target it's drones and pop them 1-by-1 and you have 1 dead myrm."
"brutix works for gun boat. if you balanced the myrm around its heavy drones again i don't see a problem. maybe 1 less total high slot and -2/3 turrets. just saying it might be useful to look into. drones have the inherent weakness versus ship turrets of being individually targettable.edit forgot to vote"
"the primary reason the myrmidon was nerfed was because people said it had too high a dps with a full flight of heavies deployed. most myrmidons used ogres for heavy drones. you ever see how slow those things are? just about anything in the game can out run them. if there's any distance to the target, they get the crud shot out of them on the way there.75 m3 bandwidth requires you deploy a mixture of drone sizes to fully utilize it. this creates a problem in timing. larger drones trailing behind in both deployment and retrieval.regards,windjammer"
"i don't think myrm need changes, but if yes, i'd prefer 15-20 m3 bigger dronebay and 5-10 additional mbit/s bandwidth for 2-3 less turrets.you're going to drop one turret anyway for dla, and another one typically going to repper. (hull repper! not armor)-3 turret hardpoints going to be serious kick in the way to be real drone boat. but no changes for slots layout, or it will be another drake. thanks we have enough mindless drakes farming eve in all aspects."
"the myrms in question used blasters and as such were closerange ships for gatecamping etc. range was hardly an issue, and its hard to outrun the ogres when webbed. myrm needed a nerf, but perhaps they should have removed some turrets instead so it stayed a droneboat."

"as it is now the learning skills represent an extreemly steep cost of entry to the game. as a new player i am terribly excited to get into the game and start working toward my goals. i am willing and eager to put in the hard work of becoming a competently skilled pilot, but when the first steps of that work are without direct gameplay rewards, i am unenthusiastic. i propose that the learning skills be something that can be trained after a given amount of relevent directly game affecting skills are trained. this would be coupled with slightly higher attributes for new characters. a given learning skill would become available once a character has trained a certain ammount of skills with that learning skill's primary and secondary attributes. so if a character trained a threshold of gunnery skills they would then get to train the perception and willpower learning skills. this would give the learning skills the role of allowing a pilot to specialise after they have had a good amount of effective game time to decide where to do so without gimping them for putting off their learning skills. i'll admit now that implementing this might be dificult and reimbursement to older players could be an issue but i belive that it will be ccp's job to ballance that."
"/i do not support thisaddressing both points brought up by the op1. learning skills are not extremely steep cost skills. learning skills are 45 thousand isk for the rank 1 skill and 4.5 million isk for the rank 3 one. in no way are these totals even close to being steep. consider the cost of a battleship, 50+ million isk. capitol ship? 1+ billion isk. the majority of players, new and old alike, shouldn't have any trouble making the ~30 mil for these skills within the first month and a half, and that's a generous estimate. i had all of the learning skills within 3 weeks of starting and i paid for them. 2. under no circumstances should any skills, learning or otherwise, become skillpoint sensitive. example; gaining the learning skills as you train in skills that use the attribute. doing this would totally destroy the current skill system, and would require no less than a total overhaul of every charater in the database. no."
"meh, i kinda trained some learning skills, some combat skills, some support skills as i saw needed in the beginning, learning skills were rather low in importance. i also flew into lowsec, and flew ships i couldn't afford to lose (of course not into lowsec, i read the damn warnings). about a month or two in they were 4/3, i was flying a drake completing level 3 missions with no problems, thats when i went for 5/4eves golen rule, don't listen to them blabbering idiots in the nub corp chat."
"as much as i don't like learning skills.........i can see why someone who doesn't have patience to train these not being able to handle the game as a whole.eve is not instantly gratifying, you have to use your head to make some isk. or win in pvp."
"oops wrong toon"
"i got them on a recommendation of a friend, my first friend in eve actually, didn't start training them till my 3rd or 4th month. trained one or two, then trained something else. repeat ad nausem, i actually finished the learning tree about 9 months ago. 5/5 across the board... another 2 and a half years till i see that training pay off"
"no. just no. learning skills are fine as they are, we don't need to see them get more complex just to punish alts(since it's not like this helps anybody)."
"mmmmm...no. personally, i wouldn't mind seeing learning skills go the way of the dodo but creating an entire new system of restrictions just for them is...dumb."
"no"
"i would like biomass (you know, the stuff thats left after a pod-kill!) to be actually made useful, perhaps for a booster ingredient or clone type. this would encourage pod-killing and the trading of biomass, so all-in-all make pvp a little more popular and profitable.of course, it affects the idustralists and marketeers amoungst us, as all those extra ships and equipment need to be supplied by someone...take care,arithron"
"but if it were useful, then one could make a brand new alt and then pod them over, and over, and over to harvest said biomass.unless we're talking different grades of the stuff; ie, pending on their total sp. then it would be kind of neat, but very very difficult to justify.any particular ideas in specific?"

"backgroundthe stated goal of factional warfare, according to ccp greyscale's first devblog on the subject was as follows:\"factional warfare provides a halfway house for players from empire to get into the sandbox at the shallow end. it serves other functions too, for other types of player, but this is its primary function.\"so, the target audience is the empire huggers, both those in npc corps and those in empire based, carebearish player corps. so, basically at players like myself, who enjoy pvp in many other games/forms, but have been reluctant to get thier feet wet in the stark reality of pvp in new eden.the problemthis is similar to the alliance issue, although is quite seperate. those empire players in npc corps don't have too much of an issue here. they are simply free to join/leave one of the new npc corp militias at will.the empire players in player corps however, have very stark choices to make if players in them want to participate. they either:sign up the entire corp, which means that those players in the corp that don't want to participate have thier high sec access curtailed, along with dealing with other wartime dangers, or have to leave the corp.leave thier (possibly) long time player corps, thier roles/responsibilities in those corps, ect, to join an npc militia corp, in order to participatemake an alt (if a slot is available), and suspend training on your main, in order to train an alt for fwthe first choice is silly. while it may work for empire based pvp corps, for most empire carebear corps the choice is simple. no. its simply not fair to subject those friends who don't want to participate to the consequences of fw. since by greyscale's account, it is these carebears they are targeting with this expansion, this just doesn't make much sense to join a carebear corp in with a fw npc alliance.the second choice is a sad one to make as well. for an mmo that is heavily based on player interaction, encouraging players to leave player corps/alliances in any way, is just bad policy. while leaving to try fw for a few days now and then might work for some players, for others with roles and responsibilities in thier current player corp, that option just isn't realistic. not to mention the annoying constant shuffle of roles leaving and joining will cause ceos and directors.the third option: any design that encourages the use of alts, over main characters, is a bad one in my opinion. while this is somewhat consistant with many of eve design decisions that have resulted in rampant alt use for research, trade, hauling, mission running, and heck, forum posting, i still feel that it is not something to be encouraged or expected in order for your target audience to participate.basicaly, you shouldn't have to jump through that many hoops just to participate in something that is supposedly targeted at your playstyle.possible solutionwhile i don't have all the answers, it seems to me that removing fw from the corp/alliance mechanics seems to be the best way to do this. add a new character stat, faction, which defaults to neutral, but you can sign up for any faction available if you meet thier entry requirements.while i can see the pros and cons of excluding players in alliances, if ccp is adamant about that fact, then it should be simple to exclude them using this method. just make it a requirement for joining a faction. so if you are in an alliance, you are denied entry. or if your corp joins an alliance, then all corp members are kicked from thier factions automatically.in conclusioni really see this issue as seperate from the alliance issue. if fw truly is aimed at empire carebears, the current implementation is highly flawed. while npc corp carebears are covered, it places too many barriers in front of player corp carebears who want to try this out."
"i believe that as long as your corp doesn't sign up for one of the militias anyone in that corp or allience is alowed to fight for the empire that they desire without leaving their corp or allience."
"you have 2 ways of taking part in fw:1. as an individual in a npc militia corp.2. as a whole corp.this excludes:1. corps in alliances2. alliances as a whole3. individuals in corps, you would have to leave the corp."

"i get a kick out of this i am going to assume that with your defence on this you are a ninja salvager. so let me put it in my view or ya once, i have flipped cans on a regular basis, i do this for 2 reasons, 1 reason free ore, 2nd, once in awhile you get a chance for some pvp in empire, but mostly its for the ore. when i do this i know i put my ship at risk, and believe me i have lost a few, but my point on the subject is this, if you are out can mining, and i warp in to a nice juicy can of ore sitting there and i fly over and slip it, you and your corporation now have the option to pop me whether you do or not is another story but teh \"option\" is there, now if the miner or miners corp does not engage i cannot fight them or w/e, so they then made the choice not to defend their can, i think mission runners should have same option with their salvage wrecks.and before someone goes on about it i can flip in a frigate sometimes a cruiser, but nothing t2, and overpowering, and we got guys in our home system which is .9 mining with bs gaurds now to defend their cans. that makes it that much more fun, ninja salvaging is just lame not sure how it is fun with no risk but to each his own i guessi'll tell ninja salvagers like i tell can flippers, don't build a 20-30mil ship to steal in cuz you just might die in it. that is one thing i love about eve is every risk you take, has a potential reward, but also a potential risk to your character, except ninja salvaging"

"not another of these anti-learning skill threads look, it's simple.....you don't have to do them.if you don't like them, go skill something else. there's nothing making you do them. whether you do or not i don't care, just stop with the chorus of whining noobs starting a thread a day on this topic."

"while the dpv is seems high for the phoenix the time between volleys is much longer. launchers fire at every 22 seconds versus say beams which are around 7 seconds. if beams hit for 10k per turret that is 30k per volley, you get almost 4 volleys in the time it takes a launcher to fire another volley.right now i believe all dreads except the minmatar have 3 gun slots and and a high slot for siege. the minmatar has 4 gun slots (2 launcher + 2 turret) plus a slot for siege module.the dreads are pretty balanced, why the minmatar dread gets an extra turret i dunno."

"i won't be available as an alt due to the timing of the meeting. have fun."
"could you give an example of such ones?"
"i'd like to raise an objection to agenda item 1, for the following reasons:each player is only allowed to present one issue- here, 60+ issues are being presented together. i see no mention of a csm member being exempt from this one topic limit. they can support as many issues as they like. however, each issue on the pdf and start of this thread needs to be proposed on the thread by a different player, discussed for 7 days etc.each of these are seperate issues and have different implications, level of support and the like. there needs to be seperate discussion on each one. i doubt that you will have time in a meeting to discuss each of the 60+ issues raised in the pdf. take care,arithron"
"originally by: viktor amand--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i, personally, wish the representatives wouldn't give their own ideas (some of which lack popular support) priority over those which clearly have popular support with many more support posts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------could you give an example of such ones? (la vista)i can easily give an example:"
"to give a proper example you would have to also include an issue with more popular support being ignored in favour of this.as an aside it is also the csm members rights to bring up issues which they feel are important to eves future. that's why they were voted in. if you wanted a puppet council you should have voted for someone else."
"this really. i've actually been pretty wide-ranging in the issues i've nominated to the agenda thus far and looked for the highest levels of relative support as a tie-breaker. its important we get the material for good meaty discussions at the iceland summit and that means getting a move on in the selection of issues. some candidates did stand on purely administrative platforms without opinions of their own, but by and large the eve electorate voted for people with outspoken views and the drive to get things done."

"not true - many players have started multiple threads on assembly hall. for example, i've started 4, of which 2 are being discussed this week. as well, many people are bringing up multiple topics in one thread - usually in the form of comprehensive fixes on one topic of discussion, exactly like lavista. i don't recall seeing this as being disallowed anywhere in the csm rules. unless i missed something(and if i did, let me know), everything happening here is perfectly in order.also, jade, your agenda has an error - the link to issue #11 is wrong. please update it, so that we can be sure which issue you're referring to."
"thank you herschel, fixed it now."
"if all the issues were brought up individually, you won't get the large picture either. and without the large picture, it won't benefit the entire eve society. the industry side of eve is extremely complex. some of the things in my issue relies on other issues. some can be implemented alone(bug fixes, general ui improvements and gameplay mechanics). but some of the ideas does have large implications indeed.that is why this is just a list of things for ccp to have a look at. ginger stated at the devchat recently, that industrial love will happen in the next expansion(post-fw), and this is why the market discussion forum, who put this together, wants to gather together a large bunch of things, such that ccp can work on it. the csm term is planned around the fact that expansions go out every <U+FFFD> year. so csm is exactly the right place to bring up a huge bunch of issues and ideas for ccp to work on.by your logic that one can't raise an issue with several aspects is not good. many of the isuses that are brought up so far have extremely many aspects, which will have to be discussed. the only difference from that and then the issue i raised, is that i made it pretty clear what the exact issues are."
"sorry, quite correct!i mant to say that each player is allowed to start one topic per thread..obviously lavista isn't doing this, since 60+ topics in one thread...arithron"
"the point i am trying to make lavista is that you do bring up many issues that need discussed- but each needs a seperate thread to discuss them in turn. at a meeting of the csm, you will need to debate each issue in turn and vote on each one- not vote once on 60+ issues!some affect the whole eve society, some don't...take care,arithron"
"wouldn't creating +60 issues create an extreme overhead, especially when they can't really be discussed and individual issues per say, due to the clear connection between most of the issues?"
"well, they already creat the overhead by virtue of there being so many of them! they are connected simply by falling under the 'science and industry' category. each is a seperate issue by itself...and hence needs a seperate thread for discussion and debate for 7 days by players. and then, of course, each issue needs to be discussed and then voted upon by the csm. the csm document makes this clear.take care,arithron"
"no, that isn't really the case. it's way more complex than you make it out to be. some of them relies on other things, it's that simple."
"they may rely on other things, but you can bring those up when you are discussing and debating the issue in a csm meeting, or on the thread for a specific issue. afterall, thats what you have been elected to do as a group...take care,arithron"
"what about a thread voting system? everybody could just open the thread, and click a \"yes\" or \"no\" to vote for the subject without having to actually post. it could also be \"forbidden\" to post in the thread without having something constructive to add to it. this would limit the amount of \"/signed\" posts and allow everybody to see the actual votes of yes/no.i haven't even made it into the other section so i don't know if this is implemented or not."
"its entirely reasonable. and they don't have to change anything they can just make the threads in the jita park forum instead of the assembly hall forum.jade constantine however, has rejected this idea out of hand instead of doing the sensible thing and having discussions on topics."
"hmm, are you saying that in the last election, each alt could also cast a vote? if so, this seems to me pretty outrageous and the vote tallies of the candidates need to be adjusted to take account of this- as some will have only a third as many votes etc! take care,arithron"
"please can someone point me to the minutes from the first two meetings?they are not where i expected them to be.thanks-cj"
"the abaddon is awesome, fit a cap booster and train support skills"
"i am glad i got a discussion going =) thanks for the responses. honestly i love the abaddon but the cap gets killed off real fast it was just a few suggestions to maybe make it a bit more cap friendly. i have my energy skills up to lvl's 4 and 5 and it does help keep the light show going for a while but it does drain so much faster than the apoc. with the added launcher and one less turret it would still rain down death and destruction albeit with a bit more of a damage ranges other than em and thermal.. and it wouldn't nessiceraly be a nerf keep the laser damage and resist bonus because that ship can tank second to none. but it does suck when you have to warp out of a lvl 4 to just go and recharge and come back to it granted the abaddon isn't the fastest bs in the game but it sure is one of the sexiest...."
"if everybody going \"hell no, abaddon is fine\" is considered a discussion to you, then good for you. in any case, the abaddon is a fine ship, try fitting a cap booster."

"ra extensively use shield tanks for their nags, so you're quite wrong.one of the naglfar's main problems is that there's quite a large difference between certain dreads, and they're at the bottom.for example, let's compare the top and the bottom:revelation2,149,645 ehp5477 dps sustained tank (lasts ~6 minutes while firing)6317 dps outgoing (6580 with sentries)very much cap stable while firing (+112/-77)fits with almost 30% cpu and pg free.1700m2 sigradnaglfar2,091,306 ehp1348 dps sustained tank (10577 burst - lasts ~2mins)4020 dps outgoing (4283 with sentries)requires all faction lows to fit plus a 1-3% cpu implant.1850m2 sigradnote that this is with similar care to fittings: both have faction lows though only the naglfar requires it, both use faction ammo (though only 2 of the naglfar's guns can use faction ammo - there are no faction torps). both are done using an all-5 character.but i guess it's okay because the naglfar can align a full 2.7 seconds faster wootah minmatar agility (30.4s/27.7s)"
"everything minmatar, from battleships, upward need a boost, but this definitely gets a please visit your user settings to re-enable images..the split weapon system on the naglfar is a sick joke, and a poorly-thought design."
"chiming in for my support here. i trained right up to dreads - then realized the naglfar was basically a complete waste of my time. killing a highslot and converting it to pure projectile would be a good start, although as yorda has pointed out that's still not putting it in the same realm as the revelation is.i'll probably end up crosstraining to amarr caps, which is a pity since i really like the unique look of the nag."
"yes"
"i've never had a problem with mini being the jack of trades master of none race, armour or shield tank, turrets or missiles, in fact i like it, but what i hate is that most of the ships have undefined roles in terms of there tank.i mentioned this in another post in ships and mods forum, make the ships more specific, give a slot layout that suggests a shield or armour tank, don't give it 5 mids, 6 lows and higher shield hp's in the case of the tempest, give the extra mid for low and let it be a shield tanker or vice versa, or whatever, let them do both but tie down the ships to a specific tank is all, or if you do want to make it optional for a ship to choose, balance the slots and hp's.as for the naglfar, its a joke. somebody really f*cked up there, longest training time for a dread, laughable tank, and lets be honest, didn't the fact you had to add another weapon slot not alert you to the fact there might just be a problem with the ship??also the ragnarok, sig radius bonus!!!!!! when you guys do f*ck it up, you do properly.whilst some of the criticism may seem a bit on the harsh side, i would argue the point that obvious and stupid mistakes should always be highlighted and the perpetrators constantly reminded that in some cases they'd come a poor second to a house brick in an iq test."
"what setups where you using? i plugged in the standard goon fitting for the nag and it had 1-1.3mil ehp. also i think my revelation setup is out of date."
"confirming this. i was an all-minmatar pilot until i reached the bs level (which also needs work) and saw how crap their cap ships were. i then switched over, did months more of training so i could fly the gallente cap ships instead.boost minmatar cap ships and bs's!"

"sounds like a good idea to me, and hopefully very simple to implement. supported!"
"this sounds simple to code in; a small import/export button. export will export the current overview settings into a small file [heck, even making it a text dump wouldn't be so difficult.]. then you could import that file.not only useful for people using multiple accounts and computers, but for corporations and alliances that want to offer efficient overviews for certain operations, or for inventive pilots to make their own settings and post on the forumsdoubleplusgood."
"not a problem i face, but i can see why that would be insanely aggravating. if the game isn't going to preserve your ui settings (), you should be able to for yourself."
"yesalso, stop breaking my settings with every patch so i wouldn't need to back them up in the first place."
"yep i like it, and i'd also love the ability to customize overview settings at the alliance/corp level so that everyone in the alliance/corp has the option to \"load alliance/corp default\" from the overview settings tab rather than having to individually customize."
"actually i think a simple standalone app could do this if anyone has a bit of programming knowleged. if i recall correctly, all those settings are kept in config files somewhere in the application data. that said, adding it as an ingame feature wouldn't hurt."
"an 'official' feature to do this rather than manual backups would be great, as well as saving time having to reload the backup after every major patch which insists on changing the settings location to some other random location which is less convenient that the previous one."

"i would agree with op if it was only about acquiring assets (e.g. research points), and research was something the player participated in...as it is, it is an npc driven function, and therefore has no bearing on whether the character is active or not...so, not supporting this idea"
"why is gaining sp with an inactive account such a problem?the training to battleship v is useless without the isk to support the next purchases. if you have the isk, one presumes you're contributing to the game in some way (paying for someone else's gametime, or having a fleet of mining alts, etc)."
"some people go away for military or work meansso they decide not to pay but set a long skill training,although it may be hurting ccp's bottom line, they are likely to lose more people if they stop rp/sp gains. why? cause coming back to after being away and having a few more sp is good for player moral"
"turning on eve online and opening your character sheet to click once over it is not playing the game. also very few people have the godly patience to be waiting 4-6 weeks for a single level of some skill to finish. people play mmos game with achievement being primary fun factor. if you force people to train all the long skills while they are subscribed and playing they will have to go long time without achieving anything skill-wise and this will subtract from the fun of the game."
"i disagree1) expired account rp = cheap datacore = cheap t2 stuff = more players can afford to use good equipments2) expire sp benefits a lot of ppl, and does not affect others"
"congratulations on torpedoing your own argument in your final paragraph well, i *suppose* a mid-way solution would be acceptable : instead of leaving it like it is, instead of making it how you suggested, you could have both sp/rp gains halved while not active.this leaves in the incentive to return, but puts the inactive \"farmers\" at a distinct disadvantage.still don't like the idea all that much... though i agree it's mildly unfair."
"well you know me, i'm not afraid to face the fact that i might be wrong. even if i'm the one who shoots my own idea down. of course equally, you know i don't care if an idea is unpopular either (and it was obvious this one would be).still, thought it worth bringing up even if it goes down in flames. what i'm most pleased about is the general good nature responses. people thought about the matter, respond yea or nay with good reasons either direction, and there was little trolling or flaming around./me shrugs.that's enough of a win for me. especially for me."
"when ccp introduced the research agents, we had to talk to each agent every day or we'd get no points until we did so. very annoying that was. after they nerfed research points to give crap (datacores) instead of t2 bpo's, i guess they felt that removing that annoyance and letting us get some rp's without having to micromanage that crap was justified, considering the rewards.i agree. all things considered, daily income from 4 high-standing agents is like, a couple hours mining veldspar."

"to clarify, i fully agree that the current ui has more than a few issues and would benefit by a fully-realised intelligent redesign. at the moment though - and whilst we (csm / everyone) are pushing for that - these are a few 'quick hits' that there should be little difficulty in fixing (speaking there with my 'writing code for over 35 years' hat on).active window is already used for fleet self-invites, sfaiaa, so shouldn't be too difficult to add either, though i'll take what i can get in the short term.iz"

"the only way i could ever support this would be, if:a) the best ideas and improvements get regularly moved back into the standard interface (even then, many will keep their changes private).b) a system is in place to quickly switch between specialized interfaces, so a focused interface modification doesn't result in less flexibility (it's just terrible when players have to choose between an interface that allows them to do one thing well, or an interface that allows them to everything a bit less well).generally i am against excessive customization, because it detracts from the real problem (the interface needs to be improved) and adds unnecessary complexity, which can actually make it harder to implement real improvements (and it definitely makes it harder to get into the game, not just because you might have to at least download a more efficient interface, but also because not everyone may be on the same page regarding ui documentation)."
"by \"play more\" i mean \"spend more of their time actually playing\", as opposed to fighting with the ui. and it's not that i want to make a \"christmas tree\" out of my ui - wow pastels aren't really my thing - it's that i want to be able to do something with it to make it not like beating my head against the wall. i'm not a fan of wow gameplay, and i love eve's, but on the ui front my opinions are completely the opposite. eve's ui is an abomination in so many ways, whereas wow has done just about everything right that i can see. tbh i'd say you're nuts. i can't comment on gw(unlike wow, it hasn't eaten the life of half of my friends), but this insinuation that people only want scripting so that they can cheat is insanity. i don't cheat, i've never cheated in any multiplayer game i've played, and i don't intend to start no matter what scripting is added to eve. and while none of us can be sure, i imagine myself to be pretty typical. most people are here to play, not to rack up bigger numbers, and even if most of the worst fears about scripting were realized, a large majority of players wouldn't abuse the new system. also, the \"go back to wow\" bit is provincialism at its worst. i don't like the game, but it didn't get to 10 million subscribers because the devs were stupid and implemented a game with no redeeming features. i've never heard of a game company doing badly by picking up best practices from blizzard, and wow's ui is definitely one of the best things blizzard has produced that i've ever seen. don't ignore them just because of the deep inferiority complex everybody on these forums seems to have with regards to our local 800-lb gorilla."

"i would like to throw my 2 cents in about bacon. as far as i'm concerned, this program is only an enhancement to the existing interface. to those that claim this program detracts from eve, think about this- don't you think that in the future that on-board ships computers would at least be able to make audible sounds? imo this is only a natural progression and this sort of program should be encouraged rather than stomped on just because a few people take issues with it. the program isn't foolproof but it's somewhat effective. since this tool is now available to everyone, everyone has an equal chance to take advantage of it so to those who say it's not fair i say quit your whining and use the program too then. this program clearly does not violate the eula and is one of the more innovative programs i've seen for eve. since it doesn't use macros, i believe this program should be allowed to operate with eve."
"local doesn't work correctly anyways. if a cloaker enters a system and immediately cloaks, it should follow that he is cloaked and therefore should not be visible in system or local until such a time that he decloaks or decides to break tactical silence in that channel.i don't use bacon, i haven't tried it yet, but my understanding is all that it does is basically read the logfile for you in realtime. so it's a helpful 3rd party app. it's not macromining, macroratting or cheating in anyway that i can see. i say fix local first and then fix the rest of the buggy ass ui before we go picking on small apps. it would go to reason that if bacon gets the axe for being a 3rd party app, then maybe eft, evemon and the plethora of other tools should too. maybe the api should not be availiable to players. maybe the game shouldn't have the ability to be alt-tabbed down like many other mmo's have been in the past. make it an exclusive client to the foreground of the computer it's running on and disable alt-tab./not signed"

"boosting the pain of sentry guns would be a nice start towards decreasing the imbalanced higher risk of low sec, thus encouraging people to go there imo."
"i disagree, they hit pretty hard and thats in a t2 fitted bs."
"afaik, sentries do 176 dps per gun, so in low-sec with two guns per gate, 352 dps. damage type spread is quite ok (17% em, 17% ex, 33% ki, 33% th, iirc). they have a 100% hit chance and an optimal of 150km or so, which makes their dps a good deal higher than the comparable dps of a bc/bs. i'd say they're at non-gank bs level, comparatively, which is ok. you need a dedicated tank on your bs to actually permanently tank them - or you spider tank. but they're not meant to pwn your bs when you get flagged, they're meant as a nuisance and anti-tackler weapon.the biggest problem that makes sentries easily tankable is that they do not combine fire and cycle targets. if you have a few people in your fleet, you only have to survive 176 dps for 20 seconds. that's ridiculously low, and a spider tank can easily keep everyone alive. that is the problem with sentries.do not give unnecessary, additional bonuses to large groups. make sentries shoot every flashy at a gate at the same time. then, their current dps is just fine, and they work as a nice force mitigator."

"it's not a isk sink, its a faucet. drake platinum insurance costs 12m, and pays out 38m. injecting 16m isk out of no where.this will only lower the amount of ganks able to be done over time but not change the low risk/high reward. just use a few alts and again you can do it 72 times a day with 2 alts with a 1 hour global countdown.tank gates? in lowsec? not relevant at all to high sec ganking.low sec ganking is a completely different subject really.and how is letting pirates shoot people and be free to warp to another gate/station without getting shot at by those sentry guns going to attract the carebears more? i think thats what you mean i hope. if they didn't shoot at all it wouldn't be good. all this would attract is more pirating."
"to hammer home my earlier point, asking for a change in the game is all well and good if the problem cant be solved because the game is broken, in this case it isn't.lets be honest here, its about greed, people don't want to interrupt their isk flow taking a little bit of time to counter the problem.all together now...the solution is simple....the solution is simple....the solution is simple....repeat to fade."
"i agree with the op's concept of not providing insurance to criminals when they engage in criminal activity. so, basically, if you perform an action which flags you as a criminal, and your action directly or indirectly results in the loss of another person's ship, and you lose your ship within the agression timer, your insurance payment becomes null and void."
"voiding the insurance wont solve the problem, believe me, it wouldn't stop me, what does stop me tho is my targets showing a little bit of savvy and realizing how easy it is to counter a gank."
"it solves the win-win situation that currently exists, which i think is what this is really about. i don't think anybody is in favor of removing the ability of the suicide gankers, as they play an important role in the game"
"not signed. you seem to be missing the bigger picture and are focused on your paticular playstyle, pimped mission running.a few points:1) it already takes 6+ battleships to take down a raven. if we void insurance that will cost 400m-600m making a break even gank target 800-1200m in modules with a large risk of a massive isk loss. if you fly your mission ship in a 0.7 or 0.8 with a dc ii you are looking at probably 1.8b isk just to break even. when you factor in the time costs of waiting, raising security, organising the gang, selling the loot and fitting the ships up then you will want a target of at least 3b. so is that the point at which you should become a target to suicide gankers? seems awfully high to me.2) you are ignoring how this change will effect the suiciding of haulers and miners. the question is, is there a problem at the moment, do we need to make ganking more difficult because it is unbalancing the economy? are price differentials between different regions huge because of the extreme risk of hauling goods. are traders and haulers claiming they can't make a profit because their goods get vaporised the second they undock? are meta loot prices skyrocketing because it can't be safely brought to market? is the isk faucet of high sec ganking and the wholescale destruction of loot causing hyperinflation? no, at the moment smart haulers are making money, those who aren't aware of the risks or aren't competent to deal with them are losing money. this is good, no?3) you want to void insurance for successfull ganks, which encourages a scatter gun approach to ganking and rewards sloppy gankers.4) you completely ignore the major cost of ganking which is the security status hit. even with good 0.0 access a freighter hit takes upwards of 7 man hours of ratting to raise, a battleship hit 4 and a hauler hit 0.5-1 hour. these are not insignificant time costs and whilst you do earn isk when doing it you earn a lot less when you are concentrating on raising sec status.5) insurance system is broken because the market is flooded with cheap minerals. this is a problem for all eve not just ganking. how do you break a corporation that can just undock one 'throwaway' bs after another. how do you clear out low sec pirates who camp in cheap fit bs. so why is the market flooded with cheap minerals and arby siege launchers. maybe we need less people running missions and high sec mining and more people getting cheap ships blown up to drive up the prices of minerals.6) ganking is a self balancing system. there are no npc haulers who ram tech i haulers full of nice loot and then afk to their destination. there are only so many mission runners with pimped ships to kill and only so many x-type boosters to be destroyed. whining that some gankers can make billions of isk is like whining that traders can do likewise. it is pvp and if it is extremely profitable get your slice of the pie until it is not so profitable anymore (either from competition from other gankers or victims wising up, this has noticably happened with cnrs in the last few months imo). if you do will probably find that good gankers work hard and show teamwork to make a decent hourly return."
"supported"
"i support this proposal."
"i support the op where he said insurance doesn't get paid if the ship being targeted gets blown up first."
"are you a miner dray?"
"a. if you are taking it upon yourself to do ccp's job, then you take the risk upon yourself.b. i've never actually killed a mission buddy by firing on them...been ganked by concord, for sure, but never killed a mission buddy that i accidently fired upon...which is why you only make it so that if you participate in a kill for someone and then die by concord, either before or after the kill happens, then you lose your insurance payout. stops the accidents from killing your wallet.c. seems to be a lot of suicide ganking of freighters and industrial ships when i fly through space."
"it is obvious those farming in concord protected areas hope for peace and quiet to go about their merry business. it doesn't matter if you think it is wrong or right - it is how it is; it is part of what makes eve, eve.the problem with things such as \"no insurance payout\" is that they are one sided solutions. they cater to the miners, and nobody else. it doesn't address why a miner should have this special protection for the sake of their fun or profit, but a pirate or suicide ganker does not.suicide ganking does cost people something. the fact that they might come out on top of the loss - maybe even by a hefty margin, does not change the fact their was a loss. you invested in your cargo holds, your mining lasers, mining drones, your hauler, whatever. they invested in a ship capable of ganking a target in less than 30s. those are your investments, and you are suggesting that only the mining investments should not have any risk. what you are suggesting is that people should be so afraid to gank a perfectly legitimate (and juicy) target so that you lose nothing and they lose everything.you'll argue \"no no, they can still gank us, but it is going to hurt them a lot more!\" but that isn't what you're saying: you want no insurance payout on successful suicide ganks; you may want concord to respond even faster to prevent the gank in the first place. you want this so that suicide ganking becomes unattractive to anybody. afterall, who is really going to suicide gank as a business initiative if it only results in a net loss? and you like that idea - mine in peace. you get to make money for nothing but time. no risk. wannabe pirates...100% risk, to the point that they aren't even allowed to pirate for profit, but only for \"****s and giggles.\"and this seems fair to you? there are only two answers: yes or no. if yes, then you boldly admit that your idea of fun - the idea that is not supported by eve itself, is somehow the golden rule. if no, then there is nothing to actually discuss, because if you say no but want to entertain unfair ideas, then you really meant to say yes, now didn't you?you engage in mining, which you know could cause you to lose your ship and cargo to a pirate. so i guess you will be ok with not getting any insurance out of it, either?if you want to discuss whether or not something needs a nerf, you need to look out how widespread the phenomena is, and how it is actually affecting the game. do you believe that the majority of haulers are ganked? do you believe even 30% of them are ganked? 10%? how many suicide ganks a day would you estimate occur? how many ganks fail? how many total hauls occur without being killed? what sort of net loss on the economy of eve do you think there is? (please note, this is for eve, not for you...what you lose and what is not destroyed is still on the market or in use, and therefore is not a loss for eve, only for you). if there is a net loss, is there a noticeable impact to the economic system - negative or positive, and if so, what are those impacts?you can't simply say \"i feel this is wrong\" just because you don't find it fun. somebody is always going to find no-fun in what somebody else does. if you feel there is truly a gamebreaking issue, then treat it as such instead of saying \"i feel.\""
"i think this sums up most of the posts for change in this forum. there is very little supportive numbers on anything. no one has ever stated how wide spread this is and how often it actually occurs. majority of all posts and or responses is based of an emotional protest rather than logging out of their respective character and really look at it logically rather than emotionally. unfortunately i see this in some sense on the csm board and that concerns me as to the true objectivity of the decisions being made or if some one takes up the cause to write up a proposal to ccp, how much of that csm's bias is injected into that proposal. and how much of the responding player base is ignored because they do not feel it is right. ank has taken this on to present to ccp, and we all know her stance on the issue and how much she wants to wipe out this kind of play. she has stated it in her video. so will ccp also see the objections from the player base that do not want to see the change in an issue like this or will it ignored because it does not support the current proposal to make the change?there has been and always will be player groups that want nothing to do with pvp or anything of the like. and that same player base will do what they can to change the landscape of eve to mirror other mmo's that have no fight zones stating that if ccp wants more of the market share this has to happen. well hate to break it to all you players that think this way but suicide ganking has been going on a very, very long time and with much more veracity than what you see now. and ragequit post after ragequit post was thrown in c&p and yet, the sub base grew. now why do you think that happened."
"well the csm members have not exactly tried to hide that they are just in it for their personal agendas. but so far they dont seem to be more than a glorified suggestion forum so does it really matter? time will tell if this has any merit but cant say it looks promising atm.hopefully those that really matter (the devs) can make their decisions from a more objective view of the game."
"i would support this, but i would also like to be able to assign hotkeys to each of my groups so i can setup things like squada(ctrl-1 to launch, alt-1 to return) squadb(ctrl-tilde, alt-tilde)"
"agreed, though i'd also suggest that we allow for overlapping groups as well - i fly a kronos, among other ships, and the 125 bay/75 bandwidth means i use 2 heavy, 5 medium, and 5 light drones. sometimes i want max dps(2 heavy, 2 med, 1 light), sometimes i want just a boring flight of 5 mediums or 5 lights. right now, i have to set up my groups for one or the other, and switching is a pain. the ability to mix and match more easily would be very convenient, for basically any ship that has 30-45 or 55-120 bandwidth. nope. whole voting system needs an overhaul, but there's a few threads up on that already."
"i approve this"

"unplayable lag. should the developers be adding to this game when large fleet battles and small encounters get a heavy amount of lag? ( winners dont lag & losers seem to always lag) shouldnt resolving lag issues be priority? what does it mean when a gm said without solid verification in each individual case when it is clear that in every major conflict lag occurs. how do you prove lag? the reimbursement plan needs better understanding of the players. good games drop players when they lag and redo it when you relog. bad games act like there is no lag. ive been with this game almost 4 years, each year on a new pc. i am qualified to determine that lag occurs. its becoming harder and harder to support a game which doesnt face or addresses the issues except with hollow works as without solid verification in each individual case\". what is ccp doing to address these issues? it seems they have convinced themselves that lag do to connection points doesnt happen"
"you want to know how to cure lag in eve? donate about $10 million to ccp for them to upgrade their servers. it's not that they don't want to, it's that the hamsters needed to make 1000-man fleet fights and 2000-man trade hubs work - and don't kid yourself, they'd get that big if it was possible - are way too expensive for ccp to buy as it stands. they're working around the edges as best they can - you may notice a few billion fewer cans were anchored around high-sec a few months back, for example - but the sheer server-crunching power of blob fights isn't something that can be addressed short of a whole lot of millions ccp doesn't have."
"the biggest fight i've ever been in was 30 vs 30, and i didn't notice any lag that was ccp's fault in it.as far as i know, only systems with hundreds of people in them cause lag. and gigantic0rz battles between large numbers of pilots, and carriers.ps - why didn't my spellcheck catch 'gigantic0rz' but is telling me that spellcheck should be two words? o.o"
"lol ccp had the nerve to tell me on a petition about the lag the couldnt reimburse ships due to the lag could have been caused by a large fleet battle.hmm something seems wrong with this picture,if you cant stop lag due to large fleet battles then why not limit the size of fleet battles to something they can control lag in until as what time they can hope to have a playable game.also why not stop all the crazyness like factional warefare and such until as what time you can make a playable game as you have it currently,otherwise give us what the h*** we pay for ccpalso there were approx. 400k accounts that could vote on the csm election lets suppose that just half those were paying accounts so 200k x 15.00 per month is 3 mil dollars per month or 36 mil a year do you really think they cant afford decent servers if they wanted to buy them roflcome on ccp you stated in your post about the 60 day time cards a fact that raises the rates to play almost 35% that you wanted to stay with industry standards. industry standards is not a server so laggy that end game content cant even be played as designed,and its not customer service that ansers petitions just whenever they feel like it every mmo game i have played,and i have played since ultima answers petitions in a matter of hours bu game contact you dont have to chase the answers in a my account on a website....in short you wanna keep up with the \"jones\" you have to act like the \"jones\""
"atm, ccp is working together with ibm, microsoft and some other corporation.to build a super-computer. this will spread 1 system between different servers to get better performance.it is however hard to build, but it's gonna be in the top 5 best super computers in europe and top 50 in the world (if i'm correct).they are working on it, but this can't be done over night..."
"still if us can uses write this as a reply to a client, without solid verification in each individual case there has to be a system to verify or document lag. or your calling your customer indirectly a liar. and by all industrial standards that is not acceptable. this lag is clear at the server if 64 plus people all agree that the lag was unplayable."
"who cares about the server, the issue here is customer service for know problems and how ccp gm handle the problem. if the server is the problem, than all lag issues should be reimbursed. but ccp gm are taking the position that there is no lag and not given a client(s) a system to document the lag. if they are going to denied us base on there reply listed above. they are calling their customers liars and don't provide a way document the problem as it occurs. so that comes back to the customer is lying. that is not acceptable by all industrial standards (dont replay if youre a alt)."
"true the real issue her is customer support something ccp knows nothing about.its kinda ironic to tell me the lag may have been because of a large fleet battle,something eve is all about but the major fail is they wont admit that it can in any way be thier fault.i find it hard to think its localised isp problem when 65 people from all over the world have the problem at the same time,the lag is a everyday thing in this game in large capital ship fleet battles i find it hard myself to understand why they even have lag say in jita for instance and yes i know your gonna say well there is 500-1000 people there.well fact is other games have major citys with massive graphics inviolved in rendering the citys details then add ontop of that 500-600 or so people and there is no lag lets face it the graphics in this game really arent that intensive so whats up with all the lag anyways"
"jade, what is the best way to defend a station system? no, but it is your job to rationally examine issues and quash ones that would damage the game.if you think that only large alliances should be able to hold sov and everyone else should be flying in lowsec then i don't know what to say. more people flying and fighting in 0.0 is a good thing.edit:correlary: if its so easy to just hold stations and get them back later why don't you go and enforce neutrality like your rp dictates you should?"
"griefing is the practice of destroying something someone else owns for the purpose of causing them pain and agony with no regard to personal benefit. you do it cause you feel good making the other guy suffer and not because it in anyway helps you. lots of isk was lost on jihadswarm for nothing more than laughs. some people made isk because of insurance but many did not. also insurance is an entirely seperate issue."
"are you saying that we are going to not destroy stations we have no intention or way of holding, or selling?we are just going to sit there with empty useless stations waiting to be taken?"
"hi goum. i am trying to resist trolling here but we are clearly not capable of seeing this massive problem we think we see. soon only bob and the swarm will be in 0.0 and there will be nobody else to shoot. jade is obviously right no matter how many holes we shoot into the argument or ways it would hurt the game and the swarm long term. goons are mostly pvp so we like targets in case anyone can't figure this out. when there is only bob and titan blobs to go fight we are just going to have to jihadswarm more for fun.i don't but as i already said i am very atypical goon."
"i have to admit i only read a small portion of the op.i could support this, but its all down to implementation. i don't think alliances should be able to destroy outposts willy nilly. if this was implemented, destruction of the station should only be possible by the alliance that holds it and has a sovereignty level of 3 in the system. ccp could implement some sort of \"self destruct\" button that becomes available at that sovereignty level. that way the alliance that captures the outpost would need to exert its control over the sovereignty for a good period of time before blowing up the station. it also gives the alliance that just lost the outpost a chance to regroup and perform a counterstrike. it would also allow a defending alliance to blow up existing outposts under their control if they believe they cannot hold on to them.such a situation would create bargaining chips never seen in the game before. a defeated alliance could use the outposts it still controls as a bargaining chip, and the invading alliance could hold the assets in the acquired outposts as hostage.one serious problem with this is that a deep cover spy who has attained a position of privilege could destroy the outpost. say what you will about spying in eve, i don't think a spy or spiteful alliance executor should weild such power. as such, i think the self destruct should take 2 days, during which any ceo in the alliance can veto it. of course a spiteful alliance executor could still boot corps and enact self destruct, so some measures would be needed there as well.honestly though jade, i don't think the outposts are the problem, its the regions that have outposts intermingled with npc stations. i don't know how ccp allowed such a situation to exist, but you get regions like curse, syndicate and venal where the npcs have total sov over the region, and then the other regions where sov only applies in npc station systems. the outposts in regions with no npc stations change hands far more frequently and the system seems to be 'working' there."
"jade, i voted for you in the elections, in large part because i liked your vision of how this game should work - still do, actually. but seriously man, you're being really cavalier here about an issue that can't take it. what gou is saying is perfectly reasonable, and i can think of no reason to discount it. some space does suck, and a lot of alliances would rather burn bad space than have to extend their reach to include it. goon seems high on that list - this isn't exactly a group known for their infinite patience and methodical approach to territorial expansion, after all. i have no doubt that this mechanic will serve as much to clean out 0.0 space as anything else, and that goes double for the space that isn't valuable enough to hold. you're up against a really hard conundrum in implementing this. on one hand, i don't think anybody wants to promote scorched earth tactics - they suck, both for scorcher and scorched. as such, an outpost has to be destroyable by enemy action, not merely by the owner scuttling it. on the other hand, you need to make it so that they're hard as hell to destroy by enemy action, so you don't just lose control for an hour and see your station pop. i think it's possible to finesse the difference there, and create a system that will make station destruction a relevant part of this game without inadvertently making griefing too easy for anybody. but it's not going to happen if you just ignore your opponents, or brush them off as liars looking to advance their own alliance's agenda. don't **** this up."
"and how do you know that? you're not a goon, and i doubt you have any real experience with the goons. instead, you have multiple people here who are worried that the goons will do this, and you even have a few goons saying 'yeah, we'll do this,' and you say it won't happen, yet i've seen nothing in your proposal or responses that would stop them from doing what everyone says they're going to do. time to take the blinders off and look around, jade.you cannot consider an idea in a vacuum, you have to look at how the people, the players, will respond to it. here you have people worried about goonswarm using this idea to negatively impact the game, you have them telling you they're going to do it, and you think that shouldn't matter? that's a bit like paroling a serial killer after he's told you he's going to go out and kill the members of the jury that convicted him just because you don't believe it.no, your job as csm is to listen to the community, which you've just proven you're not doing (unless they agree with you of course). you are not an advocate, you are not a lobbyist, you are a representative. someone with your lexical knowledge should know the difference."

"the whole small alliance will be hurt the most argument is just a canard imho. it makes an implicit assumption that the attacked small alliance/s will take no action other than fight or flight, no evolution of the political situation of that alliance or the large 'griefer' alliance take place.i'd say if the goons did embark on such a crusade they would rapidly consolidate opposition to themselves by encouraging smaller alliances to form counter blocs dedicated to defending or counter attacking them.and i'd argue, that truly destructible stations, including all your stuffs stored there, would mean that large alliances would have to take outpost building, location and defense very seriously indeed. as unlike today where they could abandon vast amounts of materiel ready for when the counter-attack comes they would have to consider that their opponent might instead destroy the station to destroy this materiel.also the self destruct option works on the strategic defence as well as the offence. an alliance like bob could have destroyed stations as they fell back to delve, leaving a logistical nightmare for a following force rather than a ready made home for their continuing attacks.a smaller entity with a more compact group of stations would have less trouble mounting a serious defence of them, and have a better chance of mounting a successful counter attack (or stuff rescue mission with jade's mechanic) due to its compact nature, than a group that has to defend 20+ across 3 regions from simultaneous assaults.would they build stations in the first place? it comes back to the oldest rule in eve, only fly (build) what you can afford to lose. if someone feels that it would be beneficial to build them, then they will get built, probably by/in agreement with coalitions of smaller alliances.it certainly would slow or stop the construction of outposts by tiny alliances operating in splendid isolation. but, i don't see that as a bad thing."
"i think that's down to you to make sure of not any representitive.by politics or military might. if you can't that's just tough. its the nature of the brutal selection pressures that exist in 0.0, and the currently indestructible outposts are a discordant note in the symphony of destruction that 0.0 should be."
"no it isn't because you can conquer them, and who are you to tell us what 0.0 should be anyway0.0 is the emergent endgame, making outposts destructible encourages stasis because of immense power consolidation through superior forcei dislike stasis"
"page 4 textwall.so instead of having small alliances in isolation, you'd rather have everyone in 0.0 be the protectorates of someone like aaa, ra, goons, bob, you know, someone that can stop aaa, ra, goons, or bob from rolling in with 20 dreadnoughts and blowing their outpost to pieces for lols.here's a situation to help you wrap your head around it. i am leading an alliance of 5000 people that controls 4 regions from which i can harvest massive amounts of money. i have, across from me, 10 alliances of 500 people each, who, combined, also control four profitable regions that they harvest massive amounts of money from. i have 10 outposts, each minor alliance has one. all things are equal, except that we have one large group and ten smaller groups.these ten smaller groups are independent of each other, and may have their own internal sets of politics. let's assume they're all neutral towards each other. this already places them at a massive disadvantage against the big guy - they don't share intel and they're not sharing forces. now, i am the big guy. i mark one of these alliances for destruction. assume a 10% turnout rate for both sides, and i have a fleet of 500 to use against their fleet of 50. thus, i can outnumber them three to one and still have enough people (350, or 35 people per outpost) to defend my borders from any counterattack.without destroyable outposts, i have to take over their territory and capture their outpost, then figure out what to do with it. i want to keep the other nine alliances in check, so i have to protect it. this means my space expands, and i have fewer people per region than the combined forces of my enemies now. now i attack the second alliance, with the same numbers. i bring 150 to blob their 50, but now i only have (about) 32 people per outpost, because i need to defend the one i took from the first alliance. i kick out the second alliance, too, and now have 12 outposts.let's assume that once i've taken out four of these minor alliances, the other six band against me. they have 3000 people in their coalition against my 5000. i attack alliance #5, with the same turnout numbers. i have 500, they have 300. i can match them evenly, but then i only have 14 people per outpost watching things and making sure nobody's hitting my pos's while i'm on campaign, or i can just throw everything at them. they lose and are reeling, but i cannot comfortably extend my reach further to take their space; i have too much space to hold already. a stalemate develops.add in destructible outposts. instead of holding onto those four outposts i captured, i will destroy them. suddenly, i don't have to worry so much about that space; i can ignore it and hit the remaining alliances with full force. i can do this quickly with a capital hotdrop when the other alliances are not online in force, thus destroying their ability to resist a push on their pos's - after all, they will have to recover all their assets from the destroyed outpost, if it survives at all, in order to use it against me, and they now have nowhere to put it. meanwhile, the other six alliances have banded against me and destroyed four of my outposts, to keep it even. i still control all my space though, so i can afford to replace them, plus i have 6 other outposts to move the stuff to. i retaliate by blowing up the other outposts belonging to the six-alliance coalition one by one with my superior numbers until the individual member alliances have lost so much that they break up, surrender, flee, or become my pets. in this way i can force the coalition to break up, one member at a time.get it yet?tl;dr version - a single large entity can cause a coalition of smaller entities to break up a lot easier with destructible outposts by hitting the coalition members, who cannot replace such losses as easily as the large alliance, one by one."
"the whole small alliance will be hurt the most argument is just a canard imho. it makes an implicit assumption that the attacked small alliance/s will take no action other than fight or flight, no evolution of the political situation of that alliance or the large 'griefer' alliance take place.smaller alliances will have to ally with exisiting powerhouses or get steam rolled. we want new entities not new pets.i'd say if the goons did embark on such a crusade they would rapidly consolidate opposition to themselves by encouraging smaller alliances to form counter blocs dedicated to defending or counter attacking them.already explained how this doesn't help much. large alliances have more concentrated firepower than groups of smaller alliances.and i'd argue, that truly destructible stations, including all your stuffs stored there, would mean that large alliances would have to take outpost building, location and defense very seriously indeed. goons would sell more regions or torch them on the way out simply to deny them to others. as unlike today where they could abandon vast amounts of materiel ready for when the counter-attack comes they would have to consider that their opponent might instead destroy the station to destroy this materiel.a small alliance would value the outpost much more than a large alliance. they will have less isk and fewer other outposts already. this would only work for fighting amongst the big guys.also the self destruct option works on the strategic defence as well as the offence. an alliance like bob could have destroyed stations as they fell back to delve, leaving a logistical nightmare for a following force rather than a ready made home for their continuing attacks.again only works on the big guys. if a small alliance managed to come in and take out a goon outpost they would get put back into empire by the counterstrike. not lowsec but empire. we might even deck them to continue the attack.a smaller entity with a more compact group of stations would have less trouble mounting a serious defence of them, and have a better chance of mounting a successful counter attack (or stuff rescue mission with jade's mechanic) due to its compact nature, than a group that has to defend 20+ across 3 regions from simultaneous assaults.titan jumping or jump bridge networks make the big guys far more able to respond across space than you seem to realize. it is about 10 minutes to go the equivalent of 50 jumps atm and mostly safe unless someone wants to tank a pos to try and shoot people taking the highway. big alliances have more mobility structures in place.would they build stations in the first place? it comes back to the oldest rule in eve, only fly (build) what you can afford to lose. if someone feels that it would be beneficial to build them, then they will get built, probably by/in agreement with coalitions of smaller alliances.it certainly would slow or stop the construction of outposts by tiny alliances operating in splendid isolation. but, i don't see that as a bad thing.if they didn't build the outposts in the first place then they already have a huge disadvantage. no market for 1 thing. all production is kept to pos. no loot melting and poor ore melting unless they haul massive amounts a long way. denying smaller alliances the ability to reasonably build outposts is a sure way to make the current powerhouses stronger."
"i am me, with my opinions, that's who.if you don't like them fine i don't imagine that i will persuade everyone with my points of view. onto your points:why does making outposts destructible encourage stasis? i can't see the logic here in what you are saying.destruction by definition is the opposite of stasis, continuously redrawing boundaries by conquest and destruction will not be stasis, whatever else it might be. bob thought they had control of 0.0 and were pushing outwards, perhaps with an inherent assumption of core stasis and stability to their empire and then you guys came along and forged an alliance capable of pushing them back into a very tight box.yet thanks to indestructible stations you were not able to inflict the massive amount of damage that you might have been able to had you been able to utterly wipe out all their fixed infrastructure and supply dumps, leaving only those stations needed for your tactical and strategic advance into their holdings.if you had and all the stuff belonging to their pilots had to be moved or face total destruction, imagine how much more pressure that would have put them under. how much more intense the fight for these resources.superior force is transitory, it has to be consistently and constantly renewed in order to maintain or expand itself. there is no real endgame in 0.0 possible because of the constant emergence and renewal of alliances and powerblocs. this is a result of the open nature of the eve universe and consequently the red queen effect.unless you have a perfect closed system then you as well as everyone else who reaches a position of power will face it. with indestructible stations this plays a lesser role than it might, because ccp (or god or whatever) has magically protected assets from the total destruction that a lack of fitness might mandate.don't get me wrong brmble, i am not against outposts remaining the way they are now, i simply think that the game itself would be more fluid and dynamic, with the possibility of total destruction and consequent economic damage being inflicted on the enemy, than it is currently. removing the invulnerability from outposts would expose those who use them to the full effects of natural selection. i think that would be a beautiful thing."
"all this assumes a closed system where the small alliances and corps cannot bring in new allies, mercs etc and larger predatory third parties dont intervene to take advantage of overstretch on behalf of your 5000 man alliance. it's unreasonably simplistic even with the current game mechanics.and jade's proposal is not that 20 dreads could roll in and lol pop the outpost, they'd have to conquer it and hold it for days first against whatever counter-attacking force could be wielded by the initial owners.as for becoming pets etc, larger alliances would have more difficulty holding pets in place when those pets could visit huge amounts of destruction whilst the masters head is turned elsewhere. the big boys would have to be more compact and less flabby or they would present easier tasty targets for treacherous allies and pets.if anything, after an initial consolidation period and weeding out of the currently unfit but space holding alliances, it would result in strong pressures on the existing powers forcing them to continuously be at their best or risk losing out to the newer and hungrier alliances. i don't think it would make a gigantic change to the way things are right now, but it would weed out the weaker faster than today. (and produce more and larger explosions )"
"oh i am well aware of how handy titans can be for rapid movement and all the other handy tricks like jump bridges.and i know that initially these would give a nice head start to alliances like your own. none of these will help one bit if you make enough enemies that you can be attacked from multiple directions at once though as bob found out.torching or selling regions would have one effect, reducing your own holdings and increasing the space for others to move into. as once torched it could be rebuilt.you are of course totally right about the reasons to build an outpost, a new 0.0 territorial power would have the choice to remain distributed and harder to hit, or somewhat centralized and more efficient but also providing a more focused target for enemy aggression.no different than now really other than the higher economic and consequent internal political cost of failure."
"the issue with small alliances would not able to survive argument is null. and goes to the old eve quote \"don't fly what you can't afford to lose\"adapted to\"don't build what you can't afford to lose\"again though, this idea has to be done right. and in my eyes will go though a lot of discussion within ccp.for self-destructing an outpost, if sov 3 is a must, only displays 2 scenario's1) the defender destroys the outpost so the attacker get nothing to show.2) the attackers take the outpost, and wait the 3+ weeks for sov 3 to destroy it.i think we'd see more of scenario 1 play out, than number 2.mainly because, the longer you do own the outpost, after invasion the more likely you are to find renters. or even someone who wants to buy the outpost."
"first point. assuming no outside interference. most outside parties in eve are hyenas, not knights. they will not step between the huge bully and the tiny victim, they will slowly circle the carcass and steal whatever they can from the moldering corpse. you're unlikely to get a lot of small folks that will help someone against one of the major powers - there's too much loss that's almost guaranteed, and gains are fleeting and sometimes nonexistent.it's worth noting that all the outposts in eve today, have taken years to get there. this proposal could easily see entire reaches of 0.0 scorched back to beta-testing in a couple months. something tells me that's not what ccp's vision of 0.0 is - if they wanted outposts to be destroyable, they would have made them that way in the first place, don't you think?as for not building what you can't afford to lose, that limits outposts only to the select few that can afford such big losses. therefore, again, the biggest, baddest alliances will be the only people that will have them. and how will you compensate the smaller groups that put up an outpost that is now suddenly poppable?my last point. this proposal would require a massive redesign and restructuring of the entire 0.0 formula in order to be implemented fairly. there are many other, better, less disruptive issues that i see on this forum that should be discussed first, particularly the dead horse idea for pos's. even though i know this is chairman's pet project, let's work on the minor things before we go trying to tell ccp to rewrite the entire game."
"i am sure that this is the case, but what i am saying is that it applies to both sides of this equation. third parties might intervene to attack the major power simply because it is entangled elsewhere and wont be able to react fast enough (debatable) to prevent them raiding or stealing territory.also the hyena's might well fancy that outpost for themselves and fight to take it from the major.no i don't think that. what i think is the design decision was made to protect the first outposts in such a way as to encourage them to be built, but further to this i don't think that a couple of months would see most or even large chunks of 0.0 scorched. the economic imperative to have outposts would still be as strong even if they were destructible. no, it limits it to those willing to risk such losses. a small but significant difference imho. people still build them today even though there is a risk they can be captured within days of construction. i don't think they would stop building them simply because someone could theoretically capture one and possibly destroy it and hence there is no more need for compensation from this prospect than there is for the current situation.i don't agree, all that would be required for it to be 'fair' would be to affect every stakeholder equally and if all stations became destructible then this requirement is met by the nature of the change."
"outpost destruction via kamikaze attacks only !regular outpost requires three mothership crashes or one titan crash.first tier improvement requires five mothership crashes or one titan plus one mom.second tier improvement requires seven mothership crashes or one titan plus 3 moms, or 2 titans.third tier improvement requires ten moms, 1 titan and 6 moms, 2 titans and 2 moms or 3 titans.there you go"
"i apologise in advance but this is going to be quite a long one:the reasons why destructible outposts should not be implemented in the game (currently)1) they are not really an issue (we have more important things to discuss)firstly, i think there are many many more important issues that we as a csm should be discussing.i do not see the issue of destructible outposts as being one which will dramatically improve the game play experience for the majority of players - indeed i see its potential implementation as something which will damage the game experience for an even larger group. we really should be giving other issues priority!the fact is that contrary to how the op wishes to portray it galactic politics is a fluid and dynamic thing. over the past few months we have seen gigantic galactic wars in all regions of space. outposts are being lost and recaptured left right and centre.a few examples:the great war - bob forced back to one region and now expanding again...the mc collapse in period basisthe goons vs smashkill warthe triumvirate collapsethe -a- assault on catchbruce's adventures in fountainthe drone region warsthese are just a selection of some of the epic happenings that make eve live and breath as a game - that add spice and interest, and capturing and then holding outposts plays a large part in why 0.0 is as dynamic as it is.the op would like to present the case that that there is no 'risk' to building outposts anymore? is he serious? one glance at the rapidly changing galactic map demonstrates the falsity of that arguement.the fact is that outposts still require gigantic investments - not just in isk but also - and probably more importantly - in the game time required to maintain and defend them. this means that 'space holding' alliances cannot simply be pure pvp organisations but also have to 'industrial' wings with the capacity to maintain and all the supporting defensive infrastructure 23/7 - 356 days a year and this in itself creates interesting dynamics within alliances - as the recent triumvirate split and forum drama revealed.as far as i can tell 0.0 politics is amazingly fractured, fluid and dynamic as it stands. will outpost destruction improve the situation or will it - as i believe - in fact lead to a marked reduction in 0.0 diversity and drama?i really do not see why csm should be giving priority to this issue when as far as i can see we are proposing 'fixing' something which aint really broke. there are many more issues we should be focused upon which will make a positive impact on the eve experience for the majority of players!"
"2) it will not enhance the gameas outlined above the op starts with a completely skewed concept of 0.0. working on the assumption that \"there should be a cost to failure and defeat in wars, empires need to fall as well as rise, and in order to keep eve fresh for new players and future generations of alliance-effort we need to ensure that 0.0 doesnt become so secure and dug-in that it disenfranchises all incoming effort and aspiration to overturn existing power structures.\"not only is that statement factually wrong - there is a cost to failure and defeat in wars (as demonstrated by eve 0.0 politics every single day) - but the proposed solution 'destructible outposts' will not solve the op's percieved problem of disenfranchisement but will indeed make it worse.ask yourself - who exactly will benefit from the introduction of 'destructible outposts'? will it be the 'upstarts' seeking to overturn the 'established' order - or will it be the established order itself?as it stands well organised 'upstarts' can (if they put effort into it - which they should) sieze their own pieces of 0.0, either capturing existing outposts or establishing outposts of their own. indeed if they are well organised they even - under the current system - have a chance of defending and holding onto their space in the face of hostile invasion, if they are dedicated enough.under the proposed system 'upstarts' will have no chance of becoming established whatsoever - unless they are already accepting the protection of an existing 0.0 superpower. the fact is that alliances such as goonswarm, red alliance and bob have the capacity to crush and strangle infant 0.0 alliances at birth. why don't they do so? because they then have to worry about the logistics of maintaining and defending new areas (or finding tenants) and in the process stretching their own logistics/industrial capacities (and pilots) beyond breaking point. after all who actually finds refueling poses fun? however, under the 'destructible outpost' scenario what we will see is the upstart alliances' infrastructure and outposts destroyed if one of their members so much as farts in the megablocks' direction. db preacher: \"sirmolle, fred in the 'upstart alliance' just accused bob of being bullies on caod\"sirmolle: \"hmmm did he now. where do they live?\"dbp: \"they have an outpost in curse\"sirmolle: \"okay, summon the fleet, operation 'cleanse catch' is now underway. inform all our pilots. it will be a two week operation, we go in blow up their outposts and then head back to delve for some dyspro moon mining rnr. job done.\"dbp: \"that'll teach 'em\"okay - a slightly tongue in cheek example - but certainly a serious scenario. if smaller or 'upstart' alliances cannot defend their holdings against the superpowers then there will be absolutely zero incentive for them to put their assets at risk in 0.0 when they can be destroyed on mere whims.if people think 0.0 has too many napfests and mutual protection agreements now then just imagine what sort of self protection agreements people will seek in the future if their infrastructure could be at risk at the whim of the megablocks - we can kiss relatively independent or neutral alliances goodbye. as i mentioned above the 'superpowers' of eve already have the option of crushing those who oppose them but are held back by logistical considerations. they are also held back by the fact that deposed alliances have the 'opportunity' to regain and recapture their former holdings when the occupier has turned to focus on other things. currently the 'loser' has the option to harass and harry those who have vanquished them in an effort to regain their former outposts. what incentive would they have (apart from revenge) if those former holdings no longer exist?"
"as we saw when mc went on its rampage through the north (about a year ago) many of their conquests eventually returned to the hands of the people they had originally deposed. i know that on occasions mc (in its heyday) turned down contracts to assault smaller alliances because the 'contractor' had made no plans for the space once it had been 'captured'. these sort of considerations will not protect upstart or smaller alliances if outposts were destructible and could simply be 'griefed' as part of a 'scorched earth' approach.3) it completely ignores the risk vs reward balancethe op, possibly because he has never been a sov holder himself, does not seem to realise that sov holding alliances invest gigantic amounts of time in maintaining their defensive assets and infrastructure.yes there are rewards to living in 0.0 but those rewards are by no means shared equally across the 0.0 regions. people in regions such as providence or syndicate can only dream about the rewards of regions such as delve or fountain and to implement 'destructible outposts' on the premise that all 0.0 holders are making huge amounts of isk on the back of minimal risk is both incorrect, hugely inequitable and agenda driven.the simple fact is that in many regions of eve 0.0 the potential rewards are not outweighed by the risk. in fact quite the opposite. hell i can earn more conducting level 4 missions in ziriert (low sec empire) than i can npcing or mining in providence!but isk is only one element of 'investment' and i have already highlighted a much larger investment is made in the effort and game time that needs to be put into building the outposts and then maintaining their associated pos networks. anyone who has had the appropriate roles within a sov holding alliance will realise exactly how much of an effort and strain it is to keep poses refueled, armed and operating around the clock. the stack of evemails from poses squacking for attention must have to be one of the most unfun things anyone ever has to log into. yet people choose to do this because they are doing what eve is all about - building empires! the investment of these players into their empires is huge yet people do it because they percieve the current system - flawed though it may be - is reasonably fair. they can build their empire and have the chance to defend it. they can build their outposts and have the opportunity to make back the isk invested. the destructible outposts option removes that 'fairness'. it removes the balance between risk vs reward and removes the incentive of all but the most dedicated (or connected) to put the effort (isk and time wise) into developing 0.0!if people really do want to see outposts go boom then at least one or both of the following things have to happen:a) the effort/isk required to build and maintain infrastructure is significantly reduced by ccpb) the 'attacker' seeking to destroy an outpost has to put in significantly more time into the process than is proposed by the op - reflecting the time invested by the sov holder in its upkeep/maintenance."
"4) it will increase barriers to 0.0 useas already highlighted the introduction of destructible outposts could have some seriously negative consequences - particularly in limiting the ability of newer, smaller alliances to establish footholds in 0.0.it will also effect how 0.0 (particularly its markets) develop. while most 0.0 alliances currently operate nbsi not all do and even within nbsi groupings you will often find corps/individuals wo have bought blue standings in order to access 0.0 space, its resources, its markets and the opportunities that outpost provide for research, industry and production.outposts are the basis on which 0.0 is developing. they are the basis on which economies are developing in 0.0. do we really want to restrict all economic activity to empire or to the megablocks who have the ability to defend their outposts from random attacks from groups of pvpers who cannot be arsed to put any real effort in?i will talk about providence for a second because that is the 0.0 region that i know best. providence is to some extent a 'special case' as it is an nrds region - however it also provides a blueprint for how 0.0 can/will develop in the future.over 17 outposts have now been constructed in providence by alliances such as cva, lfs, paxton & sev3rance. these outposts have resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of residents in providence - not just in the sov holding alliances but also in numerous neutral and friendly corporations and individuals who have come to the region as a result of the infrastructure that is available.these new residents are using the facilities provided by these stations to develop industry, to develop a proper 0.0 market, to research, to build and to have a home! yes they are taking a risk. these outposts could be captured and their docking rights revoked and more importantly they are having to fly around in 0.0 where sentry guns or concord aren't going to come to their recue.as other 0.0 regions develop to a similar or more advanced state i see this trend continuing to a point where 0.0 does become a viable alternative home for eve's industrialists. but will these people come if the outposts from which they do business from, the outposts in which they store their assets were destroyable. i think not!we should be looking at ways to enhance and grow the populations of 0.0 - for any number of reasons - and i do not see that destructible outposts will do anything other than encourage industrialists to stay in empire or join the mega-block alliances who can reduce the 'risk' to acceptable levels."
"5) it will reduce pvpsome people seem to think that outposts offer some kind of security blanket for 0.0 residents. that all they do is encourage 'dock monkeys' - however if we really think people being able to dock to seek protection is a good reason for introducing destructible outposts then we may as well ban logging off and poses too.outposts attract people to 0.0. they encourage trade and industry. this means that more people are in 0.0 and more people are potential victims. yes some will dock - but would you rather be raiding space crawling with potential targets or raiding devastated regions devoid of activity apart from the occasional npcer who will simply warp to their pos the moment you enter local?outposts give people a reason to fight. they give people a reason to defend space and fight for it. they give people reasons to form gangs to fight raiders interedicting their outposts and their trade. making outposts destructible will simply reduce pvp opportunity - not enhance it! 6) it damages the 'history' of eveas an eve 'rper' i love the fact that outposts have histories, that every outpost has its story, the changes in ownership, the battles and wars fought over them. take fat or 9uy for instance, these names resonate with me because they have over time been home to epic encounters battles, sieges and counter sieges.that's why in my mind destroying outposts is the same as destroying eve history. outposts offer the one true player footprint on this game's history and i would be extremely saddened if we throw all of that away simply for a 'bigger bang'."
"alternativeswhilst i do not support the concept of destructible outposts as outlined by the op i do so based on the game's mechanics as they currently stand. as i have mentioned above i could potentially see fit to support destructible outposts if the requirements to build (and more importantly maintain) them were signifcantly reduced (but that is for a separate discussion) or if the attackers were required to invest significantly more time and resources into making them destructible to reflect the time and effort that has gone into building/capturing and maintaining them in the first place. for example attackers could be required to hold onto the station for an extended period (i.e. two weeks) during which they have to 'pack' the station with specific resources (reflecting the original isk investment in the station) in order to create a giant station destroying bomb and initiating a destruct countdown!another 'non-destructive' alternative which could give attackers a slightly more affordable and 'less demanding' way of inflicting pain on existing sov holders, would be to offer attackers the ability to decommission 'outposts' when they are captured - making them derelict/unusable for a specific period (i.e two weeks/month). if the original sov holder (or anyone else) manages to regain control they they would then need to make an investment of their own in order to recommission/refit the outpost and return it to active duty!conclusionas outlined above i do not believe the current system outpost is significantly unbalanced and believe that there are many more urgent issues which require the csm's attention which will have more impact on improving this game.i also believe the proposal as outlined by the op would have significant negative consequences on 0.0, its residents and anyone thinking of moving or working in 0.0 in the future.under the current sov mechanics it will completely wreck the risk vs reward balance and significantly reduce 0.0 politics, drama, excitement and interest turning 0.0 into an environment populated only by the megablocks and their pets.i wholeheartedly recommend that people reject this proposal and that the other csm members have the commonsense to prevent this proposal from moving forward to iceland!"
"i support destructable outposts,invulnerability devalues them, player built objects should always be destructable in 0.0 space. its maintaining continuity/emersion and doesnt lend to visions of outpost extinction.this overstates the gameplay varibles. you say the amount of outposts in 0.0 have taken years to colect, ofcourse it has, but now things are established we dont need the growth fast track any more. eve is designed to be a long haul game where gameplay must be robust to suvive many years in balance. outpost growth is far too asymeteric and will cause problems later. actually alot of things in this respect are broken, take capital ships for example but thats another discussion."
"i haven't read your post yet hardin, but i am going to comment on a few things from aboveactually the large alliance does not lose a single station in the above scenario. this is because its not in the others best interest to attack the larger entity.unlikely. smaller alliances have as much to gain by allying as they have to lose. allying leads to more power and blocks. but allying has less costs than fighting. hence the small alliances and large alliance all team up on one small alliance at a time. because they don't get redrawn continually. they get redrawn once. any \"continual\" redrawing will be large alliances moving the 0.0 situation back to the status quo that it settled at.no, if those stations were destructible bob would have destroyed them and we would have had no easy forward logistical base to attack them. we wouldn't have even got into delve.\"afford\" is a relative term. ships and modules and stations all have costs. ships have insurance to offset the loss. stations don't explode, leaving them as a foothold for any future alliance which wants to play the game. \"don't build what you can't afford to lose\" isn't the issue. the issue is that some parties want to increase the costs. i suppose you also support removing insurance for all tech 1 ships, because after all, \"don't fly what you can't afford to lose\"?think of outposts as part of the \"gameboard\" of 0.0. if you can destroy the game board, then new players can't join in, there is no where for them to go. you have increased the costs of entering into the game, but the risks are all relatively the same(losing access to station until you take it back more or less equals having station blown up since for all intents and purposes its now useless to you). this isn't a problem if the game has a set ending point where one side hits the win conditions. it is a problem when the game does not."
"for those championing the status quo, i'd ask two questions:1) if outposts had always been destructable, would it make sense to argue that they should be changed to be invulnerable?2) should poses be indestructable and instead just be captureable?"
"destructable outposts quite simply will lead to far far fewer alliances and corps in 0.0 and not more. super alliances will roll into an area and destroy thier enemies and destroy the outposts. they do not have to consider securing and defending the space they conquer. this change in mechanic would introduce an entire new concept of outpost griefing to eve. this griefing wont be done by small corps and small alliances as they currently cannot do it and changing this mechanic will not alter that particular aspect of gameplay. outpost griefing will be propogated by the very alliances that this \"change\" is intended to make life in 0.0 harder for. small alliances who spend weeks and months building outposts and setting up a defense network will see thier assests elimintated by the swarm or bob or aaa and will never again return to 0.0 and never again attempt to build something in null space.i find it terribly amusing that the most vocal and rabid champion for outpost destruction is from an alliance leader that has never built one, never defended one, never maintained a defensive network and never been a part of a corp or an alliance that was even remotely capable of destroying one.i support dynamism in 0.0 but unforutnately we have a zealot with a pet project with no actual experience trying to force feed a \"solution\" that doesnt solve anything on the eve community."
"it could work if it took more than a month or two. this would represent a serious commitment in manpower to hold the station for long enough. could be done by retreating alliances to deny them to the enemy as a valid tactic if they do not feel they would be able to retake it for some time or various other reasons. anything less than a month is certainly going to cause grief."
"1) yes2) nobtw. i am not arguing for the status quo. if you read my post you will see that i have suggested some alternatives. certainly the current system - particularly the amount of effort that goes into maintaining pos networks is insane and i do agree that 'attackers' do need other options to inflict 'damage' on sov holding alliances. i simply do not believe that destructible outposts (within the constraints of current game/sov mechanics) are a proper solution.this leads me back to my original point. why propose a change that will require gigantic balancing and effort from ccp on an issue which appears to have little appreciable benefit for the majority of eve players, when we could be focusing on the numerous little (more achievable) changes which will incrementally and collectively make eve a better game for us all?"
"1) yes! i'm not championing the status quo, i just disagree with jade's predictions about what will happen. in a few months when goons have blown all the small fish out of 0.0 and even less people go there, we will still want 0.0 to have more people, and thus more things happening. i'm a carebear; \"infrastructure brings people\" is my motto. don't really care who holds the infrastructure, as long as exists.2) i would say yes. we'd see more fights over them, i think, with the expense for the wars coming from the pewpew guy's pockets (all the dreads / bs'es being blown up) and less from the logistics / industrialist guy's pockets (cost of setting up poses), and perhaps even more traffic to 0.0 and/or small alliances taking over some of these things temporarily.the moons are static, let's face that. so why not call the pos \"part of the moon / site\" and just let people take control and / or abandon, if they so wish. what's the point of a moon? are we trying to preserve the pristine beauty of the eve landscape?yes, we're dotting the landscape with hardware. how about this: any pos will rust and self-destruct its tower and all its components if unfueled and unused for 30 days, just like cans. any outpost will blow itself out, too, if it's not used / claimed / visited by anyone for 30 days. let the things rust into nothingness. otherwise, indestructible, you can conquer them and use them if you so wish, but not destroy them.i would support that."
"nothing really to add to what hardin said, but to agree; destructable outposts does nothing to improve the situation in 0.0. it does nothing to help the smaller organizations succeed (over the status quo) in capturing outposts, it does everything to help larger organizations bail out of having to secure captured space.with current seige mechanics, there's little a smaller alliance can do in the face of a larger alliance once a larger alliance decides to conquer that smaller alliance. \"skill\" is rarely a factor in the inherently laggy environment of seige warfare, so sheer numbers tend to rule the outcome. with that in mind, the best a smaller alliance can do is maintain a powerful enough presence to fall into the category of \"not worth the trouble.\" the \"trouble,\" in this case, is not just taking space...but retaining space. take away that \"retaining\" requirement, and there's nothing stopping a larger alliance from rolling right over a smaller alliance...just because.smaller alliances being forced out of 0.0 because larger alliances can blow in and wreck outposts for no real reason other than to just do it doesn't strike me as a dynamic result. maybe dynamic for the couple of months it takes for all the smaller alliances to lose their outposts to the current powerblocks...but then a static pattern of smaller alliances trying to set up in unclaimed space, meeting the requirements for constructing an outpost, constructing said outpost, and then getting beat down by the first large alliance to notice and going back to whatever it was they were doing before they decided to take part in 0.0 politics (that they heard were now dynamic because outposts are destructible!)now, going back to another point hardin made: address other issues first! if the current state of seige warfare (he who brings the most caps/supercaps wins) can be altered somehow...maybe this is something that could be re-addressed. but seriously...if the only feasible means to keep an outpost alive is the ability to tactically defeat (rather than strategically deter) whomever the current superpower(s) might be, then folks are just gonna stop building outposts to begin with, and 0.0 will become more static than ever."
"second point first, i already suggested that a possible alternative in one of my other posts.first point, i have to disagree because i see that as massively assumptive. assumptive that once the larger powers move to sweep aside the smaller groups that a) they will succeed unmolested and b) once they do so nobody else other than existing 0.0 great powers will be able to force themselves into the area later due to the larger powers intervention.a) is debatable b) is wrong because there are plenty of nurseries for minor powers to learn their trade, regions with capturable stations like cloud ring and npc 0.0 regions, these have traditionally been staging posts for young alliances to springboard into 0.0, in some cases forcing older groups out and taking their outposts, in other building their own.also major powers some times fall apart all by themselves with no outside intervention."
"to me it seems the point of the proposal is about financial attrition.currently if an alliance loses an outpost only to regain it later, there's no financial loss, because the initial investment of the outpost was regained.but if an outpost is destroyed and rebuilt, isk has been drained from the economy.for the same reason that on a smaller level poses can be destroyed instead of simply captured, it makes sense for outposts to function the same way - the stakes are just higher.what am i missing there?"
"you're fudging in a part of the equation that is highly unlikely:nobody is going to build outposts if the only way to stop them from being blown up is to have the most capable capfleet. if there's no \"path to power\" simply because the current powerblocs have any easy way to prevent anyone from taking that path...then nothing will change. the only way to compete on a 0.0 level will be to have the same level of power as the current powerblocs who have been building that power in 0.0 for years...power that was gained because they were actually able to start from scratch without having their efforts erased by somebody else without consequence.nobody will have the desire to build (and certainly not rebuild) an outpost just to see it blown up because \"x\" powerbloc was bored and decided to do it, knowing the only responsibility tied to conquering the outpost would be blowing it up."
"outposts cannot defend themselves and teh proposed time frame to take an outpost is a week to switch sov. that could be a long holiday in one country affecting alliance strength to come back to all their stuff is crapped. something that took a month or more i am not opposed to. most alliances would need an actual purpose to seige a region for 1 or 2 months to blow up outposts from upstarts to prevent having to deal with them later.make it take a month to enable the option or let outposts fit tons of guns and such that make it a conquerable objective and an amazing amount of shield regen not just shield strength and why not. as it is i don't think the mechanic is so broken it needs this much attention to improve this aspect. general 0.0 lagfest and captials online seem like more worthy efforts."
"everything.there's no such thing as financial attrition where outposts are concerned. they're not (and haven't been for about 2 years) money makers. they're not transferrable. the isk is \"lost\" the second you put it up. financial attrition is all about mining pos destruction. nothing can compare to the impact of losing 2-3 dyspro moons inside a couple of weeks. (and let's face it - even small alliances can throw 20b away every few weeks without batting an eyelid)outposts are absolutely and entirely strategic assets. they're a place to safely shelter, repair and restock both your capital and conventional fleets. they provide a base from which you can push forward.again to use goonswarm as an example. had outposts been destructible, there would now only be the poorly-placed conquerables, 3 per region, between delve and cache. bob could have retreated back to delve, happy in the knowledge that anyone who wanted to realistically attack them from that front would have to spend months and months attaining sov 3 in every strategic system and re-erecting outposts so that they had the infrastructure to attack.instead, the infrastructure was left in place and bob were left stretched across a dozen regions. they simply could not defend that space, but they still had to! you cannot allow your opponents to gain the security of a well placed outpost.destruction of the infrastructure allows you to exert a hold equivalent to holding the outposts under current mechanics long after you've left the space. then, simply through the virtue of being the dominant power, whenever anyone even thinks about putting up new outposts, you can crush them, as you hold the monopoly on secure space."
"can't this argument be made about poses on a smaller level?"
"yes, and it does. how many people do you see putting up individual poses in bob's space? however, it's not stricty relevant. poses aren't as effective as strategic tools as outposts are, they don't allow you to exert the same kind of influence an outpost does."
"is the objection then just about the price of the outpost? i would think that simply bringing down the cost of erecting an outpost to suitably balance the loss of invulnerability would be all that's needed to allow it to be brought in line with everything else in the eve universe that is destructible and shouldn't be built/flown unless you can afford to lose it.if the cost of outposts were rebalanced along with the introduction of self-destruct capability, what objections would there be at that point?"
"assests stored inside outposts can easily equal teh cost of the outpost in long held systems.2 or 3 builders can have assets this size. i am normally dirt poor but we can have a billion in ships on the market and mineral stockpiles that could not be moved out in the time frame implied. we are small timers though. others would have significantly bigger losses. the issue then becomes don't fly what you can't afford to lose but instead don't put stuff where it could be permanently destroyed. at least with current outposts it still exists even if you can't get to it.otherwise if an outpost is say 3 bil instead of 20 bil and easiser to put up then go for it. if it is a less crippling blow to lose one then it could be balanced."
"cost doesn't and shouldn't come into any balance discussion in eve. it's really not significant, at all.the value of outposts exists in their strategic importance, but more importantly, the denial of strategic control to your opponents that an outpost grants you. to access that denial of strategic control, you must commit to holding and defending the outpost.if you can destroy the outpost rather than having to defend it, you can attain the same level of effectiveness without the same level of investment. (that is investment in terms of pilot time as i said, cost doesnt come into it.)it just isn't balanced, and gives too much power to the established, already dominant powers who would no longer have to extend themselves to control dozens of regions at a time.ed: again, by \"control dozens of regions..\" i really mean deny control of the regions to potential opponents. it's just as, if not more, important."
"if you lowered teh requirements for an outpost across the board it would be fine. just expect every system tha can have one to have one like a giant pos then. become more like corp outposts instead of alliance outposts. why build a pos when an outpost will let you store more ships or melt ore/ice faster."
"so long as people can later retrieve whatever was in their hangar, then thumbs up."
"this isn't an issue with the example solution i proposed in the op. personal hangers would still be accessible from the derelict outpost post self destruction."
"the objections would then likely change to \"flavor of the game\" type objections. eve becoming fast-paced capture the flag in space or whatever instead of a political/strategic/economic simulator where building something that lasts actually matters.but, yes, what you propose would at least be \"balanced.\""
"okay that makes sense, so let's focus on the flavor argument.the charge of \"capture the flag in space\" actually applies far more accurately to indestructable outposts rather than destructable ones.when outposts are destroyed and rebuilt, economic/political/strategic factors come into play - when they are invulnerable it's just a game of king of the hill."
"currently, the considerations for taking an outpost are \"can we take it\" and \"can we hold it.\" the former is usually a more tactical consideration, the latter bears almost all of the economic/political/strategic weight.your proposal removes the \"can we hold it\" consideration.how does that make the game more economic/political/strategic? if we have learned anything with eve, it's that there are a whole lot of players and organizations who do stuff for no better reason than \"because they can.\" if people are given the option to take out outposts \"because they can\" without having to consider much else at all, how does that improve gameplay and atmosphere?"
"i see what you're getting at, but the balance of what you're laying out is thrown out of whack by the fact that new outposts can be constructed.suppose we were having this argument about moons, and someone was proposing that players be able to field a \"moonbuster\" weapon to destroy high value moons in order to deny them to their enemies. then all of the arguments you're fielding would ring incredibly true.likewise if outposts were seeded throughout 0.0 and new ones couldn't be built, then it would make sense to treat them like counterstrike capture points and argue that to destroy them would lead to a scorched-earth empty and lifeless 0.0.however that is not the case - outposts are analagous to poses, not to moons. destroying an outpost is not tantamount to destroying the gameboard, it's simply destroying a piece on the board. in a linear game with an end like monopoly the board can eventually be covered in hotels - eve is not like that, it needs to live and breathe and grow and crumble and grow again."
"i don't think that the proposal does, it simply adds another variable, if we cant hold it permanently, can we hold it long enough to destroy it.yes the lulz crowd certainly exist, but every age has had its barbarians, i would expect though that an organized alliance would be both better able to defend itself against such and better able to recover from their assaults. however, i can understand that a hard working alliance who have put everything into gaining and maintaining sov and building their empire from nothing would be more than a little ****ed off at the prospect of a gtc fueled lulz fleet descending like a pack of locusts simply to destroy stations for the bang. for that reason, i am inclined to say that hardin's prereqs for destruction being an equal or greater cost than the construction of a station might be necessary to make it prohibitively expensive to do it just for kicks and because you can. it would also i think be a requirement to isk sink that purchase by making the demolition tools npc sales only.in such a case destroying it for tactical or strategic reasons may still make sense regardless of the huge cost, but only fools will buy enough gtcs to do the job for kicks."
"the case most folks are making that do not support outpost destruction is quite simply that destructable outposts will not serve this function. the reason doesn't change: if people can blow up outposts without having to plan for any considerations beyond the destruction of the outpost itself, then no rational person not belonging to a powerbloc is ever going to build an outpost again.one particular function destructable outposts would serve is for empire based organizations to potentially cause crippling economic and strategic damage to a 0.0 based organization...while leaving the 0.0 organization completely without strategic recourse (taking out the stations the empire based organization stages out of.) that might also strike people as a problem."
"one of the most well known lulz crowds currently in existence is, love 'em or hate 'em, one of the most powerful organizations in the game. i suppose when goons start knocking over outposts because they can now do so without having to care what happens to the system, it will be the fault of the victims that they were badly organized and unable to better defend themselves against a 5000 strong alliance..."
"i don't think you can make that blanket statement - after all, does it not come down to risk vs. reward? if a 0.0 organization reaches a point in it's rise to power at which it feels it can both benefit from an outpost and defend it against attack/recover from its loss, it would be rational to build one. if outposts were destructable this point would still be reached, it would simply be another factor in the calculations of risk vs. reward.this is an interesting point - however does this not also apply to pos? an empire organization can currently strike at 0.0 pos and the pos owner is in an identical situation. if it is okay for pos why not for outpost?"
"partly because the comparison between an empire station and a pos is a weak one, and partly because a lot of empire based folks can and do have poses anyway. at least that possibility for recourse exists. or, perhaps more clearly, if you take out my pos in 0.0 and you have one of your own in lowsec, i can take it out. if you take out my pos in 0.0 and don't have one of your own in lowsec...you're not benefitting from it anyway. however...if you take out my outpost and don't have one of your own, it might be because you're based out of an empire station and are benefitting from having \"an outpost\" without actually risking one."
"this for me is the strongest argument against, we all want to leave our mark and eve uniquely amongst mmos gives us a single contiguous history from the first pilots to log into the game to the latest noob. when i first began to play eve, i was awestruck by this, even things like anchored cans in empty high sec systems, giving tribute to fallen comrades gave me a certain feeling of awe. this, i told myself was a game with real history. yet sadly, to me at least, all those cans, those little marks and scratchings that previous generations of pod pilots had left to welcome my noob self to this universe have now been tidied up to reduce lag. when i first began to run the odd mission and came across ones with wrecked and ruined stations, i wondered why they were there, what was the history of this burned out caldari station in gallente territory, only to be saddened to realise that there was none, it was a randomly generated mission location that would despawn once the mission was over.i really can see where you are coming from with the history and story of the outposts, but i don't think that has to go, any destroyed station should leave a permanent ruin. something for noobs to stare at in awe hearing that for years battle raged between two implacable foes until the holders fell and the station was put to the torch.i'd even go so far as to demand that ccp allow players to build and permanently anchor expensive memorials nearby, with the ability to enter an explanation of what happened there all that time ago."
"would you think it fine if capital ships or just super-capitals or just titans were indestructable? why have assets that can be destroyed at all?would you think it fine if pos were indestructable? or only capturable?getting your capital fleet destroyed certainly doesn't lead to growth or self-reliance, it has exactly the same effects that people are arguing against destructable outposts for. the fact that they have something to lose is what drives people to form powerblocs and huddle in the blob together, they are minimizing risk. this risk is also the vital compotent that makes eve what it is. big fat bloated powerblocs are already happening, and adding outposts to the list of things that might explode if you use have them will not change this one little bit. superpowers \"griefing\" smaller entities will happen anyway, they don't need to hold what they conquer. they can choose to sell it, abandon it or install a pet.care to list the independant space holding alliances? they don't exist, and the closest you get are in the armpits of claimable 0.0.outposts shouldn't be forever. nothing players build should be."
"im going to disagree with this simply on the point that its bloody unfair to change the rules of the game 3/4 years down the line from when alliances first started building outposts.many alliances when they first considered building outposts had many considerations. 1) cost. 2) difficulty to build the outpost egg. 3) getting the resources needing to be placed in the egg to the target system where outpost will be deployed. this requires effort, team work and massive commitment over an extended period of time. then hours need to be spent filling the egg in target system (especially back in the time before freighters could be used at pos's, so hauling to eggs had to be done with regular haulers).that is a serious amount of time and effort just to build. on top of that, they have to deploy multiple pos's in the system before hand and spend weeks building up sovereignty, and defending those poses and contiunously fueling those pos's which in itself costs significant amounts of isk on a regular and sustained basis.the decision to build an outpost is based on what it takes to build it, to haul and deploy, compared to what it can bring you for that reward. that reward was a permanent outpost there no matter if you got kicked out of there later.these are the variables allince took before building outposts. it simply is not fair to change the rules after they have made the decision. it destroys long term alliance planning, and it makes a joke of the effort and time taken in deploying it.this goes for all things really.ccp set 0.0 with a certain set of mechanics. people have played for 5 years based on those rules, and based what they have done on those rules. it simply is not fair to change the rules now have the investment of hundreds of billion of isk has been made, unless you keep those outposts permanent and change the rules for outposts deployed after a certain date. people should know the facts before making an investment."
"but the outpost-dweller also has access to empire stations, so that's a wash isn't it? and really, it's the space that the outpost is in that is valuable - the rats, the belts, the moons, and those are still there no?i see what you're saying about the true benefit of an outpost being the strategic advantages it gives - but i don't see why those advantages can't be factored into the risk/reward equation in balancing destructable outposts - including how difficult they are to conquer and explode."
"i am going to disagree. the powerblocks will keep whatever space they want for themselves, rent out what they feel is a good return and burn the rest. abandoning outposts? why would that happen if you could destroy them? so only the very finest areas of 0.0 should have outposts and encourage growth? with the mechanics as they are considering this now is quite premature."
"if you put yourself in the firing line then i suppose you have to take some of the blame. i dont think we should be playing in safety blanket mode simply so that small alliances are protected from the depradations of the wolves. there are 250,000 (+/- a few) other players, the goons, regardless of their notable attitudes, might well be able to knock over a small/medium/large alliance or two but they have already burned up a lot of the good will people felt towards them for taking on bob.i think that going on an epic escapade across 0.0 blowing up every station they came across would see a rapid coalescence of opposition to their particular brand of humour. it might even turn into a truly epic war that the last great war could have been but in the end failed to be. (from my perspective at least)"
"well you shot your own argument down. now that freighers can do the job, there isn't a lot of time or effort involved. and the cost isn't anything astronomical either.by the same logic titans would need to be invulnerable because they also require a lot of money and a lot of hauling."
"make every strategic staging location destructable and i'm out of arguments, frankly. as it stands, everybody who does pvp risks something in the fight. however, zooming out to the strategic picture, not everybody capable of destroying an outpost, were it possible, risks an outpost themselves. that might be an interesting concept, actually, but a whole other discussion. right you are. contrary to the op's opinion that it might.they need to do something with what they conquer. they need an ally, a customer, a plan to hang onto it themselves, something. but if they can just choose to blow it up...then they need nothing. they don't need to consider anything. they can just do it. and then suddenly instead of fighting for outposts and space for strategic/economic/political considerations, you have people blowing up outposts \"just because.\" the current considerations for strategic conquest in eve is a fairly defining part of the game i figure."
"what does that matter? they certainly should be able to burn the rest. it changes nothing for the little guy.the fact that parts of 0.0 are entirely worthless is a whole different problem altogether, and has nothing to do with outposts. space of value will be taken and not left to whomever. the independant \"little guy\" is every bit as much out on his ass."
"i think that we are arguing in circles, at this point.the two main opposing points seem to be:1. everything that players build should be destructible.vs. 2. destroying an outpost should take as much time and cash as it took to build it.the devil is in the details; specifically, how much time and effort destroying an outpost should take. there have been several proposals that seem to want a 1 month hard coded minimum time limit, opposing jade's original proposal of 72 hours.i'm opposing the 72 hours thing, it is a laughably short period of time considering how much effort and hard-coded waiting time it takes to build one of these things. if you want to have a 30-day countdown, during which you can hold the outpost and defend it so you can blow it up, while the previous owners attack it so they can take it back, be my guest. 30-days, though."
"how about a week?"
"now they can yes, but many of those outposts when deployed did not have this option. my simple point stands, it is unfair to change the rules after the fact. super caps have never been said \"these are indestructable\". outposts have, and have been built for that reason.if ccp change it so all outposts which have been constructed are destructable now they lose all credibility. if they want destructible outposts, draw a line in the sand and all built already remain so, the cost of outpost construction reduced and difficulty in deploying reduced.it is the only fair way to do it in light of people who have deployed already."
"that's why i have come to agree with hardin's caveat, make it cost a ****load of isk to destroy outposts, so much that an alliance would have to decide between blowing that outpost, building an outpost of their own in their own space or another mothership and fittings etc..."
"heh heh, how about a year, and we can negotiate and reach a compromise of 6 months. i'll throw in the \"stuff inside\", it can blow up along with the outpost."
"i don't see how. assuming destructable outposts; outpost dweller can lose outpost. empire dweller with sufficient means can kill outpost. outpost dweller cannot strike back at empire dweller on an equivalent level. outpost dweller ends up back in empire having risked/lost outpost...empire dweller continues living in empire having taken out outpost and risking/losing nothing of the sort.(yes, during the fight both sides risked ships and lost ships...but once all the risking and losing of equivalent assets is all done, if the outpost owning organization loses...they further lose an asset that the empire dwelling organization never risked to begin with.)"
"the op's opinion on what effect it would have has no bearing on whether this is a good idea or not.and by choosing destruction they lose out on a potential source of income, there isn't exactly a shortage of pets as best as i can tell. its for this very reason that outposts aren't just abandoned all over the place. they have value. destroying them comes at a cost.conquering outposts isn't something you do \"just because\" as it is already. pos warfare isn't exactly considered fun. and obviously someone shouldn't be able to just rock up at your outpost with a roaming fleet one night because they are bored, destroy the outpost and then skip home for tea and medals. this should be taken into account when balancing the actual mechanic."
"i am clearly all for 1.as far as 2 is concerned, destroying it might just cost more in terms of losses sustained in the process of. this however isn't a constant and shouldn't be.we don't need to concern ourselves with the detailed balance of the mechanic in terms of time, its a complete waste of time. ccp's game designers will do this themselves anyway, and arguing about these details are entirely pointless. the question is simply: should outposts be destructable?but just because i can't resist, i'd say a month is much too long, if it is timed from the moment the outpost is conquered."
"and then the question is: was the reward the outpost-dweller gained from living in 0.0 worth the loss of the outpost? just in the same way that taking a ratting battleship into 0.0 is a risk but could result in some reward.all the other elements of eve follow this formula - i think it makes perfect sense to bring outposts in line with it, and there needs to be a convincing argument why outposts should be an exception."
"fair point. why do you think it's a good idea, then? what benefit to the game would be brought about by making outpost destruction a reality?"
"worth remembering that while 72hours may sound like a laughably short period of time - this clock doesn't even start ticking until you have won a conventional sovereignty battle and already own the outpost. further, there is another 48 hours on the clock till it blows up (during which time it opts out of sovereignty and can be recaptured by any friendly fleet that cares too). now, this was just a rough example illustrating \"how\" the destructible outpost concept could be delivered. its not our job as players (or csm reps) to design this detail - thats up to ccp. but what it is our job to do is to ask questions on the principle here (as i stated in the op). i would like to ask ccp if they see a role for destructible outposts in the 0.0 game? many players of eve online would also like an answer to this question. (if they tell us in reply they don't see a role for destructible outposts thats pretty much the end of the matter). so i'd like to pose a specific question now of anyone opposing this issue getting a place on the agenda: why are you against the principle of simply discussing this? why don't you want us to talk about it? why do you believe that destructible outposts in 0.0 space must be a taboo issue?"
"i realllllyyyyyyyyyyyy want this to happen.p.s. i just doomed this thread again."
"this has been done several times in the thread."
"outposts are an exception to the rule in eve. loss is an important factor of what makes eve tick. i see no reason for this exception to exist. its not a sandbox if the sandcastles can't be stepped on ...and i worship big explosions."
"well you've said why you think it would be bad for x,y,z reason which may or may not make sense from your own perspective. but you haven't said why you won't trust ccp to make a sensible decision on this score if its raised as an issue for formal discussion."
"and this."
"this is what i absolutely agree with."
"this process is to decide what we feel is important for ccp to look at, not something else. many have said no and given reasons. do not turn this into something it is not."
"i think a big concern is that outpost destruction would make sand-castle stepping a much more attractive alternative to sand-castle building...which can be equally destructive to the fun-factor of a sandbox.jade, i think hardin addressed your question quite directly in his far more thorough post: there are hotter issues to the balance of the game. for instance, if sovereignty and seige mechanics can be addressed to a point that seige warfare is a lot more fun/playable, then 0.0 would become more dynamic without introducing a new mechanic that could be far too easily abused (and make 0.0 a lot less dynamic) as things currently stand."
"yep and many have spoken and said yes. i guess ultimately it'll be good to ask ccp the question right?"
"in that case there's no reason not to bring it up with ccp alongside those other concerns - they can tell us if they are already planning something else that they think would be better to try first and come back to the destructability question later.i agree with jade's point that there's nothing to be gained by not asking about it."
"jade, i have no issue with destructible outposts being introduced as a different kind of outpost to current.current outposts should not be destructible. my main issue is that it is not fair on outpost owners to have the rules changed on them after they have weighed up all the pros and cons and decided to go ahead with it.can you honestly think of a fair way to make current outposts destructable without screwing up hundreds of billions of isk invested by people in something which ccp says \"these cannot be destroyed\"."
"well options are better than \"no options\" right? because at the moment these is no option beside conquering and becoming outpost holders. a true sandbox game should not restrict gameplay to only one optimal path, it should allow players to use creative solutions and decide how they want to play the game. why do you think its a good idea to force roving pvp powers to become territorially rooted if they want to hurt their enemies for example? i don't agree of course. i think at the moment 0.0 territorial warfare and stagnation and lack of balance (ie massive defense advantage) is one of the single hottest issues in the game. i believe destructible outposts could go a long way to redressing this imbalance and i would like to hear ccp's opinion on this. and i think a lot of other players would also be interested in hearing this opinion and about ccp's future intentions in this regard."
"ccp has enough problems distracting themselves with new features before fixing old ones. let's not complicate things with csm also throwing in new feature ideas.what i'd like to see csm approach ccp with is a unified front of \"the playerbase wants you to fix your game first.\""
"ccp rarely does anything right, and destructible stations would be used for completely different reasons than you are thinking about. name one time where a large alliance lost a station because they ignored it and then retook it in 4-7 days? the closest i can think of is a large alliance losing a station for about 2-3weeks and taking it back and even then there was major fighting.as i stated earlier, the only purpose this would serve would be large alliances walking in and destroying smaller alliances' outposts because they dont want the logistical nightmare of running it. even then they'd probably rather sell the station and make some isk off it.i think it be pretty fun though.oh and they probably wont ever do it because of the programing nightmare it would become with clones / ships and possible exploits etc."
"wrong. at this stage the reps will have to decide and vote on it, as i understand. if it achieves enough support from he reps then it goes to ccp. they can then decide to take action on it or blow the idea off."
"how? seriously. reasons have been given why this would very likely lock out a lot of folks from 0.0. how do you think destructable outposts will fix the \"stagnation\" of 0.0?"
"i think with the current sovreignty mechanics we are safe from that one... but yes, and that's a balance issue. i would agree that fixing pos warfare should be a higher priority, but that's very much up to ccp. this is however important enough to get on their list. tell you what, implement destructable outposts at the same time as fixed pos war."
"rules change, balance is adjusted, there are winners and losers in this process but the game goes on. i liked double-mwd calvary ravens back in the gnw with the best of them - but ccp decided that was unbalanced and changed the rules. perhaps titans will be changed in the near future (they already have been once) - point is that ccp is within its rights (and our interest) to address unbalanced mechanics on the live server. i really don't believe that your argument holds water since outposts today have been buffed immensely since introduction in dozens of ways - simply removing the indestructibility training wheels is not an unfair counter adjustment. i believe the example i cited in the op would be a fair way to go about it. when outposts were introduced you had no jump-bridges, titans, cyno-jammers and all the rest to do the logistics for you. today erecting outposts is a task many many times easier to achieve that when they were introduced and they are much cheaper in relative terms than the earliest prototypes. 0.0 today is massively more secure for the territorial holder than it was. destructible outposts would be in my opinion, a reasonable counterbalance for a situation that has been skewed in the favour of the defender for far too long."
"well that is one way of looking at the csm - but just looking at the topics up for votes and issues posted by players on this forum, new ideas are a pretty big part of what players want from the csm. i think that's a much broader argument that perhaps should be had, but it's not directly pertinent to this issue."
"again, how? just to use an example: what would you have done differently against, say, sever3nce if right now outposts were suddenly destructable? how would that have changed the situation for star fraction and ushra'khan at all in that war?now let's turn the tables and say star fraction had an outpost or two (not talking ideology here, just size comparison) and cva wanted to come knocking. now, cva have plenty of crap to take care of in our own space...but it sure would be nice to take out some sf outposts, yeah? if we don't have to hold on to those outposts, if we can just roll in, execute a month-long campaign, push a button and it's all gone...we're gonna be a lot more likely to execute that campaign than if we have to try and figure out a way to include 2 new outposts into our logistical scheme as well as provide adequate protection. destructable outposts allows us to take on a campaign that, under current mechanics, isn't worth the trouble (or, more to the point, would over-stretch our capabilities.)so the way i see it, destructable outposts does nothing to strengthen smaller alliances in the face of larger alliances and does everything to allow already powerful alliances to actually over-reach their grasp and improves their ability to push around the smaller alliances.how does that improve the situation at all?"
"lots of the folks that \"agree\" with jade's obsession site the \"if you can build it it should destroyable\". if that is the reason for a \"yay\". than i reckon the reasoned approach which balances the builders investment with the destroyer's investment is fine-as long as in the end you can still make it go boom!i propose a modification to jade's proposal to reflect hardin's point of making it cost as much to destroy as to build. and/or a modification that after holding the outpost for 60 days you can at any time make it go boom!if the driving force behind support for jade's obessision is the fundamental principal that that which shall be built shall be destroyed-i suspect that many of the yay's would favor such a \"price\" for destruction.and i certainly echo the sentiments of many of the goonies and others that there are more pressing, game breaking issues in eve than taking outposts and making them destroyable. but alas! our chairman is more interested in shaping eve to jade fraction's vision than he is in improving the game. or more likely-he is so convinced that jade fraction's play style is the right and proper way to play and therefor we should all be forced to play as he and his merry men do.a very big - although not surpising disappointment in the csm process. rather fascinating to me that the two alliances that outpost destruction would benefit most bob and goonies more or less oppose this. certainly thier members on the committee are responsible enough to the csm program to put the good of eve ahead of thier indivudal agendas and play styles. can you imagine this process if each member was vigorously and self servingly proposing and defending agenda items that only served thier corporation and alliance interests as jade continues to do in virtually every post and thread?"
"there is already so much risk involved with living in 0.0. why should someone now risk losing all their station assets if they go on vacation for a week? as it is now, you can always sell what you have stuck in a station, or retake it, or join a corp that does have access. you're now discussing eliminating the assets permanently or making them unreachable until someone pays an excessive fee. if you want to increase the risk of living in 0.0 so dramatically, then the reward should be larger, much larger. of course this would cause inflation, but oh well, you empire squatters can only think of the 'epic loot cans' and big explosions because you live in areas with no risk. you want to harvest the loot and tears of those who live in 0.0 while taking no comparable risk yourselves. having destructible outposts is a surefire way to decrease the population of 0.0 and reserve it only for large power blocks. is this what you want? large powers will raze undesirable 0.0 for the luls, force out everyone who is small and unaligned to a major block. even if assets are still available in some form (eg salvage), the area becomes unlivable. living out of a pos is unacceptable to most of eve (its terrible). have you actually lived out of a pos? i'm not talking about basing out of one for a week while you **** up someone's territory. i'm talking about producing ammo, mods, and ships from one and flying back to one from empire if you happen to get podded. i must say that i'm not surprised that an empire hugger would come up with these ideas and become attached to them like some asperger's patient. living in a station 5 jumps from lowsec in providence is very different from living in one 35 out. you have no idea what you are talking about. do you want to discuss the advantages of running level 4 missions in empire against that of maintaining and sustaining a 0.0 empire? do you know anything of fueling all those poss or organizing a defense against aggression? do you know anything of the political forces that threaten 0.0 alliances internally and externally? do you even know how profitable 0.0 space is or what it costs to run it? or do you just sit in your armchair dreaming of popping a dread with 50 stealth bombers? to reiterate my main point. you are suggesting that 0.0 residents should accept more risks and more threats for something that is not much more advantageous and profitable than highsec/piratesec. you want them to accept this risk (for no gain) while you accept none."
"sounds great!"
"larger alliances being able to take and destroy smaller alliances' outposts simply because there's no longer any political/economic/strategic reason not to doesn't sound so great to me. doesn't sound like something that will stimulate dynamic 0.0 either. sounds like something that will further encourage naptrains and blobs and discourage smaller alliances from participating in 0.0 at all.except, of course, those that exist solely to destroy outposts from the safety of empire."
"when outposts were introduced and soverignty was introduced based on pos warfare, how long did it take to destroy a single pos? how many capital ships were around, how many dreadnaughts were around? they were a limited factor designed to help pos warfare.now, it is possible for 100 dreadnaughts to be fielded against a pos. it is now faster and easier to destroy poses than ever before, and harder to defend against.to combat this and help alliances stop being steamrolled new mechanics were introduced. did this make living in 0.0 easier. possibly. were they intended to be used as an outpost buff? no, they were introduced to make pos warfare more managable.new features should not be looked at in stand alone situations. \"cyno jammers and jumpbridges make logistics easier\". lets remove them shall we. we now have a system where dozens of dreadnaughts enter a system at will, reinforce all towers in very feasibly under an hour, to reinforce as many poses as seige cycle allows. then 2 and a half days later, they return, and destroy those poses even faster (whats the record for a pos being destroyed out of reinforced, i believe its under 5 mins).so an alliance does this and next down time sov drops. lets look at the time scale on this, 3 days from initial suprise strike to sov dead.outposts have not changed, their value has not changed, the effort in putting one up may gotten easier but this is in balance to the effort neccessary to defend them. the mechanics surrounding their defence has changed in a response to the changing circumstances of the eve environment in which those mechanics apply.your argument is flawed becaused it is basing the argument to make outposts destroyable based on the development of pos warfare, which developed in a way which was neccessary, and although not neccesarily balanced, has not impeded 0.0 warfare to a great effect, in a way which was not intended to boost outposts.cyno jammers and jump bridges are not restricted to solely outpost systems, reliant upon the existance of an outpost. if they were, then i might just let you look at outposts in relation to these mechanics in isolation to the rest of eve. however, just because you cannot drop 100 dreadnaughts and destroy a system, does not mean that someone, or hell, even everyone else in 0.0 cant do that.give outposts defences, give them a major major major boost, i.e. 20 corp offices each, all services at a good quality and then you can trade off these boosts against it being utterly destroyable.what annoys me most about this is that you are looking at these mechanics and how they compare to other mechanics in isolation of the wider circumstances. simply answer this question: considering that outposts were given destructible station services which means they can be effectivly made useless which in essence for outposts was a nerf, in what way are outposts unbalanced and needing to be made destructable? how have they recieved any buffs that are not simply in response to another issue, where any bonus they recieve is a side issue of the bigger picture.when they were introduced they had a purpose, and have the exact same purpose today. they have not changed, you say they are cheaper in relative terms, how are they? just because time has gone on and people have made empires the way ccp intended, using the mechanics they intended to make living in the valuable parts of 0.0 profitable doesnt means things are any cheaper.what concerns me most though is that if you, the person making this thread, had any experience in pos maintanence, pos networks,building and owning and operating outposts, then you would not be making this thread. you are looking at 0.0 mechanics and saying \"this is how this works and this is unfair rabble rabble rabble\" instead of actually going out and experiencing all these things you are complaining about."
"nobody reads the last post on a page, so i quoted for you"
"this sounds more like a laundry list of bogeymen than anything that actually relates to the topic unfortunately.i don't think there's anything wrong with abiding by the eve philosophy that everything built by players can be destroyed, and if you can't afford to lose it, don't undock. isn't bringing player constructed outposts in line with everything else in the game a valid issue to ask ccp for a response on? these small alliance/large alliance arguments don't follow logically at all - there will always be a cost-benefit analysis and a risk:reward ratio to consider.after all if what you suggest about the fate of destructable outposts were true, why haven't the goons swarmed across eve destroying every pos a smaller alliance has out there?"
"i'm not picking on you here ikar, but you'll find it much easier to build a compelling argument if you avoid making it about the person raising the issue. especially as in this case when your conclusions are so completely flawed as a result. i've told you why i believe this is an issue that should be raised to ccp and why we should seek their answer on the issue of destructible outposts in 0.0. its your task (if you wish to debate productively in this thread) to tell me why you don't think it is sensible to raise this issue and ask this question. ill-judged attacks on the eve-experience of the op won't convince anybody. but to address the point that you're trying to make - no ikar, i don't believe that boring and repetitive tasks should be rewarded with increased defense bonuses and invulnerability in-game. if pos and outpost management is a terribly boring gameplay element then by all means raise an issue to discuss that alongside potential solutions."
"good question."
"no its a dumb question. you're equating killing some insignificant cheap tower in bodunk no-where with the grief caused by destroying a station. its a worthless argument, grats for quoting it."
"hold on. so on a post i wrote in a response to the points you raised about why this should go ahead your telling me to just argue why destructible outposts shouldnt be discussed.last time i checked this was a discussion.you have made claims about outposts being buffed in over a dozen ways, as a validation for why they should be made destructable. but you havent explained why this is.you are seizing upon the same issues and twisting them in several ways without putting them into the wider eve picture, looking at why these features have been introduced and for what purpose.this is your case to defend, not mine to attack, especially when you dont respond when i do attack.and i think that it is a valid point about the op experience in something they are suggesting be changed. especially when just because you are posting it means that it comes up on the agenda."
"because this is not what you were elected for.you were elected to be a check on ccp. a way to bring actual issues to ccp and force them to respond on a personal level. this is entirely something you want that will further your personal agenda.you have not established how this would help the game, nor how it would help the common man. you're abusing your ill-gotten position as csm chair to bring your personal agenda into something that should have absolutely nothing to do with what you think.i don't understand how this has 7 pages of discussion. are outposts an \"[issue]\"? no, they're not. they're a point which causes and promotes extreme levels of combat in deep 0.0. if that's an issue in this game, then **** me what've we been doing for 4 years?"
"how is it a good question? a pos requires a flat fee from an npc station, it can be taken out and deployed in 1-2 hours and ready to go. an outpost takes weeks of planning, deploying of poses, collecting sov, hauling components, building of egg, securing travel to 0.0 system. it is a much bigger target and much more ego-inflating to kill. and you can only have 1 per system."
"what? it's a terrible question, and one i've already covered.poses and outposts are not comparable. poses are not strategically significant, but outposts are. does a pos allow an entire alliance the ability to project their power across multiple constellations? no. does it take weeks of planning and building to construct? no. and as i've already said, the isk involved in an outpost is fairly insignificant on the alliance scale - so how significant do you think poses are in the grand scheme of things?"
"give the man a medal!absolute no.this entire issue has been twisted away from what is should be about.no one here needs to defend why they should be indestructable, people need to prove why they should be destructable.from everything ive read its:1) i want big bangs2) i think it would improve the 'flow' of 0.03) i want big bangsand all of this, created and cheer leadered by people for whom by there very nature hate system holding in all its forms.honestly - its not about balance, its a personal agenda plain and simple. if people from the major 0.0 alliances suggested it - fine - they really know what its all about - they live it everyday.are major alliances asking for this?no - they are asking for less lag and sorting out capital blobs.this post is really not a personal attack at you jade. at least no more than your creation of this thread isnt to forward your own personal agenda."
"this is a great suggestion if you want more people in jita and less people in 0.0/lowsec.thumbs up for star fraction."
"now i know what a good number of you may be thinking. stop napfesting! in my case the lobby is in the other direction. we need more reds! yes, this is a proposal that is of direct and immediate benefit to those of us who practice nrds (not red don't shoot)the game has grown substantially, the standing slots (which i believe stand at 300) are simply not adequate for the current population or the growth rate of the game. hostiles who hide in npc corps all need separate standings. corps and alliances that drift in an out may require standings. the numbers add up. you may want to set someone + as well, heaven forbid.i freely admit this proposal is a bit selfish, the cva is nrds. imperial dreams administrates many outposts. for those unaware, you use corp standings for docking rights pricing and other factors. more slots would enable more considerations, more use of standings other than -10, 0 or +10. there is no loser by supporting this change.what does this cost nbsi groups or others who simply do not care? nothing! at worst you ignore the extra slots. at best perhaps you embark on your own standings experiments. this proposal does empower those groups who like to play at the politics, or manage territory or enrich the game with years long grudges to exercise more control. there are thousands of pilots in eve who stand to benefit from increased standing slots. i ask for your support at bringing this to ccp's attention. double, triple (or more!) the standings for a corperation."
"more slots are definitely needed.in the past it's been possible to use alliance standings once you run out of corporation ones, but with the advent of faction warfare that's not going to be possible for a lot of us."
"yes i support more standing slots"
"yes gimme moar."
"i'm guessing that there might be a 'need for speed' angle to this, in that each time someone enters local their corp/alliance needs to be checked against the standings table of your corp/alliance (and multiplied by the number of people in system) unless it is cached in some way to the 35,000 or so pilots in pod at any time. either way, there might be an issue with implementing it.saying that though, i can see nothing 'special' about 300 (it isn't a power of 2, for example, and doesn't have any good hash qualities) so a higher number is almost certainly technically feasible (511 at least?) and i would support this proposal. the 'game' has moved on from when the initial number of slots was set ...iz"
"you know, i had totally forgotten about the faction warfare aspects! if faction warfare is a success there will most certainly be a need for more slots. i know this does not seem like a hotbutton issue but it does have the fortune of being fairly simple and quick to discuss, hence it would not take much council time (i would think. anyway, please support!"
"please make it an option for us to opt out of the profanity filter. it's rather annoying to have to try and figure out what was said because someone's definition of profanity happens to be a standard part of a non-profane word."
"clearly, i support this issue"
"are you suggesting cracking the profanity filter? you should know that ccp's profanity filter is uncrackable! er...the funny thing about the profanity filter is that it's just a difference in how the text is rendered - you hit quote, and all the same \"****, ****, ****, ass, dildo, boner, *****, *****, butthole, barbara streisand!\" is still there. it's not like profanity filtration has ever been especially logical, but that's a really odd hole in it."
"edit; a configurable ingame swearing filter would nice, so that you could swear all you like in local and people could activate the word filter so that their virgin eyes are protected."
"a configurable, toggle-able profanity filter would be jolly good fun. ****, it's ****ing about ****ing time that we can say **** **** **** and not offend the seven <18 year olds that play eve.not that i have -ever- tempted the profanity filter here, or swore in-game. i'm innocent. o:d"
"this is a ****ing good idea."
"i'd also like to add that t2 ammo needs to be boosted so it's actually worth inventing as well."
"i support fixing the obvious lack of pg in nighthawk."
"if all he wants is +4 or +5 powergrid, can you tell me what percentage that is? or how many powergrid implants you would need to get +4 or +5 more powergrid out of the crane?it's not that they're the only blockade runners allowed to use implants, it's that he's completely ignoring the fact that ccp allows everyone a chance to bump the powergrid or cpu a few percent without losing any lows or rig slots. by the way, you can use lows or rigs."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"a 3% powergrid implant is sufficient to shoehorn on a basic fit.as i mentioned higher up, a pds ii, ancillary current router or micro auxiliary power core will too. but y'know, almost every ship out there, can fit the basics to do it's job, without needing fittings mods. we're not talking a full rack of top tier weaponry, a full tank and a cap injector here. (not that the crane doesn't have the same problem fitting a heavy missile launcher ii mind) we're talking mwd, 3 shield hardeners, and a cloak. not a hefty gank/tank/neut fit. the list of ships that cannot do that is really very short. it's barges, t1 haulers. but most importantly of all, it's very definitely _not_ the other blockade runners."
"he has said no to searching assets inside cans. i didn't even know you could search for remote assets.that seems very differnt to this proposal, which is to be able to open one or two remote cans. so i'm not so sure he has said no to this proposal."
"thanks for the alt post. also you might want to check a sov map, \"goons\" have far from a few systems."
"nope."
"plus 1!!!!"
"you really hate goons, huh? shame you fail to realise this isn't just about goons. it will effect goons, just as it will effect everyone else (if anything changes). maybe if you actually read the thread, you would see all the support from people in other space holding alliances...ha! who am i kidding? you're the alt of someone with a chip on your shoulder who has been following every thread that might be related to goons at all, being as negative and un-constructive as possible. at the same time you try to label us as disruptive. you're not fooling anyone. stop posting. if you don't want to have a reasonable discussion, don't stop us having one."
"disagree with the intent of this. a cyno jammer shouldn't in any way prevent the owning and friendly forces from deploying any assets into the system. so while letting capitals use the jump bridge may seem odd, it is at least a way to give some advantage to the defender."
"... intented mechanic... or accidental flaw... can't believe some of the issues posted, this one is also a jaw dropper... what a fair fight... not..."
"support + caps + pos vs support is a little too imba in favour of the defenders.if you want to get your friendly caps into the system, drop the jammer and provide a window of opportunity for the opposition to do the same. being able to pick that window is still enough of an advantage for the defenders."
"yes to every one of the ideas!"
"racial fonts to choose from? it's not like the standard font of the ui is really awesome...but totally supported."
"the amount of screen real-estate needed for an effective eve overview hud is, indeed, already overkill. i want to see the new (and very useful) icons made *visible* though and that means being able to position them on the ship line where the pilot chooses, not just as the right-hand end. personally, i feel that if they overlay *any* existing column they become messy, such that you can't clearly see either the ew attacking you or the information being masked by the ew icons, hence proposing that they are treated as a separate column.now *merging* some of the icon-only columns might work, though i could imagine that coding that and ensuring it was as fast to display to the pilot, might not be so effective.iz"
"we could theoretically get rid of the \"ship type\" column if they could somehow make the ship brackets reflect the types of ships better, although with the advent of t2 ships, a hac isn't a hac isn't a hac anymore, so i don't know.but, we currently have 4? ship brackets (frigate, cruiser, battleship, industrial), and yet many more ship \"classes\"... stealth, interception, ew and tackling, logistics, dps hulls, hacs, interdictors, the various capitals with their purposes... more brackets would be good. maybe if they add enough brackets, and code them well, we could get rid of the ship type column altogether. dunno."
"agreed"
"we've been promised this is something that is coming soon."
"my problem with these is the same as other posters have said, in that they're waaay too gimped in the damage department, especially the prometheus. the ishtar is the closest thing to a ratting machine the gallente have, and this stands the greatest chance of being something similar. i'd like to see the slots as something similar to the ishtar, with 3 turret points, 5 total highs (prober and tractor/salvager in the non turrets), and a full 5 heavy drones deployed. so, my ideal would be 5/4/7 layout, with same drone bay, and 125mb/s bandwidth. yes, this means it's viable in pvp. about time we get a drone boat bigger than the ishtar. but that's only peripheral to it actually working for its designed purpose of being able to solo small exploration sites.(and i think the example of an explorer someone was looking for was like indiana jones, not columbus.)"
"i could see the caldari being left 25/25 on drone bay but at least let the other guys get 25/50 or something for a spare drone.i love caldari and drones. it leads to a terrible double life :("
"the enterprise mission had a 7 years duration.on a historical level you are paragoning eve exploration to sea exploration (mostly). a lot of that was done with single ships with a crew of some hundred, so similar to eve pod cruiser, but eve exploration is more similar to the gold prospector or trappers expeditions, we are not there to cart new route or explore new unknow systems, we are there to find and plunder whatever riches there are in already partially know locations the fast way. then, if we find some resource that can be exploited in a constant form we return with a larger force to do that. so we need soemthing that can plunder the exploration location reasonably fast if it is possible to solo them or capable of returning home fast to get a small fleet more appropratie for the reource found."
"i'd like to see this happen."
"i'd like some opinions on this please.when looking over the different ships in all available classes you can come to a quick conclusion concerning faction ships. they are only in tech 1 classes and there are only 3 different classes of them.--------------- empires - outlaw- frigates ---- 5 ------- 5- cruisers ---- 5 ------- 5- battleships - 5 ------- 51 of each for each faction. not counting special faction ships, but only those readily available through the lp store. also not looking at posses.when i look then at the list of tech 1 classes i can see there are more then 3 only.- destroyers- battlecruisers- industrialsthere for, i would love to see faction version of those 3 classes for all factions, both empire and outlaw. it would in essence in one go double the amount of faction ships available in the game.this would be a good thing, because you'd have something in between the dirty cheap frigate, okish cruiser and insanely expensive battleship. because it'd add abit of extra flavour to all factions. because it would double the amount of outlaw faction ships. because you can get a special hauler then. opinions please?edit: 1 extra faction cruiser for all empire factions as mentioned"
"two things. one, empyrean is adding a few new faction ships - navy versions of the omen, exqueror, osprey, and scythe, if i'm not mistaken. no pirate-faction ships, though. two, i'm not adverse to this per se, but some things need to be established. first up, faction industrials are pretty pointless, unless that's how you want to implement the mini-freighter class, and i don't think it is(since the goal there is smaller freighters, not bigger haulers - action in space is inappropriate for them). secondly, i don't think the destroyer class has much of a role, certainly not enough to justify factionalization. third, whichever way you went on battlecruisers would **** off somebody - the caldari and gallente especially have two wholly different bc's, and you'd anger one half of the split or the other no matter which one you decided to implement. also, create some pirate faction ships that aren't just the same old all the time - three of a kind if ine, but we don't want all of them to just be identical. i'm not really sure that more faction ships are needed at all, but those are some things that should be watched for if you do."
"what i would like is for the factional ships to be reduced in price. not too much of a discount, but enough so that they are still viable to use in pvp combat.t1 frigate 500kt2 frigate 10mtf frigate 40mat least thats how it was a year or so ago when i got my amarr navy slicer. we cannot change the base cost of these ships, but we can reduce the lp and isk cost of the blueprint somewhat. maybe an empire faction frigate costing 15-20m total, and a pirate faction one 20-25m [due to the extra bonus]?also, while i would love to see faction destroyers [mmmm, lasery lasery coercer], with the current cost scheme they would cost about 80m. and wouldn't be that much more powerful than their current incarnation.faction battlecruisers? probably around 500m. while you can't say 'that faction frigate costs 40m? you may as well get a cruiser' the same can't be said for the half-ranked ships. destroyer and battlecruiser faction ships would easily be outshone by their larger brethren, in cost effectiveness at least.as for faction industrials, i don't see the amarr navy having their own haulers, though adding in logistical faction ships would be quite nifty.each of the navies has a logistic branch and an industry branch, so you could use those. logistic one uses the t1 support cruiser hull for their first ship, and the industry one can give a faction hauler."
"it would be pretty tricky to implement something faction like i agree.i'm not going to put it any way other then it is, i like shiny toys. even if those shiny toys aren't all that useful or cost effective. like a faction industrial probably would be.the cost of faction ships is, for me at least, a minor issue. there are only so few of them, particularly if your desire is to fly an outlaw faction's ships."
"the optimist in me hopes that at least some of these will be sorted out with the empyrean age expansion.however, the realist in me knows that we've had dozens of false dawns and broken promises in the past and i have a nasty feeling that ccp will be sitting on these once again.for those of you who aren't aware of what i'm talking about, eve has a wonderfully detailed back-story, but a lot of ccp's production values relating to that back story leave a lot to be desired.here are some examples:in 2003, after a wonderful frigate tournament and associated events, the unsuccessful amarrian heirs all committed suicide. four out of the five were replaced. four and a half years later, house sarum still does not have an heir. of the four heirs we do have, only three have a biography on this page. why no biography for the ardishapur heir?the timeline mentions that the current emperor was selected in 22762ad. this was accurate back in 2003, but given that both that emperor and his successor have died since then, it's now a little out of date.that same entry suggests that it was the selection heideran vii that precipitated the khanid seccession. however, this chronicle contradicts this, saying that khanid rebelled against heideran vii's predecessor. then was have the wonderful year 105 overview. this was a great idea and a boon to eve historians everywhere. but where are the overviews for years 106, 107, 108 and 109?and don't get me started with the kind of confusion amongst players that the introduction of the khanid bloodline caused. please, don't get me started.and last but most certainly not least, we have that story arc. the assassination of emperor doriam ii. we're still waiting to hear for some news about the hunt for his killer nearly three years later. we still don't know what's happening amongst the empire's leadership. is having a major faction without a head of state for three years without explanation really conducive to having an immersive back-story? long-term readers of my rants on this subject may recall ginger announcing in december 2006 that there would definitely be some sort of progress on the amarr leadership arc in 2007 and that the story-arc around it would \"really rock\". well, here we are half-way through 2008 and no sign of any rocks except for what i'd like to throw at ginger. you'll notice that these problems all relate to the amarr. there are issues relating to the other faction's back-stories too, but there's not enough room to describe them all! there are also countless unfinished smaller event arcs from way back that were never finished.therefore, i would like the csm to put pressure on ccp to produce the kind of consistent and dynamic background that this game deserves, to clear up the contradictions in the back-story, and to make every effort to resolve the many unfinished story-arcs as soon as possible."

"i have read about a number of other price capping items being in place. i can't say i have a list of them off hand, but i know that they do exist.aside from the price caps, what do you think about the idea of a dynamic market?it was pointed out earlier that implemnting it the way i explained had the oppertunity for somone who had control of an entire regional market to take advantage of it and use that control to tip the markets unfairly. so, maybe my idea of completely regional based prices is not an idea solution. i had actually thought of this ahead of time but didn't want to detail all my ideas as i wanted there to be some room for others to think about it. solveing this particular problem might be accomplished by only weighing the region's price of end good based on local prices, but the root be based off of eve wide price averages.that being said, i like the ability to create a situation where one region could be underpriced and another be overpriced. this would encourage inter-region trade.btw, i love your corp name herschel."

"these are all one issue? i count 60+ issues here! they all are in the science and industry scope, but thats are far as the connection goes...are you seriously suggesting that it is alright to bundle a heap of issues together under one tenious connection, such as pos warfare/pirate ganking/aggro timers/killrights/black ops because they all fall under the scope of pvp?they need to be seperated so we can discuss the pros and cons of each one and inform the csm reps of the arguments, especially as only a few of them have industry/science leanings of any degree. take care,arithron"
"items that appear to be fine as listed: public production and science ability to contract shares the ability to bid on auctions in different region increased dividend amountthe others need further development. these two i think are in the most need of further discussion.out of your list, this item stikes me as being an odd one out.i fail to see how this would take market pvp to the next level.with combat pvp the objective is simple: kill the other guy before he kills you.with market pvp the objective is also simple: offer the best price in that location.if you remove that victory condition, what is the new victory condition for market pvp?what exactly do you suggest that we do about it? what would vary between different raven's? having lots of otherwise identical products on the market would not improve the market. what would drive demand for these superfisial variations? you can already sell customized raven's (ie with rigs) via contracts, but there seems to be comparitively little demand in contrast with the standardized raven. for a most wanted feature, this one is poorly defined."

"the current mac version of the client is horrible. suffers from much lower framerates, graphical glitches, and instability compared with the win client. there's also the fact that we're stuck with the non-premium graphics for the foreseeable future. i'm paying the same amount in sub fees as the win players, yet getting a vastly inferior gaming experience.i understand there are major technological issues that need to be overcome, but it seems that the open source community is solving these at a faster rate than transgaming. this needs to be looked into and it would be nice to get some communication from ccp on this issue."
"i am just a couple skills away from flying one, but haven't gotten them because they seem to be not worth it. they need their combat abilities and jump abilities increased. some other way than mentioned by the op might also work (jump into jammed systems + greater damage rather than increased range + covops cloak possible)."

"i think the highest vote getter should be the acting chairman, until after the first couple of meetings, at which point an internal vote could decide."
"the roll of chairman is to facilitate discussion and other such administrative duties. he is not some sort of dictator with power over the masses.as such i fully support this amendment.the council should decide, based on the social dynamics of the group, who among them will best moderate discussion.just because someone was the most popular at the polls does not mean they are the most effective at administration."
"i don't agree.the person with the most votes is who the voters want to be the head.so there should not be some sort of bypass on this.the person with the most votes should be the head of the csm. if the person with the most votes doesn't want to be the chairman, he should be able to step down and a new election started. to see who gets the most votes this time.however, if this person doesn't do his work. there should be a way to make a vote of no-trust."
"i think you are spot on...chairman is the chairman unless they step down (council then elects a replacement) or they are unable to do the job, at which time they can be removed from the post by a super majority vote of the remaining members (6 or 7 of 8)by the same token, with a super majority vote (and ccp approval) council members should be able to be removed and replaced by the alternates.in both cases, the votes should be public and require posts explaining why the vote was taken and the voting members need to explain their votes in that thread... open government..."

"it has nothing to do with \"me\" being happy. i am just looking at this from a distance comparing whats out there. especially if this is supposed to be balanced for the player base in general.that's fine about the lo-sec issue but how does that effect 0.0? if you change the effect of the falcon because of the lo-sec issues, how does that impact the other part of the player base in 0.0? is it a good thing or bad? you and capt. blanko seemed to get on your respective ears about it, and i am not sure why. i am just bringing out a point for discussion. what makes these \"issue\" threads useless is when we have multiple players with a single minded focus and the unwillingness to compromise."
"falcon is as it should be.if anything the rook should be buffed as there is no reason to use them over a falcon these days. maybe give it the firepower of a cerb to bring it into line with the hugin having alot more dps than a rapier."
"while i agree the rook needs a small buff to give it a purpose that isn't already done by the falcon, give it too much missile firepower would make it not worth flying a cerberus. right now a rook with 5 hml ii's and no damage mods does ~120-150dps, i can see that being upped would be nice, but not too much."
"wtf, if you fit it anyway else, you might aswell bring another kind of ship.all other recons don't get primaried every single time they appear on the battlefield.if you want to nerf the falcon in lowsec, please come up with a way that does not make it totally useless in 0.0.until that day, don't you dare touch it."
"ah, i did."
"i fly a rapier and when we run into nano gangs im pretty much primary. its not easy staying alive in those fights, pretty darn hard tbh, and sometimes its impossible to make it out alive.still i don't use the argument that the rapier should have 200km range because i cant fit a tank because i need 6 webifiers to stay alive.\"falcons cant have a tank because they need full rack of ecm because they cant fit a tank... etc\". i think this is circular argument and it does not validate its need for extreme range.i understand that the falcon might not be the fastest and most agile ship. but it shouldn't be a impossible task to fix it so it would be able to operate within 100km range as the rest of the recons.the arguments you are using for the 200km range sounds to me like our falcons is so dangerous for the opposing gang that they will instantly primary it, therefore we must be allowed to move it out of the combat area. i would have understood it if you said you needed it for sniper fleets, but then again wouldn't a rook do that job just as good?"
"there is one difference, with your rapier you remove a ships defensive capabilities (at least in case of a nano ship) and help get it killed quickly. a falcon only removes a ships offensive capabilities, so if the falcon pilot dies early, it hasn't done a whole lot of good. ecm ships are pretty much all-or-nothing, they may be overpowered if they work, but if they don't they are just useless.i don't need a range of 200km as that's not the way i would fly it, but this is also not its natural range. i am just afraid that if you gimp its range too much (it's already limited in locking range compared to a rook), you would make range rigs and sensor boosters almost essential to stay at a reasonable range (~100km with a buffer of 50km or so). i probably wouldn't mind a reduction of the ecm range bonus to 15% or even 10%, if the jamming strength stays as is.with regards to fleet warfare, it might be arguable that it wouldn't be harmful if the falcon would be the ecm recon of choice for small gangs and the rook the ecm recon of choice for fleets."
"disagree re: falcon overpowered.op forgot additional solution....damps.they work. the falcon parked at 150km+ won't be jamming much with a pair of damps from virtually any ship capable of targetting to that range.you just need to lock them first .a script of some sort would not be out of line."
"i do not agree with falcons being overpowered.cva faces falcons on a regular basis and there are several good counters1) sniping apocs with eccm - can hit out to 230km and kill jamming falcons very quickly2) eccm generally significantly reduces falcons effectiveness3) a good nano-ship can reach a falcon at 200km in under 30 seconds. the falcon then has a choice run and warp back in (if he has another prepared sniper spot) or try and keep the nano permajammed. in most cases the falcon will run or die...there really is no need to nerf falcons..."
"rsd with max skills: optimal 45km falloff: 90kmwith 2 sensor boosters, 1 rsd and 3 particle dispersion rigs on a bs you have 50% chance of dampening a falcon at 161km. if it stays out at 200km youll have around 25% chanse. thats when you have used all 3 rigslots and 3 medslots. id rather fly my vaga then,,"
"nice to see a response from a csm member,, although im a bit surprised you didnt take the time to read the thread before you replied."
"as useless as the arazu's are, wouldn't that be a better counter than having you bs's fit rsd's? i mean if you are going to actually take the time to reconfig all your bs's, would it not make more sense in asking for a celestes,arazu or a keres even in your support group? think about the gang you are going to put together. obviously the gang with the falcon thought about it."
"there is no ship with a rsd range bonus, so they will all have the same chance for dampening the falcon,, the t2 ships will actually be even worse since they can only fit 2 rigs.i dont have any problems with composing gangs, and thats not the issue either."
"i read the thread but do not agree with you that the counters are useless. probably shouldn't have bothered repeating them though - which is due to me reading the thread in the morning and then replying to it in the afternoon and focusing on some of the responses rather than the original post. sorry!despite that my view stands. i do not think falcons are overpowered...edit: i would just like to add that i do accept that falcons can tip the balance if employed properly against unprepared opponents and they are certainly being used much more frequently than before - but they are by no means a 'win' button."
"i'm personally happy with where falcons are. the other recons need to be significantly boosted.however ccp=nerf. so thusly falcons need scripts. either you get a strong strength and a short jam length. or weak strength and long jam length.easily fixed."
"read a bunch of points; most of them absolute rubbish.rook for fleet; for reasons that if you can't figure out then you don't know how to fit for fleet.falcon for gang; for all the obvious reasons.i can see how the falcon could be more of an issue in low-sec, demanding you bring counters with you - but it's no different than having to bring rapiers/huginns or neut/rr bs to stop nano.in the end this is nothing more than a 'i don't like having to bring a counter to x' thread.disclaimer: this point of view brought to you by 0.0; big gang influence may be present. falcon is perfectly balanced for 0.0."
"tell that to huginn and rapier pilots, they have to get to 30-40km to do their job. same went for the arazu before it sucked. the curse doesn't exactly find itself at the bottom of the list when it comes to priority targets either.get real. while i am against a falcon nerf, your statement is ignorant and speaks to a lack of experience."
"any sniper works nicely, but it's not an option in low-sec, which was the problem described above. the problem here is that falcons do not scale downwards. they work nicely in 0.0 fleets and have the appropriate effects, but they get more and more powerful the smaller the fleet becomes. especially the falcon at 200km is almost impossible to deal with for small fleets: they can not bring a sniper bs, because that would lower their dps by a good third, usually.fitting eccm works nicely, if you have mid slots to spare. it reduces the jam chance by (a bit below) 50%. if all ships in your fleet fit eccm, a falcon will be able to only jam 1 ship more or less permanently, possibly a second one at times, instead of 2-3, and you have reduced the effectiveness of your ships against the other opponents. but yes, eccm is a good counter to falcons.we recently had an engagement in low-sec, 2x bs, 1x bc on our side vs. 1x bs, 1x hac, 1x falcon on the other; we got the bs because both of our bs were tempests with 2x best named eccm in the mids. we had to bump the enemy bs to keep it from warping, because at one point, we were both jammed.the normal, non-inty nano ships i fly with reach speeds of 4-5km/s, pushing this more to 45-55 seconds. in engagements with 2-3 bs on each side, you usually have already lost 33% of your dps (one bs) by that time. and the falcon can still jam the incoming nano ship and warp off, leaving you with no falcon kill, and a whole bs kill to catch up. and your nano ship at this point has done nothing but to scare off a falcon. on the other hand, the falcon has caused you to lose a bs without much you could have done, and taken out a nano cruiser of the main engagement.i still think the falcon needs some balancing. not to be made useless, not to reduce his jam efficiency, or anything like that. there have been nice ideas in this thread that keep the effectiveness of falcons for 0.0 fleet fights intact just as it is right now, but balances the small gang / low-sec combat."
"yeah,, good point. although falcons is very good for breaking up spider tanks.in my experience this seems to be the new standar range (180-200km)."
"its not really a new standard. it is flown normally at this range. the ones that don't or feel its not natural will fit multi-specs instead of racials. actually you can squeeze out 20 or 30km more optimal if you focus your skills.if you specialize and with good skills, t1 rigs, and racials you can target out to about 240km with 0ne sbii with target range script, about a 250 scan res, 228+41km range on your racials. 152+27 with multi specs.that might be why yuki sees that 200+km in not natural for the falcon, because she might be flying with multi-specs."
"bad wording perhaps, i merely meant the range of a falcon without range rigs and mods. personally i don't need more range than the standard 150km at the moment because i rarely camp, but if this range would be drastically reduced, i would pretty much have to fit for range, too (not complaining, just saying)."
"wait, so it shouldn't be a job but it should be?"
"wouldn't that require a huge amount of work, coding, and scripting that could be better-used elsewhere? it's essentially writing an entirely new, from-scratch sovereignty system. there are many more thought-out proposals that could use this sort of attention right now."
"ccp is already looking into changing the sovereignty system and devoting resources to doing so - it's simply in the playerbase's best interest to get the csm asking questions about how that is progressing and finding out what impact our thoughts and ideas can have on it."
"look at the mechanics in 0.0 yes. considering them in the method suggested by this proposal? no.i will touch on point 2 and 3 raised.2) allows small gangs methods to impact sov warfare in a meaningful way. i love small gang fighting, i really do, but the specifics proposed will not correct the problem. whatever your small gangs can do my big gangs can do better. even if you concentrate your forces on the minimum number of points needed to take an objective your opponent needs only focus on one or two that you attack and destroy you, problem solved. i see a great deal of pointless chasing back and forth, cloaking and waiting for the right afk moment etc. in other words, not actual fighting. the fact is you can wear down alliances with fading tactics without changing a thing.3)remove tower logistics from sov warfare. sorry, attacking logistics should be viable. while i can agree that tower logistics should be streamlined as to make them less of an absolute burden they should remain important to the sov system. it is a weakness that your opponent can exploit.groups that have been willing to sustain a long and determined presence in enemy territory can get results. we have seen it. the tactic may not be as effective against various entities but it is viable. creating artificial victory conditions will only add unwanted dimensions to the game. players logging in at 35 minutes till downtime swarming gates to flip sov or knock modules in system offline because these victory points cannot be defended 24/7 will not improve the situation or somehow make small gangs magically superior.this system actually decreases the risk of attacking forces and increases the risk of holding forces. either hit the logistics hampering the enemy (this proposal wants to remove the sov/logistics link) put up the forces needed to get the job done (this proposal creates new artificial goals that can be effectively sniped by fewer people which would give even larger groups greater power) or maintain the battlefield presence and wear down your foes. most of us do not labor under the illusion sov war should be easy and it does need corrections but under no circumstances should we be narrowing down the choices to ping pong and first person shooter like beacon holding.hopefully we can convince the representatives that this specific suggestion should not be considered by ccp.no support!"
"let me point out that the example proposal is just that - an example. the topic at issue here is whether the csm should get involved in ccp's re-examination of sovereignty."
"i confess that i don't know a whole lot about sovereignty and the dynamics of pos warfare myself, but i do hear a lot that the current mega-alliances holding sovereignty over much of 0.0 have used the existing pos-based sovereignty framework to create very high entry barriers to new alliances attempting to cut themselves a slice of territory. it seems reasonable to reexamine it.i like the idea of having to maintain a player presence in claimed territory to maintain the claim, which will promote more efficient use of 0.0 territory by pilots by increasing the number of alliances with territory and shrinking those territories to more practical and defensible sizes. naturally, mega-alliances have a strong interest in maintaining the status quo, so i hardly expect them to rally behind this idea."
"way overdue for revamping"
"ah yes! another post in the csm section about re-shaping eve to meet star fraction's playstyle. next <issue> \"making nano ships faster and cloaking more effective-improving eve for the little guy\".interestingly enough in the two csm agenda = star fraction threads ive read so far-the goonswarm has had the most rational and reasonable posts. there is no question that sov could use some improvement (much like 0.0 could enjoy some more dynamism) however the jade fraction agenda is so remarkably self serving its rather shocking that it is permitted to continue unchecked. i do truly hope folks will continue to realize that jade's role as chairman of the csm should not = jade's role as head of the star fraction alliance and its specific playstyle.this would be like watching the goonie members championing more blob tactics, more super alliance play stayles in every suggestion. or perhaps the bob member posting about how under powered titans are. or watching hardin posting thread after thread about improving roleplay. you folks were elected to represent all of eve-not pet projects, not pet play styles."
"one thing i'd like a re-examination of sovereignty to address would be guarding against the kind of current scenario we have where an alliance \"owns\" a large area of space, but it's generally very empty of players and the \"ownership\" is not reflected in terms of player presence.this would be rectified by devising a system where player ship presence and activity is more closely linked to the ownership mechanic - so that areas of space that are generally very empty are unowned, but more populated areas are more likely to be under the control of those who populate them."
"actually no, this proposal wants sov looked at in very specific contexts. while sov should be examined i cannot support that context or agenda or the examples cited, as such i cannot support this issue.i hope enough reps can see the downside and not support this either."
"i'll point out that ccp representatives are already on record as pursuing alternative sovereignty mechanics. there is a sticky in the features and ideas about it. i think it would be foolish to want to stick our heads in the sand and not get involved in what the outcome of that pursuit is. but yes, the topic does involve certain contexts - although they are broad and commonly agreed upon."
"if this is true then there is no reason whatsoever for this issue to be brought up. if they are already working on it-what do we expect to contribute to the discussion? or are you asking for specific support for your very specific approach to the problem? in a differnt thread jade-our esteemed chairman and your boss, is trying to force a bad idea into the csm agenda by saying \"whats wrong with at least bringing it up\". assuming that is the point of jade's leadership-to surface ideas that ccp might be overlooking. i see no reason for this item to be on the agenda. as you dutifully and acurately point out -ccp is already aware and working on the problem."
"i think you're in a small minority if you aren't interested in knowing how ccp is going to handle a revamp of sovereignty and having some input in the process."
"the purpose of the csm is to bring to the ears of ccp what the player base wants them to hear and adress.if they have already heard and are adressing the issue then why exactly do they need to be told what they already know?"
"yes please."
"as it is now, it's up to the application to grab what it needs from the database. good luck getting ccp to budge."
"agree with op on this"
"this is a good idea"
"definitely would be nice, though i can imagine it could be obnoxious to patch onto the current system."
"it is ironic but then i've never found riethe to be stupid in any way. good idea from an always bright, if twisted, individual."
"this should be the top priority for the api development.definitely supporting this."
"i like this idea."
"advertisement at log-in is a good idea. mandatory voting is a bad one."
"i did not vote, specifically because \"abstain\" meant \"i just don't see a good candidate,\" whereas not voting (and that 26,000 number) was a message that i didn't care about the whole csm thing in general.i think that they can put a lot of effort into advertising the csm and making sure we're aware of it, and then the numbers are gonna come back to them to prove that it wasn't that we didn't know, but that we didn't care, after all.do you like windows vista, by the way?"
"i didn't vote as i didn't want a csm. if i was forced to vote or i couldn't log in i'd either not log in till the voting was over and then log back in, or if ccp were stupid enough not to let you log in ever again if you didn;t vote, then i'd be forced to quit eve and i don't want that.fortunately, for the most part, ccp are not stupid."
"this.additionally you could have concord spam mailboxes in game once 7 days before voting to inform everyone and once when the voting starts."
"some how i hope that csm have better things to do then to figure out ways to hassle the people that play the game that they are electedpopups are one of the most annoying things the internet has ever thought up,they are considered to be adware,spyware and even incases viruses i would think eve would have more sense then to try that tactic maybe the voting turn out was because people put little faith in anything ccp trys most thier ideas are half baked like 60 day gtc for instance while doing away with 30 and 90 days.new expansions and updates while the game they have has all kinds of problem such as lag everytime you try to have a decent fleet battle,fix the game then i will consider the trivial stuff like voting for a csm"
"in-game voting from the character sheet or the character selection screen = winnagging and being annoying = bad"
"i'm all for more people voting and getting involved etc., but you can't force people to vote. deliberately abstaining is a perfectly legitimate thing to choose.the best way to get players involved is for them to see the difference that csm makes. make a difference in the quality of the players' experience and players will get involved when they see that this stuff matters.so, kind of supporting the principle, but i'm afraid no support for this proposal. sorry jade!"
"forcing people to vote is a no-go."
"i'd like to see more people vote, yes. i would not like to see more people vote because they clicked a button, portrait, name, etc., just to get into the game.let democracy promote itself. if it can convince the playerbase that its important, problem solved. i can not support 'forced' democracy though. even typing it sounds wrong."
"i think that this is a game, as such it has limitations. we have all faced lag, we have all had things not work properly. yet sometimes they get reimbursed, and sometimes they don't. there should be a flat no response to all requests for reimbursement that is caused by bugs or technical issues or lag. you shouldn't fly something that you can't afford to lose. the only time that reimbursement should be allowed is if someone's account got hacked or something like that."
"disagree. it works fine as-is - players shouldn't be punished for technical failures on ccp's part."
"i agree. the reimbursement system rewards those who abuse it. a flat \"no\" response would be better, everybody would know what they're entitled to (i.e., nothing) and there'd be no more whining and crying based on the \"squeaky wheel gets a free raven\" principle."
"having lost more than one ship to a bug, glitch, or known technical problem, and almost lost quite a few more to severe random lag, i can't support this. if it's ccp's fault, they should replace it, especially if it's a known and unavoidable bug that they can't fix."
"not only am i in favor of compensation for players who they lose their ship when it's ccp's fault, i am against people giving out their password or downloading keyloggers and then complaining that they were hacked and demanding recompense."
"agreed. i lost a couple of hundred mill in a fight after a gate crashed my system, couldnt log back on, petitioned it, logged back on found myself at a gate with 4 reds, the gate wouldnt work even though i got to it and didnt aggro, non of my mods would turn on and i generally got sc****d. several others in the area were suffering lag and problems in the surrounding systems even tho there were few people in them. i petitioned got turned down because \"the log showed no problems\" and that was that. i didnt worry too much but then i hear about others being reimbursed for cap ships etc and it is crap.and it wasnt my system either, i run a far more powerful pc than eve needs.so agreed, if everyone gets the same treatment, no one can complain too hard. like the man said if you cant afford to lose it, dont take it into space. everyone knows about lag and what it can do to your ships so everyone is on the same page."
"disagree on this account. if you lose an asset due to a bug in the software, it should be reimbursed fully."
"i would think the words after \"[issue]\" would key you into the importance, as well as how many people responded to the post. no i just want this form a bit more readable maybe, but as is the thread name usually is a pretty good indicator of what the issue is. and discussion, well what is discussed? an issue, balancing/tweaking, again an issue. it is all just rather redundant in my mind."
"how bout not letting irrelevant and lame threads like this on the forums?"
"there should be a list of known exploits that have been acknowledged by ccp. i know that i have been a victim and an unintentional exploiter in the past on various accounts. having a list of exploits, as well as their effects (so we can see if we have been a victim of them) should be listed as soon as they are acknowledged. the method to reproduce them should be listed as soon as they are fixed, so that when the next code branch comes out and the exploit is reintroduced because it wasn't patched to other code branches, they will be caught and reported earlier by the playerbase, instead of merely being exploited again by the same people who found the exploit to begin with."
"i support this one too"
"i disagree - publishing full details of previous exploits can often give people the understanding of your internal structures, potentially your db schema and any other sort of information that can be gleaned from reading-between-the-lines. this just opens the doors to all sorts of trouble"
"the people that are finding the exploits to begin with don't seem to have any trouble finding them without that knowledge. the more knowledge that is out there, the more secure things will become as a result."
"/signed, because security by obscurity causes more security problems than it hides."
"in one aspect this is the \"open source is good\" argument, in that by knowing what went wrong you can ensure it shouldn't go wrong again the same way. thing is eve is proprietary and to make too much detail available would be more likely to make \"other ne'er-do-wells\" search for things they could take advantage of.i don't, therefore, feel that this is a sensible idea, however making available additional information about an exploit which has been closed so that you don't accidentally appear to be trying that style of exploit in the future could, in some circumstances, be beneficial to 'normal' pilots. maybe.iz"
"i also disagree.not all exploits that ccp discoveres are found by players.there were some exploits that never been used, but were fixed anyway (before someone would find out).giving information over these unfound exploits is not smart."
"this.everyone will go 'oh look exploits! i never knew that one. brb, exploiting'"
"there has been all this hot are floating around about bacon and other similar applications which augment local. so why aren't we all up in arms about micro miner bots. i'm sure it is not beyond the abilities of ccp to acquire these programs, analyse them and implement appropriate counter measures.i'd real like a fix where they are flagged as macro-miners and everyone can shoot them freely to add the the games enjoyment for the rest."
"problem is, these macros don't require any communication to the server. they are client-side scripts. ccp can analyze them all they want and it wont allow them to detect someone using one."
"can someone explain what the problem is that you're trying to solve?"
"well the \"flagging them part\" was a nice to have joke. but it might be possible to analyse how these macro's work and prevent them doing so. never having used one i don't know what they do and can not therefore really suggest solutions but i'm guessing 0.0 ones detect hostiles and take appropriate actions. they will need to target new asteriods presumeable they use the overview to do this. now if it's possible to prevent applications exploiting the information in local i would assume the same is true of overview. yes i know they can sort overview select in squence, use scanner do the same, point is it must surely be worth investing time and effort into dealing with this problem.mara rinn - there are people who use macro's to running mining ships on eve. these people are also often the isk sellers. it is a breach of the eula but also to the detriment of all other players as it impacts the ores/mineral markets, flooding the game with isk effectively leading to devaluation. eve is market based so this sort of activity is very damaging."
"no, you can only make it harder (to the point of being impossible, if it requires too much \"intelligence\" for a bot). bacon does not hack into the client, but simply analyses information that is stored in plain text as a log. a macro is far more involved than this (and not allowed).this issue is very similar to the issue of aimbots in first person shooters, because you can only make it harder, but you can't make it impossible for a bot to analyse the information (even if it's just graphical) that is presented to the player and then act upon it like a player would by sending input. the more predictable the required actions are, the easier it is to create bots or macros."
"personally i love macro bots23/7 miner = more oresmore ores = cheaper orescheaper ores = cheaper stuff for meif macro bots are ruining your income, try mission running, it's basically mining (lock on to something, press f1-f8, get money)"
"so you are openly saying that people should brake the eula so that you can get cheap stuff?"
"your lack of appreciation of market economics is only exceeded by your ignorance of the eula.more ore = less income for real minersmore ore = keeper build cost for module = less income for mission runnersmore ore = more isk being traded for cash = bad"
"accidential alt post."
"yes, and don't support this thread."
"working as intended, no change necessary.the only think i'd like to see if a rack 5 skill and maybe some new more advanced stat skills, though again this is not necessary"
"what a lonely thread, i will support you little guy"
"learning skills are a pain, and yes we all know it. but if ccp defaulted and gave every1 the same skills it would just turn into a numb slugfest. my character is a direct result of my choices of specialization and it gives depth to that character. though a speed bump in training would be nice..."
"i know its nitpicking but i think its \"per se\"."
"i agree that +60 issue threads would be a bit much, however, there must be a balance that can be found.i agree with the settiment that you have bundled too much into a single proposal. it makes it far too diffucult to address each sub-proposal.most of your ideas i support, but it is diffucult to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the individual ideas with them so tightly bundled.perhaps breaking them down a bit more: ie improvements to shares, improvements to pos services, improvements to the market, improvements to contracts.there is simply too much in there, and the only constant uniting it all is that it does not involve combat mechanics.to the point, contrast the level of discussion in your thread, verse this more specific thread. while both touch on the need to improve share trading, your thread says very little about how that is accomplished and why that approach is favorable. the other thread allows the idea to be developed more fully.there are pros and cons to most of your suggestions. however, by uniting them all into a monstrous package, it limits and diffuses discussion of those specifics.i would encourage the council to replace lavista's general issue with discussion of the stock-market specifics for this meeting as we have atleast three threads (those linked above plus this one) that have been active for over a week discussing different approaches to implementing/improving this area of the game. then allow development of discussion on the other areas of lavista's proposals seperately before being them up in the council."
"per se is indeed correct!i agree with the idea of the shares being an agenda item and the rerst put up on seperate threads for better discussion.as an aside, i note that the meeting this weekend, 8th june, is within the 14 day period before the meeting in iceland. does this mean that the agenda items discussed, which have to be submitted to ccp at least 14 days in advance, won't be addressed by ccp this time?take care,arithron"
"as of this moment zero issues have been formally transmitted to ccp in the format of a submission template. time constraints have been harsh, and we are doing our best to invent this process from the ground up. all parties are going to need to appreciate that the csm document (full and summary) will be incomplete and inappropriate to the needs of the inaugural/founding session in certain aspects. we will be forwarding submission templates to ccp in advance of the iceland meeting but these will fall short of the 14 day specification in the documentation and we're going to be asking ccp for their understanding and forbearance on the issue in the interests of making this inaugural session work.as an aside, i'm going to ask people to stop trying to play legal games with the founding csm documentation for the apparent purpose of confusing the issues and making the task of the csm harder than it should be. we will get these things resolved and will have the csm documentation re-written where it needs to be revised and corrected. we are not going to slavishly adhere to the text where it needs revision and external input to ensure the csm can be all it can be for the game of eve and the community. for this inaugural session its my intention that we take 3 weeks worth of issues produced in template format and provide these to ccp 5-6 days in advance of the first csm/ccp meetings. yes this is certainly shorter than the 14 days specified but its my judgment call as csm chair that this represents better value to the community than simply flying to iceland with a grand total of zero issues added to the agenda after complying with the 7 day open discussion and 14 day prior submission rules in the documentation.sometimes you have to bend the rules to get a decent outcome. this is one of those times."
"the following three topics will have completed seven days of 'the ability for discussion' by the date of the meeting:* proposals for ui improvements* replace double-click in a chat channel* cargo hold size of ships in hangar but not in usenot surprisingly, for topics which will benefit everyone and are non-contentious, there are not an enormous number of responces, however they are all positive. eg.iz"
"as an aside, i'm going to ask people to stop trying to play legal games with the founding csm documentation for the apparent purpose of confusing the issues and making the task of the csm harder than it should be. we will get these things resolved and will have the csm documentation re-written where it needs to be revised and corrected. we aren't playing legal games, these are the clearly stated rules in the csm document, put up before the elections, which we all were well aware of. no items on the agenda for ccp before flying to iceland would be a failure of the current csm council, rather than a failure of the rules. nothing needs changing- you just have to make sure that meetings etc are held in the proper timeframe before the 14 day period, and issues are properly discussed and voted upon. highlighting the rules and framework that the csm works within doesn't confuse issues, it just draws your attention to something that you have to take into consideration and acknowledge. afterall, you can still bring the meeting forward to friday evening and get the agenda items submitted in time. by being aware of the requirements, you can avoid situations where you then need leeway etc.there actually isn't much wrong with the documentation that the csm has to work within. bypassing clearly laid-out criteria (eg, lavista's 60+ issues into a single vote) or overlooking clearly stated rules (eg, agenda items to ccp 14 days beforehand) don't require changes to any process...they require a little more care in the application to the process.if you follow this link (which, btw, is fantastic serenity!) you can clearly see nine issues you can present to ccp and discuss, as you have already voted on them in meetings."
"we (meaning csm+ccp) are altering the rules this time arithron. i've told you the rationale. and i'm confident that eve-players will understand the intention to get more useful issues on the agenda for iceland rather than less of them. you are free to disagree but this decision is made."
"adding them now inanna, thank you."
"i'm sorry, but we didn't overlook anything. that must be you.if you read the chat logs from the first council meeting, you will see this:[ 2008.05.24 19:03:15 ] ccp xhagen > the list of topics before the iceland meeting has to be sent 7 days in advance (an exception due to the short period before the trip).also, as for my 60+ issue, would you leave it already? if ccp finds it to be an issue, they will state so and just reject to make a statement and the issue will be split up for one of the other meetings with ccp."
"no need to get personal....the issue with the '60+ issues' isn't what ccp thinks about it- it's what the players, who want to comment and discuss each of the issues, think about it. thats the point i am trying to make. how can we have trust in a csm that is willing to vote on 60+ issues in one go, without allowing debate and discussion occur on each of them in the forums? players also need to follow the same rules for proposing issues...nine issues presented to ccp in a meeting ain't that bad! i appreciate that time is short, but quality, not quantity, should be the aim. afterall, it's the first time such a meeting has occured...it should set a high standard for future csm's to aspire too!i did miss the 7 day submission in the first meeting- i wasn't being picky by pointing out the 14 day thing, i just thought someone should point it out to avoid disappointment. afterall, i do want the csm council to work, as i'll be standing again next time round.take care,arithron"
"no.what seems to be the case, though, is that people are allowed to support issues repeatedly using the different characters on their accounts."
"no, it was one per account in the election, but it's one per character on the forums. the system isn't totally screwed."
"sorry enjia, my comment is and ccp thinks faction wars will work and be lag free?"
"well, that's mincing words. the 'strategic mistake' was using the titan in the first place when we weren't certain the node could handle it. (it couldn't). i wouldn't fault eve-news for their attempt to tell a story, even if it is a partial work of fiction. they're story tellers.regarding lag... i agree with you that it sucks. i'm also not going to pretend to know the source. i don't believe ccp wants their game to run like garbage. i'm sure if they could find a way to reduce it they would. there are really only two possible answers to why this has not been done in my view.1) they don't know2) the solution is too expensive.while i'm more than happy to raise the issue at the csm and have a chat with the devs and try to at least get some form of answer out of them i don't believe that it's not something they're not already concerned with. i'm sure it will be a long topic of discussion in iceland and it will find its way onto the agenda one way or another."

"supported."
"would be very much appreciated!"
"supported"
"very yes!this was mentioned a few times, but nothing has ever come from it. i think it's about time, personally.overview settings can be quite complex to setup, and having them cease to exist whenever a patch/reinstall/sudden-act-of-god/unfortunate-crash happens is incredibly frustrating."

"yeah man, this bothers me too. i only have 3 accounts, but i have 3 computers :)))ccp pls make these settings exportable/importable.danke"
"supporting dis."
"great idea, often requested.tested fix: take time to get your overview in order on one toon. once it is complete you can then copy/rename char_{your toon id}.dat and user_{the user id).dat to the \"new\"/\"other\" toon/user id's. i.e. original: char_12345678.dat & user_123456.dat copied & renamed to char_1234579.dat & user_123457.dat. this will switch all your settings from one user/toon to another user/toon in entirety."
"yup! it's very important to be done. i've had such problems for all time i'm in eve."
"yes on exportable overview settings! this is actually the one reason i don't go to the local gaming club and use their pcs to play eve, where i also might socialize with other gamers. going to a strange machine, wherein the one thing you don't have is your (many) overview settings, is a dealbreaker."

"i'll give it a +. redesign is needed, but i like the idea of burst weapon more. you shoot a lot, then its cooldown and reaload, and again shooting ... for me its a nice \"alpha strike\". stays in line with alpha strike of old times"
"hmm. you know, this sounds cool. i don't fly minmatar ships, but i have used artillery back when it was the only good weapon system on my ancient prophecy. the idea of shooting four or five powerful shots, then a long reload is kind of appealing. however, if we did this and made their reload speed 15, or even 20 seconds one could argue that an advantage to projectile weapons [the ability to change ammo types to suit your needs] would be negated.artillery already received a damage boost when the hp of all ships was increased, but i wonder if 10% or so more range could help out.i don't want artillery being able to alpha-strike something into oblivion, but i do support the idea of it being very wince inducing. a look into it would be worth it."
"either the guns or the ships, but right now minmatar snipers are outclassed in almost every way and it sucks"

"firstly..if you haven't actually installed and tried bacon.. you shouldn't be posting an opinion. sort of like you shouldn't say a certain food is disgusting without trying it first.. otherwise your argument carries no weight.. its simply an unfounded opinion.secondly.. bacon simply adds an audio queue to something that already exists as a colour queue. if you watch local you identify hostiles by their colour.. (ie: reds or neutral).. bacon simply adds a beep to that colour. it hardly revolutionizes the system nor does it give some crazy advantage.if you are the kind of person that doesn't watch local you probably arn't astute enough to install bacon either. i use bacon.. i use it because i like the sexy audio queue and i like hearing what alliance the reds are from without having to open their profile. it doesn't make me a pvp god.. it doesn't make me unkillable (which is obvious from the various deaths i've enjoyed in the past few weeks). it simply adds something eve should have already anyhow.there is so much drama around such a mundane tool. props to the gunfleet guys for thinking out of the box.. but its not like the add-on has changed the way the game plays. the majority of these posts are full of sound and fury, but ultimately signifying nothing. respect to those who have added constructive criticism."
"however if you read the posts of some of the ones that are fighting so hard for it, you will quickly realize that players you quoted above that are not estute enough to install it are using it. another words because they do not want to put the effort in paying attetion to the game they are using an \"aid\" to make sure they don't loose there ships."
"ok..so first of all i'm going to almost ignore the fact that not one sentence above was completely coherant.. i'll assume its a language barrier which is fair enough.regardless.. they are already using an aid.. its called local.. and another.. called tags. red tags for enemies.. no tag for neutrals.. etc. bacon simply adds one more audible layer of tags. bacon really just adds a sound effect to local. if you really feel that makes people invincible well then fair enough.i personally haven't found targets harder to find or catch than normal. bacon doesn't tell people what ship i'm in or what gate i'm at.. it simply says i'm there which is information readily available through the local channel.will it possibly someday prevent you from catching someone who would otherwise have been busy eating cheatos and not watching the screen for a second? yeah maybe.. but that encounter is so rare you won't miss it.. but you will probably appreciate the features bacon gives you (ie: announcing the alliance and whether the target is war or just unfriendly).to each his own of course.. but its certainly not worth the massive amount of posting drama its getting."

"got my support, i'd like to see eve continually changing, static resource placement doesn't support that."
"yeah i'm aware my proposal is a bit rough chaps. i'd definitely like to see more ideas coming on the issue and if somebody does come up with a killer proposal that does what we want to see here then i'll be very happy to support it."
"weird idea, remove pos. give us moon mining ships, that have pos size shields when in deployed state, put sov on a different system, randomise the amount of resource in a moon, when a resource is depleted it respawns in another random moon within the region (or somewhere in eve for that matter).also give us research ships and manufacturing ships, all of which require some fuel in order to do their jobs in deployed state.the isk sink generated by having to continually rescan to find the good moons helps the economy by removing some of the isk flow.static defences become useless, alliances and corps have to move around as the resources move, or else accept they dont have a guaranteed income from the moons in their area, thus promoting roving gangs and patrols and allowing for ninja moon mining.titans could become mobile stations, given a deployed state.pvp increases as the migrating corps/alliances rub up against each other in pursuit of resources that move around.exploration characters get more employment, scanning a systems moons on contract, or selling the results of a system scan."
"this would become more of a hassle than anything, and i think randomizing would lead to -more- moon mining and the collapse of all prices. think about it.if a corporation wants to have a better chance of finding dysprosium in their systems, they simply have to mine every moon. which over-saturates the market and causes prices on non-rare moon materials to plunge even further than they are now, as every moon mining company has an extreme surplus.the erosion of deposits of materials on moons is not the answer, i believe. i think the answer is partially going to be making the lower end materials more valuable by increasing how many products that can be made with them [make npc trade goods buildable, woooo] or decreasing the amount per cycle rare materials can be extracted by. much like how you can get thousands of tritanium from a single cycle, but only a few dozen megacyte in the same span of time.sorry jade, not signed."
"i offer this as an idea for lessening the impact of static moon mining and add my general support to this issue."
"ok, this will sound real funny coming from an antipirate, but no, pls don't change low sec sentry guns much, they are quite fine as they are. they give some disadvantage to the initial aggressor, but do not turn the battle. the only problem i see with them is that a large number of ships can tank the sentries by just having the large numbers. make the guns concentrate fire, that'll take care of it."
"im a antipirate and id like to see the removal of sentrys in low sec. they do not help the ones getting ganked in camps. all they do is act as an excuse for pirates to avoid players that actually wants to fight them.edit:total removal of sentrys might be a bit drastic. but having sentrys on high/low sec boarder gates and stations should be plenty. rest of them could just be removed imo."
"having the sentry guns on your side is like having an indestructable battlecruiser on your side.an indestructable battlecruiser with perfect tracking i might add.they stop pie's from using nano ships and drones.there good enough as they are.don't complain if you jump into a pvp area in a bear ship or untanked hauler and get ganked.if your anti-pie then stop asking the game to do your work for you , whats the point in that ?gates are fine.not signed."

"such reasoned arguments in a discussion thread.concord doesnt protect you, it provides consequences to those that break the law, to my mind, one of those consequences should be if you lose your ship to them then you don't get an insurance payout on top of what you pick up from the target. it forces people to think about what they are doing more and to weigh the loss/profit balance, to my way of thinking, it introduces skill to the profession of suicide ganking."
"adds skill my ass, all it does is make ships with less than 2+ bil in mods not worth killing and they are rare enough already."
"if they are that rare, how come you see so many concordokkens as you travel through empire space? are gankers shooting everything in sight on the off-chance?"
"theres roughly 30k ppl online in eve at any time during the day or night and concord stays on the gate until after dt so it will add up and seem like a lot (especially if you include customs by mistake). but the fact is that avoiding gankers is easy unless your lazy and that is the real issue not the insurance."

"supported: no insurance for ships lost to concord. can you imagine what the insurance company would say when they got the claim form?"
"all true. and i would love to see those statistics, and if indeed suicide ganking is relatively rare, or if it does not noticeably affect the economy, then i will happily surrender the point. from the anecdotal evidence available to me, though, i think the statistics side with the carebears on this one - but if you can prove me wrong, i'm all ears.that's true. but there are many, many legitimate players who want it too. for the record, as a miner, i vehemently oppose macro miners and other low-lifes, who drive down the prices the real miners can get for their ore and minerals.why should an honest miner have \"special protection\" in hi-sec? because he's a law-abiding citizen minding his own business, doing something that benefits the economy. why should a ganker not? because a ganker is a criminal. the vast majority of new eden is not policed - and in those areas pirating is a perfectly legitimate playstyle. and anyone who ventures there does so knowing the potential gains and risks involved. but ganking in hi-sec is illegal. why would we protect anyone's \"right\" to gank in hi-sec?we are advocating that in hi-sec punishment generally be sufficient to deter crime. unless you're at war, no pilot in hi-sec is a legitimate target. that's the way the game works.yes, ganking in hi-sec should not be financially viable. if there weren't hundreds of players willing to sit in asteroid belts for days shuffling cargo into a jetcan every three minutes, you'd be mining to build your own ships. wanna try it? suicide ganking in hi-sec is bad for the game.yes, it seems fair to me, but yes, it is also supported by eve: eve's economy needs carebear miners, because nobody else is willing to mindlessly sit in asteroid fields. the skill system forces everyone to specialize, and it's a safe bet that the folks who want to specialize in mining are mostly carebears. now, why do gankers need their \"right\" to gank carebears protected? do they only want easy meat, and are afraid to go into 0.0 and pick a fight with someone who could actually defend themselves? now who wants to enjoy a cushy playstyle?(still supported)"
"what about all the accidental concords that happen to everyone and the following petitions. how do you think new players will feel when they get concorded by accident and don't receive the return on insurance they were told to pay for. a ganker won't bother paying for his insurance and still only stand to lose about.this only serves to frustrate new players and i agree as \"cain mjolnir\" said above it will only give you carebears a false sense of security you are still going to get ganked. what happens then when you remove insurance you are all still getting ganked and people aren't receiving insurance for silly mistakes, you are doing more damage to new players here than suicide gankers."
"maybe the solution is not to deny the pirates from ganking but to support those being ganked.imagine at each gate instead of the billboard having a gun it has a large remote shield repair ii and a large remote armor repair ii on it.if someone attacks you the guns and concord go on the hostile, but the billboard starts repairing you. the only way to take out a target is to commit more of a force to assault."
"no, it is your burden of proof to show how rampant the crime is and how much it does impact the economy. if you want to propose change you have to show some sort of solid data. otherwise this is nothing more than emotional unqualified protest.what you are advocating is a wow type of flag able safe zone. you are pushing for absolutely no combat what so ever except for consensual flagged style. show me where it states that a pilot in high sec is not a \"legitimate target\". and show me where it says this is the way the game works.look i agree that something should be done to make it a little more difficult. my view is to give the prospective targets the tools to deal with it. what they are might be another thread.removing insurance is not going to work. you are not identifying the true motivation of why they do it. they do it because they have fun doing it. and its easy. $$ has little to do with it and is a bonus if they get it.high sec is not safe. it is just safer. and turning it into some copy of wow will hurt the game."
"billboards have guns? i think not such a bad idea can't see it happening though."
"fair enough, but the data either of us needs to conclusively prove our point isn't available on the scale we need it. one interesting number i can point to is that currently this topic is the 5th most-supported topic in the assembly hall, out of almost 250.the trouble with compiling data on miners' losses is that on killboards it's impossible to tell who is a real miner and who is a macro, so i admit that these numbers are inherently flawed. there isn't a universal killboard that i can point to, so i'm going to use as an example the killboard of the jihadswarm campaign, which got a lot of attention recently. according to their killboard, in march and april of this year they destroyed 923 exhumers, 25 industrials, and 128 mining barges in hi-sec, for total destroyed value which they calculated at 107 billion isk. that's just losses inflicted by a single group (albeit probably the most active group).why does eve even have a feature allowing legal war declarations if all combat is legit anyway? and war declarations are not necessarily consensual, they're just fair warning. ccp has emphasized that a big part of the game is nonconsensual combat - and indeed, nonconsensual combat can and does occur all over the map. nobody is suggesting that you not be allowed to activate a weapon module on an unflagged pilot in high-security space.can do:attacking unflagged ships in hi-sec is called a \"crime.\" pilots are flagged as \"criminals\" for it. that sounds pretty not legitimate.it's not possible to make it not \"fun\" for the attacker when that's their motivation. but making it extremely expensive, as opposed to in the neighborhood of breaking even, will help deter it. i'm not married to the idea of voiding insurance, though, and i trust ccp to use reasonable judgement in balance and mechanics if it decides to make a change."
"it only takes 1 very useful module, if you call that \"pimped\". a gist booster, 1b+ isk for it. it's extremely useful on a torp setup nowadays since you need flight time/velocity rigs. this makes you a viable target even if the rest of your gear is t2. hardly \"pimped\"..."
"and the fact that the module you are referring to has a very very slim chance of dropping is why insurance should not be removed."
"hello.it has come to our attention that the current nidhoggur bonii are inadequate for the ever-evolving eve universe.as such, a fix is in order.the following is proposed:minmatar carrier skill bonuses:18 degree bonus to pitch per level99% reduction in cpu need for warfare link modules99% reduction in cpu need for tactical logistics reconfiguration modulescan deploy 1 additional fighter per level200% bonus to fighter control range"

"i like the idea, and support it being looked at. on the other hand, i do not think pilots should be able to target modules directly. rather, indirectly.give the option to target 'weapon systems' which would be the highslot rack in general, 'external systems' target the midslots in general, and finally 'internal systems' or 'engineering' which would be the area of the ship where the lowslot module subsystems would be stored.would be kind of neat to blast away at an industrial's cargohold after locking it down completely, and watching as the cargo spills out... or trying to disable someone's tank indirectly.on the counter side, however, these systems should not be easy to destroy or damage. much like starbase weapons, they merely go offline and your crew/automatic systems will be able to repair them when your ship is no longer in danger.i dunno, i'm rambling at this point."

"lavista, does the ability to shoot out someone's mwd or ewar or weapons systems (assuming that's what you're talking about) just turn any gun into a very powerful form of ewar? like why use a webber that only has a 10km range when you can target the mwd of the enemy ship with a much longer range weapon?maybe if the effects were less pronounced than dedicated ewar modules, or the precision needed to target a subsystem was only available within a limited range?"
"perhaps i misunderstood his idea, but i thought it involved logging who was trying to access your *account*. so, if you're cracking it by brute force, you'll see a whole pile of failed attempts, and it will be (hopefully) self-evident that someone has been trying to do something you don't want them to do with your account.anyway, i'll support discussion of security options because i know enough to know i am insufficiently paranoid, but there are people who are properly paranoid, and i'm sure that group is even greater among those who frequent the forums than eve in general. (... and the nature of the game means that we likely self-select with more tech-savvy people than in general.)"
"i believe that a list of the last few login attempts is somewhat of a standard practice now, and support that. other standard practices are, of course, the secret question / secret answer stuff, preventing changes unless confirmed by email, and password complexity rules. i am not sure that locking the account to an ip address/range will be considered justified by ccp; they can already see and log the computer name and address from which you're logging in, and a simple look at the backlog will reveal a hacked account or not. so it's a matter of coding this extra ip address locking stuff in order to prevent a call to tech support to have your stuff restored, except that they'll have to provide tech support for people who lock the wrong ip address or have exotic setups at home / elsewhere. roaming laptops from hotels, for example.i will, however, support ccp having a look and brainstorm about account security. one big vulnerability is the fact that character sales force us to reveal account names, which is half the information needed for brute force hacks. maybe they can fix that somehow."
"cute pubbies ittfyi it shouldn't take a supercomputer to handle >60 ships in a system, no matter what types of ships they are, but the devs keep deluding themselves that stacks are the enemy when they very clearly need something more capable than python"
"there's around 240k paid accounts, but a lot of them buy more than a month at a time, so $36m a year is a decent approximation. according to wikipedia, their revenues last year were just under $36 million, so your estimate is even pretty good. but the question you have to ask is how much of that is free to just pile on a bigger server farm? they've got 250 employees - even assuming $50k/year average salary and benefits(and payroll taxes, of course), that's $12.5 million in salaries alone, and depending on the structure of the workforce and icelandic law, that's probably a low estimate. add in bandwidth costs, which are probably in the millions, the normal server upgrades they are doing on at least a semi-regular basis, advertising costs, office costs, and all that other stuff, and i'd imagine that they genuinely do not have the money to just plug in enough servers to fix the problem. ccp isn't google, don't expect them to spend like they are. i'm not a mmo coder, but my best guess is that the graphics on your system have no interaction whatsoever with ccp's servers. they'll be stored, rendered, and displayed entirely locally, because there's no reason to stream them centrally in any form but a patch. the client will just get an instruction like \"harbinger, at grid coodinates xyz, orientation thetaphi\" and do all the work on your machine. it'll be similar in other mmo's - they'll stream a character's appearance attributes(gear, etc.), but they won't tell your computer what texture to use where. you'd need a fibre optic line to handle that kind of bandwidth, anyways - dsl can't come close."

"i can understand ccp isn't god and can't fix everything 100% especially with limited (financial) resources, though this isn't just regular lag cash warbash is talking about. i've been at a fleet battle where for a period of 10 to 15 minutes you literally couldn't do anything. nothing worked. this isn't really the same as activating a module and waiting a few seconds before it responds. this is looking at a still image for a period long enough to take a toilet break, make coffee, grab a news paper and read it entirely while finishing your coffee, and maybe then finally your eve client will respond.i am not exagerating though naturally if i see \"lag\" of this nature i won't go away setting coffee. i'd be frantically waiting for an oppurtunity to safe my ship - waiting for the fog to clear you could say.now i'm very interested to hear how ccp deals with abnormal lag in relation to \"normal\" lag, how this affects their reimbursement policy and if they draw a line at all where there's simply \"too much\" lag. ignoring players about the severity of problems caused by lag and piling all such complains onto one big \"ignore it\"-pile will result in an ever-increasing number of unsatisfied players. and i'm sure that's not what ccp wants."
"another lag thread.allegedly (and a dev can correct me if im wrong) the reason we lag out so hard is the original code does not multithread what happens in space.so its great they have all these nice servers and all these processors, but when everything that happens in space (aka, not the market, or chat or eve mail) but all ships/weapons/collision detection/physics and so on happens on one thread in the processor... that node cant handle that because its not being sent out to multiple threads.recoding this would be a b!tch as its not easy to rip the games foundations apart and recode it.this is something we live with until the eve engine is overhauled."

"since the mighty warbash clan has posted i will respond. first of all, i would have to agree, that response from support was terrible. there were many other far more constructive answers he/she could have given you. next i would like to talk about what \"lag\" really is. there are three specific components which result in what is known as lag in the players eyes. the first of these is client-side lag. client-side lag is caused by incapable cpu and/or graphics processors. it can also occur when data is loaded from mass storage devices (aka hard drives). i think we all understand this lag quite well so i will not cover it any further. next is network lag. network lag is a result of a large amount of data being sent over the internet from the server to the client. the server sends information in the form of data packets. the type of data packets all online games use are called udp packets. udp packets are just sent with no confirmation if they made it to their intended destination or not. as the information being sent to each client increases (during fleet battles) the server sends more and more udp packets and just expects they will arrive at their destination. most of the time they do, but sometimes they do not. they can also arrive out of order. (ever started to warp away just to be sucked back to the fight and see your ships carcass floating there as you get insta-podded? obviously something happened in the wrong order.) additionally, just because the server has a large network bandwidth (i garuntee you the eve clusters have to be massive) doesn't mean every other point on the network data packets are sent through to reach your computer has a large bandwidth. in other words networks outside of ccp and your connection control the quality of service you get when playing a game over the internet. one more note on network lag. the current network protocols used to transfer data is archaic as far as computer time goes. some attempts have been made to change this \"ancient\" system, but too much of the world's network infrastructure is built on it. an improvement to network protocol standards would solve many issues we experience."
"finally there is server-side lag. in eve, this occurs when an area sees heavy player use (duuh). when this type of lag occurs the server cannot send information about the game state to clients in a timeley manner. this results in your client waiting for data. sometimes his manifests as the entire eve universe pausing before your eyes. other times an animation your ship was executing (say accelerating) will simply continue even if something has occurred to change that state. when the player experiences \"lag\" it is usually results from all three of the fore mentioned types of lag occurring at the same time. more players in a sector results in more server-side calculations, more network traffic, and more calculations for your client to handle. you are the master of your client computer -you can solve this problem. no one is the master of the internet. ccp can do something about their servers design. so this brings us to a specific question we must ask of ccp: if i were to make the most powerful gaming pc money can buy and plugged it straight into the network switch your server cluster is connected to, then proceeded to get in a massive fleet battle would i experience lag? enough lag to make the fight unplayable? if the answer to these questions is yes then ccp has a serious problem that needs to be addressed. but what type of problems? what type of questions? what type of answers? here is a miniscule set of possible questions. client side (these issues could slow down even the best computers): -are ships, stations, and other entities on the same grid being rendered even if i am too far to see them as anything more then a dot? -are ships at a far distance being fully rendered and fully textured even if i could not possibly detect whether they are or not? -is it possible to choose how many items are rendered? -is it possible to render entities only within a certain radius of my ship?sever side (i am certain most of these have been addressed. i am placing them here for the purpose of users) -have the heavily used, heavily spawned processes been fully optimized? -are systems seeing heavy usage being dynamically load balanced against systems that see little or no use? -are heavily used database calls being pre-fetched and saved to reduce redundancy?this list could go on forever.in closing i would like to reiterate the main point here:you control how much your client computer lags. ccp controls how much their server lags. no one controls how much the internet lags. even if ccp had the computational power of every computer in the world combined, even if you had a gaming computer pulled through a time warp from 20 years in the future, you would still experience lag due to network issues.something needs to be done, but understand the limitations."
"ccp should just stop reimbursing completely rather than suffer the whines it generates. reimbursing for lag would be a monumentally stupid decision for ccp.lag will always be an issue unless they set a hardlimit on how many people can be in a system/engage in a fleet fight."
"you are quite far off, i think.you are right. there is a potential for lag being manifested by network and processing power on the computer. but in most cases, this is rarely the case. the amount of information sent to the client, in terms of actual size, is minimal. eve as a client is a dumb telnet client, the only real calculations that is done, which has to be considered as a potential bottleneck, is the graphics. so you state that network latency will eventually be the bottleneck. but even eve can easily run on a 100ms latency connection. the bottleneck will never be there, unless it started sending bigger packages and many of them.but that isn't what this thread is about. the issue as it is now, is that all things in a system is handeled by 1 core(otherwise known as a node, 1 single cpu core). due to the inability for a cpu to scale in speed, lag isn't simple to fix. instead of scaling in speed, we have to scale in cores. due to the stackless python architecture, one can't just split tasks out between cores. neither is the current network architecture of the cluster, ethernet, fast enough for that.ccp is working on reworking the network engine for their cluster, in order to enable these scenarios. they have, as far as i hear, a test cluster with inifiband at the iceland office. once that is implemented on the london cluster, we will see that ccp can increase the performance of the cluster by quite a bit."
"isn't it embarrassing that a csm member rather than explaining csm isn't even about or in any way able to deliver on some generic and silly advocacy, instead encourages the lag issue and the csm misunderstanding with it? the only answer to this is: not in our purvey."
"the message was quite clear. but let me summarize it, just for you:currently the main bottleneck is not the computer the client is running or, nor the internet connectionthe server software is based on stackless python, which can't make use of several threadsthe cluster architecture can't handle moving the cpu load between several cpu's.ccp is working on rewriting the software to make use of infiniband, which allows them to scale the performance."
"lag is a known issue and occurs in generally predictable conditions. ccp has a plan to deal with lag via two methods:a) code improvementb) hardware upgrades (in the form of solid state drives, faster 64-bit chips with more cores, and perhaps most importantly....infiniband replacing ethernet on the cluster)in terms of the \"hardware\" aspect; csm can not run the procurement office at ccp, these are all business decisions on ccp's part that would have a material impact on their financial statements. in terms of the code improvement, ccp is working on this.further, the idea of developing something that would be granular enough to specifically log and track all player actions to the point that some would like would result in two things;a) wasted time and resources as some of the issues are already being worked on via improvementsb) additional overhead and processing power, resulting in more lagand lastly...if you feel the desperate need to be reimbursed for the \"evils\" wrought upon you and yours as a result of this, that's truly unfortunate that you would think ccp gives handouts every time some guy swears up and down that \"lag\" killed him. wouldn't have money left for upgrades once people view ccp as one big atm every time their connection farts.anyway, there are other games at the end of the day. play the one you enjoy is my best advice."
"in your haste to rebut me i don't think you understood or read what i wrote."
"first of all i dont respond to alts, who act as hacks for this provided. please reply with a character you truly use. no ghost reply should be give weight and they should be consider a hack for the provide. dont let them take us off topic. this subject is for real players with real lag issues regarding customer service responses and denial by the provided that problem exist. when you are in a fleet of 65 people and all of them tell you they are frozen- the game is frozen or that they are getting 1 frame each minute. its is clear to me there is a service provider problem. first of all ccp doesnt acknowledge that there is a lag problem and doesnt provide a system for documentation for problem, and customers service chooses to blame the client and tell them indirectly that they are lying which is unacceptable on any level of client customer service interaction. so up grades will not work with that type of position. maybe there is a multiple stream problem as stated by one of the replys above. but i have been playing this game for almost 4 years. large fleet battles always pause and remain slow. its not my connection point or my computer for i have played on many different computers. plus the people im in voice chat with confirm there is a fleet wide lag problem.(winners never lag & losers always lag- 4 years of research here) that tell me that its not anyone single players computer, but instead the interface- server provider. this is standard industrial knowledge. if my web page crashes i dont blame the customers. first of all farrah is a hack, secondly ccp doesnt admit to lag. 4 years of playing and speaking with people of the community it is clear this lag problem is unique to this game. most other games drop you if it lags saving your character from unfair loses. in eve if you lag you character stays online in a combat zone. so most players do not disconnect and try and ride the lag out until they can take action within the game. however if you lag you die, so no action is possible. if you dont lag you win. i have 9 accounts and i only lose combat if i lag. some lag is understandable. but this lag issue is years old now, and im not sure i can keep investing in a game that i cant triumph do to these issues, poor customer service and no documentation procedures to address a problem that is on going. i yet to here a player say, hey man i had 20 minutes of lag and came out of lag and killed 20 ships and routed them all. laggers always lose and with no way to log off, and no way to document the problem other that the petition through the customer service. i feel i am not playing a game but instead gambling. eve should address these issues before expanding this summer. i only write on this topic because i do love playing eve but the lag issues make the game not as fun, knowing that you have to avoid gang fights with more than 5 people involved in the other fleet."
"lol this is a funny thread."
"i think two different things are being addressed here:1. eve customer support: i found the gms to be copying and pasting replies to almost any addressed topic, and to generally favor complete in-action in regards to almost any issue. this pertains not only to lag, but to any aspect of customer support. i find the gms in this game much less helpful than in any other mmo i've played (which is a shame since this game has the potential to be a better mmo than any of them).2. lag : large fleet battles are infamous for lag... this has to change if this game is to remain on the market. unfortunately i've also noticed more lag in mission/mining systems recently (dodixie anyone?? ). hopefully a way of handling lag will be implemented (cap system population perhaps)."
"i agree with lavista on the proposed causes of fleet lag. and that said you need to understand that although lag happens for each of the players in the system (who end up waiting for tq to send their client instructions) the server could be operating at peak, sending an immense amount of data out to each of the clients in a system, even though each of those clients would receive updates once every 10 seconds or so. the problem doesn't usually lie in client when you receive a message along the lines of: \"an attempt is underway to activate that module..\" etc since if you were having client side lag your pc wouldn't have effectively registered the attempt to activate the module in the first place to whine about it.you need to step back and look at the entire picture of what's happening during a fleet fight.client side computers are sending multiple requests to activate modules, steer their ships, and target targets. sometimes also controlling drones. although miniscule in computer numbers, the data travelling between the server and its 600 or so clients in a huge fleet fight would be at least 4800 (worst case, all ships have 8 turrets to activate, the at least is thinking about tracking computers, mwds and the like) sets of packets that need to come in, be interpreted by the server and then sent back to each of the clients. each client needs updates to everything that's going on in the current grid. this means that everytime somebody else in the fleet activates their 8+ modules, steers their ship or targets someone, every client on grid usually gets informed in some way or other. that information would total around the same as how much data the server receives when it activates the modules, it would need to send that amount out to each client.your client needs to then interpret this which it usually does in a timely fashion. modules get confirmed as active, and damage starts to happen.it's not that ccp has set the server dial to lag and stepped back laughing maniacally, its just that theres a buttload of **** happening at once in one of these fights.now, on to what should/could be done about it...ccp should investigate the load ability on their servers and post it somewhere. allowing players to have the choice to whether engage knowing there'll be huge lag. the reimbursement policy could then be focused around this, saying that if you engaged in a system with 300+ people (if that was decided to be the limiting number) then you'd get no ship. but if lag happened (and don't be silly about it ccp, its as simple as seeing how often each client gets sent an update) reimbursement could be considered based on other factorsdisallow systems to accept new players past a certain limit. it makes sense since someone would be controlling the stargates and have information relating to how many people are in system. this however will lead to people filling the system up with your players to prevent others from getting in. although currently the other players would just get in, but then crash and die losing their ships and not being much better off than if they were just disallowed access to the system in the first place."
"whatever ccp decides to do, they need to accept their customers claims on what's going on with their servers. although we all know lag happens, it should be more obvious when 50 people yell about it at the same time or at least start making ccp investigate it.if lag was brought into the reimbursement policy, there'd be a big issue ensuing with players calling in lag left and right with claims. since there is no easy and foolproof way to measure that lag happened, it would be a hit and miss reimbursement idea. where some people in an engagement would get reimbursed while others didn't.as it stands right now, big fleet battles bring losses. if you can't afford to lose your ship risking the fight, don't go."
"i believe ccp has said what the issue is, the network code and the way the game loads system data and sends it to the client.remember they are still using network code designed for dial-up and the loading is still designed for dial-up. they said they are working on the network code but if they change that they will also need to change a great deal of back end code that loads the data to send to the client.i agree that they should stop with the new stuff for a while and finish the \"need for speed\" changes."
"kablammo"
"the guy got 2436 votes on a platform of outposts going boom. that's over 4x the amount of support as the thread asking ccp to roll back a proposed subscription fee increase. if your position gets 4x as much support as \"we want to pay less money\", i'd say you've got a pretty solid right to enact your platform. face it, man - this is exactly what jade was elected for."
"or you could argue instead of making things up. 2436 votes for jade is not 2436 votes for destructible stations. i can make up some numbers too, 22,215 people voted for other candidates, therefor voting against jade's destructible outpost plan (the only plan to feature destructible outposts). further, 2436 votes is not a mandate, as it only represents about 1% of eligible voters, and about 10% of votes."
"if we're going to bring up vote numbers, i would like to point out that hardin, who is opposed to this idea and made a very compelling case against it, got only 43 fewer votes than jade did. jade has no mandate whatsoever, despite what he may like to think.it's also entirely possible to say that, with exposure to how jade really acts, some of the people who voted for jade might not have voted for him if they knew this is what they would get. the same goes for any candidate in any election. election campaigns are all spin and no substance, and if there's one thing star fraction's always been good at, it's spin-doctoring. this thread is good evidence of that.so let's not drag voter numbers and 'mandates' into this, as they're both meaningless.as for jade's 'why shouldn't we suggest this to ccp?' argument. simple. it's not the best solution to the problems of 0.0, as anyone that actually lives and fights there will tell you. it's not even in the top five, by my guess. what concerns do i hear about? fleet lag. capital blobs. pos warfare. never have i heard a complaint about outposts. why try to sidetrack ccp with a nonissue when there are so many other things you could work on that would help immeasurably more? the only reason to do so is if it were your own personal mission, which we've more or less concluded this to be."
"no, he got 2436 votes for being a windbag. no one actually read the candidates' proposals, they just went \"ooh, there's a name i know, he seems smart.\" and voted. the vast majority of people who voted had no clue whatsoever what their respective candidates stood for. it was a pure popularity contest that came down to how many words you could throw at your voters.even if he was elected on that issue (he wasn't - it's something i'll be [issue]ing about next week) it doesn't matter. being in the majority does not make the majority right. it just makes the majority ****ing stupid.you'll notice there's been very very little actual discussion on this. there have been alot of very, very good high-quality posts as to why this is a terrible idea, yet nearly no responses to them. instead jade, the chairman of the csm and the mighty master of words, has selectively responded to the poorest criticisms, and massively overplayed the agreement he's receiving in this thread which apparantly comes entirely from his corpmates.why do you think that is? i'll tell you why - it's because when you actually put jade constantine's positions and statements up for scrutiny, you always come to the same conclusion. they're there to further his personal goals over the goals of the csm and of eve's populace. he said it himself in his campaign, many, many times.he has never held 0.0 space, and never intends to. he wasnts to shift the advantages in 0.0 warfare away from territory holders to the nomadic powers that he has always been a part of. from this there's 2 simple conclusions.he's got absolutely no experience of what he's talking about, and all his proposals just happen to be advantageous to nomadic powers - they lose nothing from outposts being removed. or hey, what about the statement that \"nanos aren't a problem\"? that's totally in line with real eve balance, and totally isn't just another statement to prop up his personal goals.though at this point, it should probably be pointed out that these proposals would hinder more than help nomadic powers. they rely, by and large, on low-skilled peons in large alliances for prey, with the occasional large fight. reduction in outpost count would seriously depopulate swathes of 0.0, leaving them very few people to fight except those powerblocs they so despise. it's obvious this proposal hasn't been considered past a cursory thought from any perspective. there's so many flaws it's unreal."
"i have yet to see how invincible outposts are unbalanced when you can always take them over. it seems to be an idea solely because you think it would be cool and damnit eve sandbox whatever should be that way. your support of your conclusions has been rather poor as well.go ahead and do it though. just exactly like you want to. as long as the devs code in some easy way to turn it back like now after everyone realizes how ****ed up this became. personally i think way to try and fix blob warfare would greatly increase chances for little guys who can't throw 500 capitals into a fight."
"i'm going to ask people to be a little more respectful in their tone when responding to this thread please. and do make an effort to address the op post. certainly interested in hearing fresh opinions too - i think we've heard enough from the usual suspects, how about some opinions from other sources on the issue?so lets address the nature of eve here. don't fly what you can't afford to lose. why should anything in 0.0 space be indestructible? can people who oppose raising this discussion issue answer that question please?"
"i consider i'm actually supporting the sandbox here, and promoting alternative methods of warfare beyond simply playing the territorial holding game. i honestly think its a mistake to have invulnerable structures in 0.0 on a fundamental level and its been directly responsible for a lot of the stasis in 0.0 and development of capital-ships-online. (combined with overwhelming defense advantage and broken sovereignty tools of course).as for supporting conclusions:i'm obviously not going to reply to personal attacks or questions of my experience in-game on this issue - these are not constructive posts and i'll simply discount them. neither is there any point addressing repetitive posts that are simply repeating the same argument endlessly without introducing anything new into the discussion, once i've answered a query i'm not going to repeat myself ad infinitum. such posts are pointless and a waste of everybody's time. i'm posing questions in the op post, answers to those are what i'm interesting in hearing, and i'm certainly happy to pick and choose through the background noise to reach the interesting points for debate."
"oh, god this is ripe. bring back any memories? i believe that falls under both categories. both questioning a pilot's experience and a personal attack. hypocrisy and lies. just like real life politics eh?a sandbox has to have walls, darlin', or it all floods out.and also - if your point is that correct, you'd respond to all posters, regardless of the manner they decide to respond. there are plenty of good posts in here that've seen no responses (hardin, alex shurk, ikar kaltin for example) and it'd be interesting to see what you'd think on those before i pitch in the rest of my opinion. you could, as you say, \"pick and choose through the background noise.\" after all, you of all people should be used to filtering through walls of text."
"the reason everyone is ****ting up your pet thread is because you keep asking questions that have already been answered. go read hardin's post and shut up."
"aye i will try and keep it simple. i completely support hardin's post. i can cut and re-paste it if it makes you feel better. you have yet to respond to hardin. and since this is your pet project and as your defenders say-this was what you ran on-i do believe that the burden is on you to represent your case. i dont think the burden is on the eve populace to convince you why you shouldnt. the position of csm and chair dont carry with it the mandate to champion your own personal, poorly presented issues to ccp.so as my official position i say no to your proposal. and i reference hardin's well thought out and well presented posts as my official position. i will further reference various goonie posts as my secondary and tertiary positions. you ran on a populist platform of dynamism, anti-large alliance-your poorly thought out proposal runs counter to that. it will help the huge alliances and hurt the small ones. and interestingly enough-whether its accepted or not jade fraction will still never dock in station that they siezed and will never enjoy the thrill of pushing the destroy button if by some horrible turn of events the current insanity sees daylight. the fraction lacks the vision, leadership, organization and ability to achieve this-changing the game mechanics wont solve that problem."
"because the status quo is far more balanced than the proposed change. that's the short version. the long version is the pages and pages you continue to ignore, probably hoping that the short attention-span audience hasn't read those pages and you can paint the picture that we're not answering your questions.*edit*and to echo vant's sentiments, i'd be very interested to see a rebutal to hardin's post. or any of our posts where we go into detailed reasoning of our position. rather than repeatedly asking us for those reasons.*edit2*actually, it's a laundry list of what jade refers to when he says that 0.0 has stagnated...so i'm pretty sure it relates directly to the topic. just to restate the point, destructable outposts will have none of the positive impacts jade states. indeed, destructable outposts will make all of the problems in 0.0 (that jade does agree are problems) even worse."
"thats not really an answer is it though? you think its reasonable that out of everything in 0.0 outposts should continue to get a free pass from destructible status because the status quo is better than the alternative? by whose measure? and better for whom?as for the rest. yes, i have ignored pages of personal attacks and flames. and i'll continue to do so."
"let's go rl for a second. i'm a canadian, and the last canadian federal election had four serious parties, of which the conservatives won 40% of the seats on 36% of the votes. it's a minority parliament, and the three opposition parties, all of whom despise at least two of their five main promises, could easily have blocked those promises from being implemented. but they didn't - they respected the conservative win, and allowed them to go forward with the platform that won them the election, raising only token opposition when it came time for the vote. why? two reasons - one, they respect the public's choice, and two, they know the public sure as hell wouldn't respect their choice if they decided to asset that they knew better than the voters. and this is a pattern repeated pretty often in all sorts of political systems - the person who wins, by however small a vote total, gets to implement their core platform. you know how many votes you need to win an election? one more than the other guy. you talk small margins of victory, i talk about jade having 42 spare votes. as for his voters, i'm one of them, and i read every word of his 13-post manifesto. for that matter, i read most of the other players manifestos too. now, i'm a geek of the worst sort, but given this game's population, i doubt there's that small a number of us. don't assume voters are stupid, or even lazy - if they were all that lazy, they wouldn't have voted. and i'm relatively happy with what i've gotten - i wanted to see his bounty hunting scheme come up first, but this works too. and all this talk about how the sky is falling is fearmongering of the first order. if it's really that bad an idea, ccp still gets to tell the csm to go hang, regardless of their decision on this matter. i don't mind hashing this all out, or even suggesting that he's just doing it as a sly plot to further the goals of his alliance(though i generally think conspiracy posts are silly). but this is a perfectly legitimate topic for discussion, and it should go to ccp for further discussion there. the whole point of this process was democracy, let's not throw that away this soon."
"you are not addressing the objections of those who say no. valid points have been raised and supported by various groups with their own statements. no reasonable argument against the points raised has been presented or defended. \"talk about it anyway\" is not valid. we have fault with the position of this proposal and have substantial evidence. support your position. address what has been said.we say no."
"hardin's post while a decent summary of the anti outpost argument brought nothing new to the table. its all been said and debated before - we didn't agree then, we won't agree now. for an account of the original discussion i'd advise a look at this thread.i am interested in discussing these issues with hardin face to face and in the context of csm/ccp discussions as part of the formal agenda, but i don't see a point in re-hashing old debates with exactly the same material as previously presented."
"yes, actually. i think a proposal that will fix none of the problems it's proposed to fix and indeed makes those problems worse is a bad proposal. i think the status quo is certainly better than a bad idea. i can really only speak for myself, same as anyone else in here. so i suppose by my measure, as someone who has participated in campaigns to successfully defend and successfully conquer outposts.better for smaller alliances and the folks your idea supposedly champions, actually."
"and you've said no every time the issue has been raised, in exactly the same way for exactly the same reasons. we had this discussion when it was first raised on chatsubo and nothing in your point of view has changed. you haven't persuaded me, i haven't persuaded you. we agree to differ - hence there is absolutely no point to me addressing the identical points of view you express in every thread on the subject pezzle. you are heavily invested in the pro indestructible outpost lobby - you believe your personal gameplay will be damaged by any change. that obviously makes you viewpoint heavily biased and pretty emotive. now i can (and have) calmly explained the position and proposal to you, but nothing i say is ever going to convince you that your gameplay is not going to hurt by this.comes a time when we simply agree to differ and we appeal to a higher arbiter and ask ccp if they feel 0.0 is ready for destructible outposts. that is what this thread is about."
"but that doesn't make him wrong"
"don't pull that ****. don't even think about pulling that ****. if this is a proposal worth a damn, you can defend it on better grounds than \"all my opponents are whiners who just think that the change will be bad for them personally\". admittedly, the crap they're claiming about you is just as bad, and just as stupid, but you're the op here, and your job is to explain why the idea is good, not why the opposition is bad. do so or give up the debate for lost, because if this is your best defence then it already is."
"you say (in your opinion) it won't fix the problems. i (and many others) say it will. we will agree to differ. yep many of us have gotten involved in 0.0 campaigns, many of us know the state of play, the problems and the issues. this is a difference of opinion between equally informed parties who wish differing things for the future of the 0.0 game. its inevitable there will be disagreements - some of which will never be resolved and we'll have to trust to the good judgment of ccp to make the right call. you say its better for small alliances to keep the status qup. i believe its better for small alliances to break the status quo. plenty of folks agree with you. plenty of folks agree with me. its a hot topic and an emotive issue. all the more reason for it to be raised as an issue so we can get ccp's opinion and statement of intention for the future."
"i'm not going to get sucked into the personal attack game that a lot of folks who agree with me () seem to be going for...but until you, jade, and star fraction have had to go from zero to outpost to defending outpost to conquering outpost...you are not \"equally informed.\" no moreso than someone who has never flown nanos is \"equally informed\" as to the capabilities and weaknesses as someone who regularly flies them. except on, like, a hugely grander scale."
"that was the point i was making herschel. everyone can allege bias and invested interest. what we have here are people arguing from partisan self-interest. of course i'm every bit as biased as they are - i would like to see a more open combat environment in 0.0 with territorial alliances taking more risk to claim space. i believe that suits the objectives of enhanced dynamism in the territorial game. i want to see 0.0 alliances taking horrible losses, seeing their outposts burned and being bankrupted back to empire. i want to see an end to indestructible capture the flag gameplay and some real consequence again - i want to see the rise and fall of empires and opportunity for new powers from the ashes of the old.but don't think for a moment i'm the only one biased here this is why i'm saying there isn't much point debating with people who have already made their minds up long ago on the basis of raw self interest. lets hear what ccp thinks - i'm actually intensely curious as to where they see the territorial wargame of eve online going in the future. and i know for a fact a lot of other players are very interested too and would not be happy to see the opportunity to ask these questions pass because the pro-invulnerable outpost lobby wish to defend their own position at all costs."
"again we'll agree to differ garreck. you will believe your involvement with an outpost/pos/sovereignty-tool reliant power will give you a special insight into the argument. i'll say that my involvement with roving pvp, attacker/raider/forces gives me a special insight into the argument. we both play the same game, we both know how these things work. its an invalid debating technique to claim that only outpost owners can correctly critique a problem with unbalanced 0.0 outpost mechanics however. and that is the route that leads to nonsense personal attacks that must be disregarded by all rational people. this really isn't just about outpost people. its also about raider/aggressive alliances that are currently denied the opporunity to hurt outpost people. at the moment the outpost alliances have everything their own way - in order to fight them an aggressor needs to commit to become just like their enemy and transform into a sitting territorial power. and i'm saying that i don't think this is right. you can certainly disagree with me. but you can't say i don't have a fair perspective from the point of view of the people i am speaking for in this argument. ultimately i'd like to hear what ccp think."
"myself, among many others, have brought the argument that disproves this statement. we've presented it in a civil manner and i've stayed as non-partisan as is possible in this. if you'd be so kind as to respond, i'd be much obliged.but if you missed it, here it is again in short.outposts are not just methods of holding territory, they are methods of denying territory. to project power across a region, you absolutely must deny your opponents strategic bases of operation. the only way to do that is to hold the outposts. if you allow destruction of outposts, you do not need to extend your forces in the same manner to strategically control space (tactical control in the small-gang theatre is irrelevant). this means that the advantage goes to the entity that gains most from denying space without extending their forces. that is, the established power blocs.if bob could have 3 regions either side of delve simply filled with dead ground, why wouldn't they do it? same for ra and the east. in an environment with depopulated barren 0.0 with no infrastructure, smaller alliances cannot flourish, and larger alliances can be even more secure in their space, safe in the knowledge no one has the strategic infrastructure to challenge them. you say this like the two are exclusive. it's not like poses need bashing/defending 23/7. what do you think sov holders do the rest of their time?a pity, because judging by the approval count (30 at time of posting, from well over 200 posts) the people you represent do not. it'd be irreseponsible of you to raise this issue as a csm representitive. remember you sit on the csm now. you are no longer jade constantine, but a representative. if the people you're representing don't want you to raise the issue, you don't raise the issue."
"as this very assembly hall demonstrates there are plenty of issues. many of which look to be comparitively popular and easy to implement and will incrementally and collectively improve eve as a game for all of us.i do not see why we are bringing forward a proposal which has no real consensus and which would require significant research and input from ccp, when there are many more other worthy proposals that may not even end up being discussed becuase of the time we spend debating issues like this.in business we are encouraged to go for the 'low-hanging' fruit to provide 'instant wins'. i want csm to be seen by the eve playerbase as a success and i do not think that will happen if the first csm ignores doesn't produce results.yes there is a place on csm for longer term thinking - i am just not sure it is necessarily in this first term - when there are so many other things we could be focusing on and improving short term!"
"respectfully alex, no you haven't. you have argued a point of view. you have told us your opinion. you have made \"best guess\" assessments of what might happen and you've given an insight into your thought process. you haven't conclusively proved or disapproved anything however. we are all intelligent people here and we can reach our own conclusions and often its sensible to understand that we will agree to disagree. i haven't been persuaded by your arguments. this doesn't mean i think you are \"stupid\" or \"foolish\" it just means on this issue i'm not finding your logic compelling.also, you need to remember that i have proposed consultancy with ccp in the op. i want to hear their point of view and intentions for future 0.0 territorial warfare. i would like to know (as would a large portion of the 0.0 player base) whether they would consider destructible player outposts part of their long term plan. since i'm asking a question here i'm not interested in the minutiae of \"sky-is-falling\" eve is doomed if x,y,z happens debate. i'm not interested in endless circular game-theory goons will ruin 0.0 hypothesis. i am interested in knowing whether people think this is a question that is worth asking. now hardin has answered \"no\" - on the grounds that he thinks there are more important issues. fine, i disagree with him, but i respect his point of view and he has at least addressed the principle. i'm seeing good approval posts, healthy discussion, and its an issue that deserves an answer from ccp. its my role as a csm rep to ask the questions that need asking and by consequence i will be asking the csm committee to recommend this issue for formal consultation. if i'm outvoted i'm outvoted, i'm not going to sulk about it, we've signed up to a democratic process and we'll see where that takes us."
"it sounded more like you were adopting their tactics than mocking them to me, but i'll let it go.i guess i've got a few questions here about your fundamental assumptions. i think i know where you're coming from, but just to be sure:1) do you believe that it should be possible for the biggest, best-organized power bloc to lose a war under normal circumstances? assume here that \"biggest, best-organized\" refers to actual combat-tested strength and ability, not how good they look on paper. 2) how much are you worried by the prospect of there being fewer stations in 0.0 space, and the space presumably becoming less amenable to residency as a result?3) in a war between a small space-holding alliance with one outpost and 200 members, and a large space-holding alliance with ten and 2000, assuming equal levels of overall competence, who do you think will benefit more from this change? how will the end result of the war(i.e., the small side presumably losing) be different as a result? 4) would you be proposing this idea if you were a member of a major space-holding alliance? how about if you ran one - and if yes, how would you justify this to your membership? i know i'm stretching the counterfactual a bit far there, given what i know of your play style(something about being a nomadic hooker...), and i'm pretty sure that your answer has to be \"yes\", but i'd like to see your explanation."
"well, first, you've ignored my points yet again. good job there.and second, you've ignored my points again. good job there.if you raise this issue on the csm council, you will be flying in the face of everything it supposedly stands for (supposedly keeping ccp in check and on track for what the players want).right now, this topic has the lowest approval count out of any of the seriously active topics. you have the same count as the \"change titan models to monster trucks\" issue. if you raise this issue at council, despite the massive amount of negative feedback (that you've pointedly ignored) all you will be proving is that the csm is an experiment that should not be repeated again.you've consulted the players, come back with a fairly resounding \"no\" (14% of posts in this topic showing support, and those are the ones who've bothered to post). to take this further would be sheer egotistical prattery. you'd be ignoring your consituents and going for personal views over what you're supposed to be doing.remember this. these are your words. ask yourself, in all honestly, deep down. is this a question that needs asking? over the thousands of bugs, issues, errors and discontinuities that plague this game day in and day out, is this petty personal crusade really worth asking? you might not take your \"role\" seriously enough to consider that honestly, but remember it's other people's money you're playing with."
"why not? i have the decency to at least provide reasoning when i'm discounting your points, the very least you could do is provide me the same courtesy. otherwise your \"respectfully..\" means absolutely sod all.ed: this just in, this topic now has less support than replacing titan models with monster trucks."
"this is the most debate-heavy of the big threads too - there's actual discussion here, unlike most of the others. discussion implies posts, but it doesn't imply support, because the same person can't vote twice. i'm not saying it's a huge support ratio, but it's a lot higher than 14% if you measure thumbs:players instead of thumbs:posts."
"what special insight do you have and how is it relevant to the argument? not a sarcastic snipe. it's well out on the table what special insight i feel i have and how it relates...but a vague claim that you have equal insight doesn't just make it so. i'm seriously wondering what it is you've learned in your roving gangs and patrols that provided you with the vision of destructable outposts fixing the problems you perceive. in this case i think it's relevant, actually. if an individual who has no history of claiming sovereignty and also has a loudly proclaimed intent of not ever holding sovereignty (for valid roleplay reasons) starts throwing around ideas that will effect those who do hold sovereignty...the validity of that person's argument needs to be scrutinized carefully. as does, perhaps, the intent.raider/aggressive alliances are not denied the ability to hurt outpost people. they're simply denied the opportunity to force a strategic level of risk on outpost people without claiming equal risk themselves. that's the very definition of balance. raiders risk their ships to hurt other peoples' ships...in the case of star fraction and other raider alliances, quite successfully. however, the status quo forces alliances who wish to hurt folks in a deeper, greater sense...to ultimately assume the same risk themselves."
"confusing question. i'm going to say yes, because even the biggest and best power should face defeat by a well-worked multiple front attack - they should face loss of holdings certainly. if the cost of war was properly represented in the 0.0 territorial game this would go a long way to breaking the static logjam that plagues the pvp endgame in eve at the moment.not worried at all. outposts are far cheaper and far easier to build and defend than they were in the initial roll-out. + for all the bluster i honestly don't believe that alliance officers will (or could) commit to large scale outpost destruction \"for the lulz\". when a power has been through the hassles of pos warfare required to take these things they will find it hard to simply press the button and deny any potential renter/resale income form the outpost outside of particularly bitter feuds and significant wars. eve is isk rich today, the population increases, competitive pressure will ensure a steady pattern of outpost settlement. +the same mechanic that prevents wholescale pos destruction for the fun of it exists for outposts, you need to win a pos war, that means you need to deploy a cap fleet, that means you could be counter-dropped. cap fleets don't do anything \"for the lulz\". difficult to tell, and wars rarely work like that. it'll be the larger power vs the smaller power and its friends (or rivals of the larger power looking to gank capitals) - ultimately it takes pos work to gain sovereignty. in the current state of the game once the pos war is one the outpost will flip and the defenders have lost it forever (along with docking rights) potentially. with destructible outposts? well, in the example proposal in the op defenders would have recapture possibility if it was being self-destructed and if it was blown at least they'd have access to their hangers. plus of course, while the large side is committing to bully a smaller neighbour - whats happening to its own outpost systems - are its rivals moving to take advantage? if i cared only about maintaining my own \"advantage\" and nothing about the general health of the 0.0 game in general i'd be utterly against this - it will shake up the status quo and lead to many more exciting and costly wars. if i was counting on stability and a quiet life this would be the worst idea ever. if on the other hand i ran such an alliance and cared more about war and space operatics and hurting my enemies significantly and wanting to change the landscape i'd be for it. i'd much rather play a part in a dynamic campaign setting than be fixed in amber."
"there are 63 unique characters in this thread. so less than 50% support. as for how many players, well, i can't say. however, well over 10% of the thumbs up come from sf members, and a fair chunk of the rest from roaming alliances with a vested interest. oh, and 2 goons taking the ****. discounting those 2 you're left with 28 supports from 63 characters. 44% support. in the \"democratic system\" that jade has sworn to uphold, that's a no. sounds high, but considering other threads have a 90% posts:thumbs ratio, that's pretty damned significant.still waiting for a response as to why granting the ability to project power without physical presence is a good thing"
"i have to disagree again. an attacker risks more isk in a single pos attack than the average outpost owner stakes in the destructible proposal in the op. lets be sensible about this garreck. at the moment to hurt an outpost owner you need to commit to a dreadnaught deployment and campaign of pos replacement to take away sovereignty to make the outpost vulnerable to conquest, then you need to garrison and hold the place and put up your own towers to keep it from being recaptured. that's a huge investment of time and effort and you only hurt your enemy while you are maintaining the conquest garrison. current situation is entirely slanted in favor of the defender, and the moreso since it is only possible for a raider power to hurt a territorial power if it ceases to be a raider power and adopts the defeated targets ideology.now, with the example i gave in the op. you still need to conquer the outpost. you still need to deploy all the dreads, you are still putting more isk value into harms way than the outpost owner does. only this time you have a light at the end of the tunnel - if you successfully siege and conquer the system and make the outpost vulnerable you have the chance to blow it up and make the defender pay a significant cost to balance out the significant risk you have taken in the deployment of capital and conventional ships and expense of your own pos. this represents a rebalancing of a current situation that is badly out of kilter garreck. but lets not be silly about relative risk and isk values."
"i'm going to have to disagree with your point here. i do not believe that the majority of people are intelligent. i also believe most of them will come to faulty conclusions."
"come on alex don't be silly. if you are going to play that game then one could just as easily say that a huge majority of the negative posts are from territorial alliance members with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. we also know how the system of support works here - many posts in the thread shows a robust and interesting discussion, the bigger the discussion the more interesting the issue is, but you aren't going to get away with dividing supports by discussion posts and coming up with funky numbers. we all know this one is a big issue and its an emotive one - it will hurt some 0.0 alliances if this ever came into the game, we all know this. some people love the idea, some people hate it. so don't act all surprised about it when the discussion attracts extremes of point of view and perspective."
"are all irrelevant. you said it yourself. eve is isk-rich. the only scarce resource is pilot time. to stop someone re-taking an outpost requires siginificant investment in terms of pilot time over a long period of real time. to stop someone re-taking an outpost via destruction of the outpost requires minimal time in terms of pilot time and real time.however, to re-secure that space to the point you could re-erect an outpost would take a much more significant amount of pilot and real time than it took to remove it. also, you'd have to do the re-securing and re-claiming of sov under the eyes of an enemy with an established strategic and industrial base, while you'd end up operating out of poses in deep space.how that increases \"combat dynamism\" i have no idea."
"yes, and they are. two of the main detractors in this case are cva and goonswarm. however, these two entities are probably two of the most well-versed entities in the galaxy in pos and territorial warfare. their opinion, while vested, is far more informed than many in this thread.that isn't what i did.correct. the small ones who currently rely on being too small to bother having their space taken. take an alliance at random, say, smash. fairly small, fairly low average sp, fairly typical bloated giant 0.0 ratting alliance. why do you think it has taken till now for someone to attack their space?"
"alex you are making points and asking questions that have nothing to do with the op post or proposals on the table. please calm down."
"...what?the risk v reward balance in terms of pilot time invested has nothing to do with outpost destruction? eh?"
"calm down. hahahaha coming from you."
"what i was getting at with #1 was that, as far as i'm concerned, the stronger party should win the war. not that they shouldn't get battered in the process, but at the end of the day they ought to be victorious, and if they don't there's likely something wrong with how the game is set up. this is mostly aimed at your suggestions about how this will make the game easier on smaller alliances - frankly, if smaller alliances want to play with the big boys, they'll get pounded into dust by them, and rightfully so. the best you can really hope for is switzerland - make yourself a tough enough nut to crack that they don't want to invade, since you'll never stop them if they really want to. but they shouldn't be able to win - the star fraction should not be able to take the fight to bob unsupported and do bugger all*. your comments through this thread seem to indicate that you feel differently, and that worries me a little. *4th alliance tourney aside - artificially leveled playing fields don't count, no matter how much fun that match was to watch. re #2, if you don't believe goon's boasts about popping outposts \"for the lulz\", might i suggest you inquire at your local hulk dealership about their extended warranty offers? more seriously, do you not acknowledge the possibility of an outpost whose potential revenues are lower than the costs of defending it, and as such, where it is worthwhile to pop it instead of keeping it? as for cap fleets, that's rather irrelevant to your proposal, since you suggested self-destruct only. as such, destruction only comes at a point where you've won, the cap fleets are put away, and you have to decide whether to defend the space. i can't imagine that decision will inevitably be pro-defence. re #3, i'm aware that i oversimplified horribly. unfortunately, such is often required in the realm of thought experiments - the real(or \"real\") world is too complex for simple analysis. also, does it worry you that you've just said a destroyed outpost makes a better logistical base for the losing side than an intact one? that's a massive flaw - the defenders actually have a huge incentive to pop the outpost as soon as it even starts looking like it might fall, because it shortens their supply lines for after it falls. that's a really big problem. re #4, that was pretty much the answer i was expecting - not like you could really have said anything else and maintained your plausibility here. i'm still curious about how you'd justify it to the members, though - \"yeah, you know the outpost you guys just spent a few thousand man-hours mining and building? i'm just going to go ahead and make sure our enemies can take it away from us more easily\". i'd love to see the corp mail after that one."
"and it doesn't take a long time to shoot pos shields down now? seriously, stop acting like outpost establishment is a big deal in the effort stakes. it really isn't any more. takes far more effort to successfully siege a system against opposition than it does to establish an outpost in the current state of the game.but like i said, please calm down. have a re-read of the op post and if you want to address those points feel free. but lets leave all the nonsense partisan politics and accusations of bias and csm faulty procedure at the door okay? we're all biased, your biased, i'm biased, the goons are biased, cva is biased, if we weren't biased we'd probably not care. so accusing this stuff is pretty pointless."
"another really good way of rewording what i'm trying to get at. this is about so much more than up-front, on-paper isk risk."
"it takes 10 minutes per pos. it's not the significant part of the fighting. that's the fight over the cyno jammer. once that is down it comes down to who has pilot superiority. fighting over capitals once the jammer is down is incredibly rare. we've seen it maybe 2 or 3 times out of the dozens of outposts that have changed hands.showing your inexperience here jade....do you know why it is so much easier to deploy an outpost in the current state of the game? sovereignty tools. you can jump a freighter in complete safety straight to its destination. you'll note the key part of re-constructing an outpost after destruction is the fact you have no industrial or strategic infrastructure.how do you propose they build an outpost with such ease without access to sovereignty tools? jump freighters can't carry an egg. you'd need to deploy a titan, or run freighter convoys through hostile space. either way you're putting disproportionate assets at risk to the effort your attacker put into removing your infrastructure. and all the while they've probably got a jump net right across the region.this is also discounting the time it takes to ship the parts to a single factory and construct the egg, which is pretty significant, parts total 20x the volume of the egg iirc.i haven't accused anyone of anything.but yeah, good job responding to my points again instead of just posting meaningless rhetoric and implying i'm an idiot ohwait."
"there is \"winning\" and there is \"inflicting damage\". nobody is saying that a small power should be able to win a war automatically against a larger power, but there should be cost for both sides and if they get involved in asymmetrical offenses its entirely reasonable that some outposts get burned for both parties before the war concludes with the expected consequence. yep of course, or maybe it gets ransomed back to the original owners. maybe we get to see a renaissance of 0.0 piracy with pandemic and friends flying round the map and conquering outposts and threatening to blow them up unless the original owners pay a bribe. harsh, scary, but definitely eve. my point was that to get to the stage where you can self-destruct you need to take sovereignty and that takes cap fleets, that means deploying cap fleets against the small alliance and taking on all the risk that entails of one of your other enemies hot dropping you at the pos while you are taking the system. well they pay a price for it, and i'm not envisaging corporate hangers and fitting tools, literally the hanger is a giant can and you can lever stuff out of your hanger to a cargo bay or dock with a ship from a pod. its not exactly optimal and the attacker still gets to deploy large bubbles and camp the place. but i guess if you consider multi billion investment reasonable for a derelict super can base then fair enough. - does raise the question of what happens if the other side decides to rebuild the derelict at a discount with a new outpost though ... thats something i haven't thought of well i guess our goon delegates are going to have that experience with titans soon. serious point is - there is personal advantage in game, and there is \"the good of the game.\" i want to be successful with my character in game sure - but if the game itself dies then whats the point of that success? eve needs to be thriving to truly keep my interest. i can't think of anything more sad than to be ruler of a pos empire in a declining eve that is dying because the 0.0 game is just too static for anyone to enjoy."
"...what?there are more alliances in the game now than ever before. there are more younger pilots in 0.0, there are more older pilots in 0.0, 0.0 space has actual worth through its moons. it's more populated and has more fights than ever before. from day to day nano***gotry, to the recent 50 cap death a day fights up north between nc and insrg. space ownership has swung around so many times in the last months it's nigh on impossible to track. the west is full of neutral entities, not one but two northern superpowers collapsed, the east fractured and splintered and the south is gearing up for another epic confrontation.how on earth is this game dying? it's only as dead as you choose to make it. the magic of that sandbox you hold so dear."
"lets see if you actually respond to points raised if i remove the point questioning your experience on an issue, as it actually relates to what your saying and whilst your choice to ignore it is unsuprising, its hardly how a csm rep should act. instead of complaining about bias and refusing to answer points that question your experience and position to talk about these issues, try actually debating the issue if you want to follow the actual csm rules.when outposts were introduced and soverignty was introduced based on pos warfare, how long did it take to destroy a single pos? how many capital ships were around, how many dreadnaughts were around? they were a limited factor designed to help pos warfare.now, it is possible for 100 dreadnaughts to be fielded against a pos. it is now faster and easier to destroy poses than ever before, and harder to defend against.to combat this and help alliances stop being steamrolled new mechanics were introduced. did this make living in 0.0 easier. possibly. were they intended to be used as an outpost buff? no, they were introduced to make pos warfare more managable.new features should not be looked at in stand alone situations. \"cyno jammers and jumpbridges make logistics easier\". lets remove them shall we. we now have a system where dozens of dreadnaughts enter a system at will, reinforce all towers in very feasibly under an hour, to reinforce as many poses as seige cycle allows. then 2 and a half days later, they return, and destroy those poses even faster (whats the record for a pos being destroyed out of reinforced, i believe its under 5 mins).so an alliance does this and next down time sov drops. lets look at the time scale on this, 3 days from initial suprise strike to sov dead.outposts have not changed, their value has not changed, the effort in putting one up may gotten easier but this is in balance to the effort neccessary to defend them. the mechanics surrounding their defence has changed in a response to the changing circumstances of the eve environment in which those mechanics apply.your argument is flawed becaused it is basing the argument to make outposts destroyable based on the development of pos warfare, which developed in a way which was neccessary, and although not neccesarily balanced, has not impeded 0.0 warfare to a great effect, in a way which was not intended to boost outposts.cyno jammers and jump bridges are not restricted to solely outpost systems, reliant upon the existance of an outpost. if they were, then i might just let you look at outposts in relation to these mechanics in isolation to the rest of eve. however, just because you cannot drop 100 dreadnaughts and destroy a system, does not mean that someone, or hell, even everyone else in 0.0 cant do that.give outposts defences, give them a major major major boost, i.e. 20 corp offices each, all services at a good quality and then you can trade off these boosts against it being utterly destroyable.what annoys me most about this is that you are looking at these mechanics and how they compare to other mechanics in isolation of the wider circumstances.simply answer this question: considering that outposts were given destructible station services which means they can be effectivly made useless which in essence for outposts was a nerf, in what way are outposts unbalanced and needing to be made destructable? how have they recieved any buffs that are not simply in response to another issue, where any bonus they recieve is a side issue of the bigger picture.when they were introduced they had a purpose, and have the exact same purpose today. they have not changed, you say they are cheaper in relative terms, how are they? just because time has gone on and people have made empires the way ccp intended, using the mechanics they intended to make living in the valuable parts of 0.0 profitable doesnt means things are any cheaper."
"you are going to have to read the context of the reply i made to another person rather than just snipping quotes and asking silly questions alex."
"it was in context. if you think it's out of context and the answer is the game isn't dying - then why the need to revitalise it?more to the point, what logic have you used to come to the assumption that removal of infrastructure will give a more \"vibrant\" 0.0? surely it'd mean 0.0 can support fewer pilots, giving a much more dull game.oh, and you still havent explained how the ability to deny space without physical presence is a good thing.still haven't replied to hardin either, just sayin'."
"destructible station services is largely a joke. nothing that can be done in a reasonable timescale by anything other than a full pos sieging gang. outposts are unbalanced because they cannot be destroyed. its that simple. everything else in eve 0.0 can be. outposts can't. now perhaps you can tell me in return why an outpost should be the exception to the rule given that players are currently flying and risking super capital ships that represent far more isk investment and construction difficulty every night in eve? everyone has more money, 0.0 especially. the cost in real terms is much lower. the cost in effort is much lower. there are significant infrastructure advantages that make outpost establishment today much easier."
"again with the isk... it's been established that it's not relevent, in your own words from this very post \"everyone has more money, 0.0 especially.\". the amounts of isk here are irrelevant. the only things involved are pilot time and strategic impact. the strategic impact of supercapitals is negligable. i can't operate an alliance to the point of dominating a region from a mothership, and a titan isn't much better. while they're comparable isk wise, they're nowhere near the same league in terms of strategic mechanics.oh, and constructing a supercap is alot easier than constructing an outpost, i can tell you that. outpost requires managing a system of poses, construction of the egg (20m m3 of mats) and all the other construction materials. supercap is mostly just hauling components to a spot and hitting the button, that is unless its you're first time. but then who hasnt built supercaps these days?and how does one gain access to these infrastructure advantages when, say, goonswarm has just rolled through your space with scorched earth set to 1?"
"same reason they didn't emulate restricted docking in the fw model, presumably they are making this decision informed by the experience of 0.0 and with an eye on enhancing the 0.0 experience. the vision of eve four years ago and the real eve today are very different, ccp has grown more pragmatic and interested in preserving a threshold of basic playability rather than committing to some rhetoric of harshness that is largely untapped and exhausting--see 0.0 roaming and all pos gameplay. i'm all for more concrete victory conditions but i suspect the real effect of this is unpredictable. doing away with that in the form of destructible outposts seems like it serve more rhetorical interests than it would genuinely enhance gameplay at the sovereignty and territorial level especially when alliance spies can more or less undermine pos and sovereignty within existing gameplay mechanics."
"you might be right. so lets ask them. then we can settle the matter of this discussion and get on with other topics."
"a) not really. unless you believe that making it harder for smaller alliances to gain footholds and become powers will somehow increase the amount of times that lines are redrawnb) plenty would be fewer than there are now.besides pos, fuel, guns, capitals, time, effort, planning. yea, that is \"nothing\".except there is no mechanic by which we can capture pos. imagine if you could capture pos. when conquering a region you wouldn't have to put your own infrastructure down. it would be a lot easier and the only expenditures would be in time, effort, and possibly capitals. it would be easier to attack a region.but in the end, pos are not nearly comparable to stations, they have no personal hangars, they are not buffered by a siege, they offer no repair facilities and no true sanctuary from enemies. you can not easily manage fititngs, ships, and assets. you cannot trade materials, there are no contracts, no market, no offices, no clones.... you cannot only have one in a system.it might make sense if pos were that type of asset, but they aren't and no comparison to their destructibility and inability to be captured can be made.no, it may not be reached. whether or not it is reached is determined by the ralative power of the institutions which it borders. but even if it is reached it will be reached later and less often. its a matter of risk and reward and you reduce the reward and increases the risk. this doesn't produce more action to make sov change hands it produces less.because an outpost is an operational goal and a pos is a strategic goal. just as we don't have the ability to destroy dyspro moons. the static resources give structure and goals to be achieved.capital ships are not captureable operational goals. they are tactical goals. something you must remove in the way to achieve strategic and operational goals.if they burn the rest there is even less space and less valuable space. the little guy thrives by keeping these less valuable spaces as it grows in power. fewer places to go the more often they are out on their ass. your argument is akin to saying \"we should get rid of the homeless shelter because it sucks to be homeless\""
"or, let's not and let's ask them about far more pressing issues. say, for example the removal of 30/90d gtcs, or the abandonment of the api development, or the gashtastic ui, or the constant prevalance of desync, or the seeming lack of accountability for gms, or the absolute lack of working bounty system, or the constant disparity of speed, or the sub-par nature of minmatar battleships, or the farmer infestation of empire, or the imbalance between mission and ratting rewards, or the fact cloakers are still invulnerable or maybe even cyno jammers.so there's a round dozen issues that are all far more important and far more pressing than your personal crusade against territory holders. you'd be failing in your role as a csm member to present this petty crap before those other issues.and also, still haven't responded to the questions i posed pages ago. why is it that you want to implement a system that will allow effective denial of control of space (as important as control of space) without a physical presence. despite the fact you're opposed to people exerting influence across the game without pilots there."
"you may try to twist my words in whatever way you like. my track record is actually for the little guy. the 5 man corp that wants to try 0.0. the individual who wants to mine. the 30 players wanting pvp. i want others to thrive. exploding outposts is bad for everyone save except those who do not want space. we have demonstrated through all methods available why this is so. the groups most capable of such path have said we are right. continue the personal agenda if you must, but at least answer the challenges. you are failing to defend your position against valid points.and you know what? even if you swindle enough csm into the proposition we will still take our case right to ccp. current mechanics do not support this idea. it is bad for every catagory of player except those wishing to impact 0.0 without investing in it. that is the bottom line and it will be realized."
"no, what your failing to see is that yes is everything in eve is losable (not neccesarily destructable). outposts do not in themselves provide the ability to attack and destroy your enemy. super caps are offensive tools, and can be used to kill other players. outposts cant, they can barely even be called a defensive mechanism as once they are deployed you can still lose them based on mechanics that have nothing to do with outposts. as i have said before, i have nothing against destructible outposts being introducted. people will have the ability to make an informed decision based on whether they want to deploy them on that basis. but outposts in their current form should not be destroyable because you are essentially talking about undermining hundreds of billions of isk investment in unmovable assets which require hundreds of man hours to build and even more to defend and in maintanence. ccp has never made a decision which can affect the player base on such a massive scale.and i dont see your point with isk. everyone has more isk? i dont, my wallet is consistently under 300mil. what your saying is that due to the investment made earlier on its now easier for entities in deeper 0.0 to make isk easier (though still not in a safe way, well apart from dyspro and prom moons). outposts still require a major investment, and by your logic it means that the more isk people have the more expensive outposts get to build. well if that were the case then people would complain \"why should they pay less for the same thing\". people build on what they invest, its how life works. just because they have put their own isk forward and put in the effort doesnt mean you should undermine their value now.you mentioned outposts have recieved over a dozen buffs in an earlier post, please can you list some of these with a reason why they were introduced as an outpost buff.and furthermore have you even considered how easy it will be to destroy outposts under your system. you can with relative ease destroy an outpost in under a week. especially if your other suggestions put forward in your manifesto come to the fore (which i somehow think they will).what really matters is what is eve? should it remain what it is now or will it become something where it is impossible to make a tangible effort to build up your own territory, and simply became a \"destroy everything that everyone has\" game. thats an issue that should be raised, what is the future of eve. if you want to destroy the very essence of eve then what your suggesting is a good way to go."
"in my opinion the cons outweight the pros 90-10 on this issue. i can't support an idea that will make it harder for the little alliances to get their own space in 0.0."
"when outposts were first introduced it struck me as odd that they weren't destructible. i support giving the players the choice to destroy the outpost. i also support giving alliances the choice to self-destruct the outpost as well.for all those saying it will be worse for little alliances. if you truly believe little alliances should be able to compete with larger alliances than sure this change would actually be bad but implementing this change and then other changes to correct the \"problem\" of small alliances competing with larger alliances is the best direction to take."
"look at the op, jade gave that system as an example only, not as a fixed and final consideration of how outposts should die.the distilled question is this, should players be able to construct things that cannot be de-constructed no matter who later controls them?outposts are merely one facet (though a large one) of that question. if ccp were to consider that yes all player constructable items must be destructible in keeping with the sandbox principle, then, what sort of balancing that would be needed to take place in order for it to be reasonable that outposts could be destroyed, given the costs and efforts of construction, would need to be thrashed out in detail."
"a) doesn't necessary follow. allowing player built infrastructure to be destroyed will not automatically prevent smaller alliances from gaining footholds. the fact that something is destructible does not ipso facto result in it's destruction. it will be more difficult in some but not all cases and i don't think that this is necessarily a bad thing anyway.b) how? allowing outposts to be destructible would not shut down entire regions where pre-exisiting npc built controllable structures still exist.goons or bob or [insert favourite large villainous alliance] crushing alliances nearby to their controlled space would not empty out syndicate or other alliance nurseries. if anything it would simply ensure that those who do move out to the now empty regions would need a greater degree of preparedness than they do today and that the new breed of alliances would probably be a tougher existential challenge to the sprawling existing powers than is currently the case."
"yes it does necessarily follow. here is one example of how it must necessarily follow; any station that is destroyed will increase the value of all other stations. more value means more competition. more competition means costs increase. costs increase means its harder for smaller alliances to gain footholds. just as in any situation when competition forces out the inefficient its the small that get pushed out first unless there is some major failure in a larger system[see: triumvirate]here is a second way:its to the benefit of large alliances to consolidate space and remove stations, which are strong logistical tools, near their space. stations facilitate player activity and player activity is the main thing that allows alliances to push into areas where another entity is over-extended(or well any push at all). this scenario is not beneficial to the larger alliances, especially since density is an advantage for alliances. such, currently its in an alliances interest to hold as much space as possible to create a buffer that must be sieged through(or set with friendlies/pets). if alliances can instead remove the infrastructure that buffer becomes even better.power is a zero sum game, and so anything that increases the power of the larger alliances by giving them better and larger buffer zones must necessarily reduce the power of smaller alliances who do not have that advantage and must overcome it.to put it simply. rational play on the part of large alliances mean that if a small party wants to get into the game they have to build their own station.irrelevant. what is relevant is that the number of possible nurseries increases. lets imagine for a second that we could destroy stations for the past year. if this were true, fountain would have been purged of stations as well as geminate. why am i mentioning fountain and geminate. well, instead of smash/rk/atlas trying to make their way in geminate they would have tried it in syndicate. bruce would have been unable to move into fountain in the wake of one of bobs pets failing and would still be in syndicate. now instead of alliances growing in alliance nurseries we have alliances competing for the ability to grow in nurseries. this reduces the ability of those alliances to compete against the larger(and again, as above, more powerful) established alliances.less nurseries is still less nurseries, whether or not you think its \"plenty\". and less nurseries mean less alliances getting to the point where they might be able to make a move. less alliances getting to the point where they might be able to make a move against established alliance means more stagnation."
"an interesting read."
"actually ikar what i'm failing to see is your answer to my question. i answered all the questions you asked - i asked one question in return, it would be simple politeness for you to reply. your alliance does though. your individual wallet is irrelevant to this discussion. incorrect, i'm saying that since alliances have much more isk available and establishing outposts is a less significant effort today its reasonable to increase the risk of their use.i'm proposing a rough example where you need to take sovereignty in order to conquer a outpost and rather than holding that outpost you have the option to initiate a self destruct after x period.same straw man argument repeated many many times through the course of this (and every other discussion between outpost holders and would be outpost attackers) on the issue. it is certainly not established that destructible outposts would make it \"impossible\" to build up territory. i understand its a convenience \"scare tactic\" to filibuster the debate, but really, neither the proposal on the table (nor the example resolution) support this rather extreme conclusion. at some point we have to accept that ccp will take a look at the problem with 0.0 warfare and make a decision on whether its currently too hard to actually impact existing 0.0 alliances and whether this is good or bad for the future of the game.i got elected in first place in a popular election on a platform of promising to ask ccp about the introduction of 0.0 outposts ikar. i'd like to do that. thats what this thread is about."
"as far as i can see of this thread pezzle all counter arguments have been answered in a robust and engaging discussion. the fact you may not like the answers doesn't mean they haven't been answered and offered to you. don't you think the word swindle is a bit ridiculous in this context? lets look at the result of the popular vote in the recent election. hardin and i came top of the polls, he is resolutely status quo on the issue of outposts, i'm arguing for re-balance and dynamic consequence. i topped him by 43 votes (yep thats tiny) but it represents the fact that the informed and passionate voting community is split 50/50 on this issue and the way to handle such splits is not to muzzle and stifle the debate by refusing point-blank to have it on the agenda. it would be very silly to disenfranchise a large slice of the voting electorate by stopping this question being raised at the csm level. lets table the question and ask the question. i phrased the question in the op in a particular way, i would like to hear the answer to that question from ccp so i can report the outcome to the community. if they don't see a role for destructible outposts in 0.0 then fair enough, i'm not going to sulk or stamp my feet about it, but its a question that needs to be asked and attempting to prevent the asking of that question when thousands of players have voted for a candidate advocating that question is short-sighted and pretty anti-democratic."
"guo, i don't see how increasing the value and consequently the competition for something like an outpost makes it more likely that the borders around it will change only once unless they are forced back to the previous state by other great powers.i may be being dense, but i really need a better explanation for that because i think what you are saying does not make sense. if anything it should make outposts continuous sources of friction. even more so if destruction leaves a shell that can be rebuilt at a lower cost than a new build.second point you seem to be agreeing with me by disagreeing with me :si said 'if anything it would simply ensure that those who do move out to the now empty regions would need a greater degree of preparedness than they do today and that the new breed of alliances would probably be a tougher existential challenge to the sprawling existing powers than is currently the case.' which is not to dissimilar to the point you made though we seem to disagree about whether this is a good or bad thing i suppose.and what's more i think to the extent it would be a problem would only be due to the huge standing advantage that presently existing power blocs have and time and combat would erode that or the larger powers would continue to earn their place versus the upstarts. the temptation to use one's ability to cut a swath through the existing regional infrastructure could be balanced by having a very high cost attached to taking such a path, by implementing costs such as those hardin has suggested. then regional destruction operations might come at such a high price that engaging in them could in itself pose a real problem."
"all this blubbering about small space holding alliances is a load of bull****. goum knows it, too.there are no small independant space holding alliances. they do not exist, because they cannot exist. if they do, provide an example. as i have said before the closest you get are in the utter arse-end of 0.0, and no one else wants it. destructable outposts will have obsolutely zero effect on whether a small alliance can or can't take space and hold on to it. the entire argument is bull****."
"though i've already handled hardin's arguments comprehensively in the chatsubo thread on the same issue i'll give a brief rebuttal here for the record too: potted answer to hardin: 1) they are not really an issue (we have more important things to discuss)disagree, balance in 0.0 is a very important issue, and one of the most critical issues in end-game content at the moment. this thread for example is the biggest and most interesting 0.0 gameplay issue thread in the assembly hall, and the issue of destructible outposts attracted a huge amount of discussion and commentary during the election campaign.2) it will not enhance the gamedisagree; it will definitely enhance the game by introducing more options for the disposal of conquered territory. options for ransoming outposts, exciting new conflict opportunities in nail-biting countdown battles, large wars will have large losses, dramatic scorched earth retreats, and critical showdowns at hqs. these are all enhancements to the drama and beauty of eve.3) it completely ignores the risk vs reward balancedisagree; it still costs more isk on the line to siege a defended outpost system than it does to establish an outpost. + with the example on the table its the outpost itself that is under hazard, not the contents of player hangers. game time (read grind time) is not a good measure of balance. we shouldnt be balancing the game by promoting the defence advantage of boring activities  thats just bad design.4) it will increase barriers to 0.0 usedisagree; and i would say the opposite. bringing real consequence to war for territorial holders will make them reduce their borders and concentrate defence. a new alliance with a single outpost will find it easier to hold since existing predatory powers will need to take their own defence far more seriously than at present. contraction in the safe zones and defensible holdings of over-extended powers makes for more debatable space that new powers can colonize and since the buy in for an outpost at the moment is less than the buy in for a properly fitted mothership we'd see a lot of this happening. arguably it would be worth even conflict orientated powers putting up destructible outposts simply to \"get fights\" - would certainly make for some excellent fleet battles around the self-destruction cycle countdowns.5) it will reduce pvpdisagree; it will increase pvp around the contested stations because there are more options for the victor. at the moment it makes a lot of sense for outmatched defenders to simply go away and come back later and just retake a lost outpost when boredom takes the wind from the aggressor. with increased victory options for attackers the defenders will need to take defence more seriously since there is more at stake. currently indestructible outposts are a disincentive to pvp because frankly - why bother unless you intend to take the space yourself? nothing is achieved by the process of sieging an outpost system unless you undertake to hold it long term. significant portions of the 0.0 pvp community have opted out precisely because of this. 6) it damages the 'history' of evedisagree; and since the example being proposed has outposts being rendered down to permanent derelicts (with names) and which could be rebuilt again at a discount by a power so moved to do so, this history is preserved. adding \"reduced by x power at y time\" \"rebuilt by x power at y time\" would add to history not remove it. i think you can see that each and every point is fairly easily contested from the other side of the argument. reality is that we all have ingrained bias and interest in this matter - the territorial outpost powers have become reliant on the indestructible nature of outposts. the roving pvp, raiding powers have become frustrated by the inability to cause lasting harm without changing their playstyle. its no surprise its a passionate debate."
"this is why i'm starting to worry about your outlook here. what exactly should they be destructible by, in your mind? it seems reasonable to me that outposts should be harder to kill than poses, but you're saying you need \"a full pos sieging gang\" like it's a bad thing. what should be able to offline an outpost, in your mind?"
"well i'm not entirely sure the idea of vulnerable outpost facilities was a very good one in the first place is the simple answer. damage required was always going to be either so much it rules out meaningful impact from smallish gangs (and here i'm going to cite my 30 ship tech2 rr battleship force that i once tried to hit station services with and decided not to be bother after seeing the ridiculous amount of time it would take to achieve anything) or so small that anyone could do it and the services could be kept pretty much permanently down by dedicated small gang operators. point is if you have a full pos sieging gang why would you want to be shooting down services when you could be sieging pos? (since at least that way you could be inflicting lasting fiscal damage) - things might be different if it cost isk to run capital rr armour reps but thats another story but this is aside from the point really. if you had to ask me to choose between offlining station services and indestructible tag - i'd go with with sorting out the latter. i think there is balance in allowing a force that conquers a outpost through coventional means being able to set self destruct after x period of time and trade its advantage in victory for meaningful damage on the foe."
"its a joke because we have to mount all that metal to take out a \"station service\" that isnt lasting fiscal damage."
"1) outposts should be destructible2) there should be limits on how much space a larger blob can defend but that's quite a different discussion"
"how come when there is a silly topic under discussion we can put a symbol for support but not for disagreement?disagree!this is just a whine from the don't haves that others shouldn't. as every sensible person can see this would result in the larger alliances wiping out the smaller ones and prevent any new empires building."
"nice that the leader of a large and established outpost owning alliance can so easily dismiss the gameplay aspirations and interests of a large portion of the 0.0 player base aralis. but there are people out there would like to destroy outposts to inflict lasting fiscal damage on their war enemies through actual hardcore pvp battles and showdowns without being forced through the same hoops and fixed territorial pve paradigms in the aftermath to make the results \"stick\" - this is about options, its about open pvp and its about the most dangerous areas of eve actually being dangerous. this is not about making it \"easy\" to destroy outposts - its about making it \"possible\".you might be able to justify diminishing the interests and gameplay desires of thousands of eve players in roving pvp alliances/corporations/pirate outfits and mercenary groups in a throwaway pat phrase about \"whining\" aralis. i think its unwise and hence i would like to ask ccp the question in the op.i think we've established the partisan lines on the issue. silly posts about \"whining\" add nothing to the quality of debate at this point."
"just to throw a curveball into this idea:thoughts on the ability to dismantle a captured outpost for parts/materials? similar to the way a destroyed/offlined pos's modules can be looted?actually even if it's the original builder, they might want to disassemble and reassemble somewhere else if fortunes change and they need to pull up stakes and move somewhere else.it's not as flashy as a self-destruct..."
"i can only show my support for this.(note: i didn't read the full thread)eve is a brutal game, anything that corrodes this should be considered as a candidate for change and i believe indestructible permanent assets need to be considered.as a sidenote, recent wars would've been very different if the defenders could use scorched earth tactics or if attackers could leave behind husks of outposts instead of having to secure another area."
"if the alliance that takes over the outpost invests as much isk in blowing it up and shows that they can hold it for 30-60 days i think this would be a more reasonable argument. as it stands now there is no extra investment in eliminating a 30 billion isk asset (and months of work) required and 72 hours is comical.jade why dont you support the conquering alliance actually having to commit real resources and invest real time in holding the asset before they can blow it up? your solution seems customed designed for griefing. blitzkrieg the space, take the outpost, lock it down for three downtimes and blow it up. hard to envision a system more built for griefing. and interestingly enough your corp mates are on record calling for changes to sov. to make it actually easier to take sov. from the holding alliance.so if we combine jade's current \"lets blow up outposts in 72 hours\" with jade and his corpmates calls for \"making it easier to take sov-removing pos's from sov equation\" posts. we have a bit of a trend here. jade fraction is doing everything it can through jade's unforunate term on the csm and his corpmates vigorous support for other <issues> to break sov and break outpost holding.i dont think jade's agenda should be looked at in isolation. it must be looked at in totality. there is a steady march toward eliminating empire building, outpost building, region building in 0.0. jade's play style doesnt match it, and his alliances repeated failures to make an impact in the grand political stage have led to this frustration. i ask you to take a peak at the chatsubo forums. over the past two years-after each jade fraction failure-you will see a manifesto emerge from jade regarding how broken eve is. most of these were either debated out of fun or ignored-as after all it is jade. however now..we have him as csm chair. admitting in this post that he will take his issues to ccp regardless of votes, regardless of process...look into the man's history before you support his propoganda.and despite how you chose to spin it jade-it is about you. you indicated in this very thread that you got elected on this platform and you will take this issue to ccp. so as painful as it is..we have to focus on you and your motives as you have stated on several occasions that your term on the csm is designed to foster your agenda and not the will of the players in eve."
"i think, jade, that aralis is at least as entitled to his opinion (and that the opinion is every bit as relevant to be posted here) as your opinion that a stunning 36 supports in a 10 page discussion somehow constitutes something that \"thousands\" of folks are interested in seeing come to fruition.i mean, if we're gonna blur the issues by attacking statements and argument presentation, yeah?"
"is the ratio of supports:posts really relevant considering nearly the entirety of the opposition is a handful of cva posters? i don't think you want to go down that line of argument - better to stick to the merits of the issue itself."
"apparently it doesnt matter. jade has indicated that he wants to and will take this to ccp regardless of support. he seems to believe that since this was a part of his platform and since he received x number of votes it is both his right and mandate to carry his specific election agenda to ccp.i suppose we could eliminate this and all other <issue> threads and run the council based on jade's overwhelming mandate to carry forth his election platform to ccp. i do believe, as evidenced by his own words, that jade believes this to be the proper course.and if we eliminate jade fraction votes..well..."
"nice to see the leader of an established alliance with no interest or experience in 0.0 ownership or development so easily dismiss aspirations and interests of a large portion the of the 0.0 player base jade.we have stated other issues are more important and should be considered before this issue. we have offered examples. members of large alliances that live in 0.0 have said this is a bad idea and explained why. the best defense you can muster is essentially 'it might not happen'. what a startling analysis. that certainly trumps others saying 'yeah we would have done that last week actually.' groups will destroy outposts that are inconvenient because it is easier than the alternatives. this is a powerful tool to reinforce the status quo. 0.0 markets will not grow. 0.0 populations will shrink. power blocks will still remain and have even greater power. let's be honest, this is your issue. three days after you posted the issue and with what? 16 yes votes and some no you decided to put it on the agenda. this is not counterstrike. you should not have the right to mess with the board if you do not play the game. how you can fail to see this smashing the chances of groups not already well established is beyond me. i think you do see that, but there is no downside to the issue for you, so you do not care. in eve you must be commit to succeed. i will give you an example. i could make money running missions but i find it boring. i get bored shooting npcs. i do not mine or manufacture much. i am not a market trader. i could be rich, but because of my unwillingness to spend the time on these activities i remain poor. this does not mean i should lobby ccp for new and easy ways to make me rich to the detriment of others who are willing to do what it takes. destroying outposts will leave a wasteland. maybe your idea of 0.0 is a near vacant expanse with few encounters outside a few strongholds where warlords muster forces but others have a different view. empire building. growth, progress, conflict. destroying outposts will hasten stagnation. end of story."
"quoting for fail.let's have a look at the opposition (defined as anyone that's posted against this proposal), in order, from page one.goumindong (goonswarm)drago vanguard (vanguard corporation)ethaet (aliastra; npc corp)yorda (goonswarm; later retracted, in favor of griefing)pezzle (cva)rodj blake (pie)tarminic (black flame industries; likes idea, but not implementation)rakshasa taisab (ursa stellar initiative)sencnes (rebellion against big irreversible dinks)alex shurk (not listed)procurement specialist (not listed; goon alt, in favor of griefing)waterfowl democracy (goonswarm)allaria kriss (elipse; sadly not one of the more erudite opposition members!)natalia kovac (sebiestor tribe; npc corp)hugh ruka (exploratio et industria morispatia)telxkiskisrowr (goonswarm)merouk baas {not listed)tycho straun (not listed; actually more of a neutral)herschel yamamoto (bloodmoney incorporated; alternatively supports and opposes various parts)brmble (goonswarm)hardin (cva; csm representative)vantras (cva)garreck (cva)ikar kaltin (cva)volir (deep space hvac)reash (cva)ivor gunn (no one expects the spanish inquisition)maidel (cva)moon kitten (goonswarm)elmicker (wreckless abandon; more of a personal attack than an opposition)erotic irony (0bsession)mrzyd (not listed)aralis (cva)lot of cva, lot of goons, but hardly all cva and hardly just a few - i count 33, and that's almost the same as the number of people you have in favor! even if you take out the 5 questionable cases, you still have 28 people who are clearly opposed and have argued as such. pretty significant if you ask me, since it's easier to post /signed and click a checkbox than it is to make a credible case against a proposal."
"well pezzle if you combine the destroy outposts agenda item with the make sov. much easier to break..you begin to see where jade is coming from. what jade fraction could never do on the battlefield (a record of repeated failures is available on various campaign threads) he is attempting to do with his role as csm chair.one way or another this is an attempt to make 200 roaming nano pilots somehow as relevant as 5,000 folks who have committed years and 100's of billions of isk to a region. what cannot and should not be doable on the battlefield jade is attempting to alter from a mechanics perspective. we have all watched this position evolve over the years-its just a bit more obvious as he force feeds unpopular and poorly thought out agenda items into the csm/ccp process.stand by for the \"speeding up nano-ships my fight for the little guy\" <issue> followed by \"cloaking-why it needs to be buffed-fairness on the battlefield for all\" ."
"hello. 500 man space holding non-aligned alliance reporting in.correct, we're in the arse-end of 0.0, cloud ring. bob to the south of us ra/iron to the north. either of those entities could probably take our space, but they probably aren't going to try because there is no reason to overextend their forces securing another region.if they could blow up our outposts, they wouldn't have to secure another region. they'd simply move in for a week, blow up the outposts, then move out.in effect, destroying the outposts does the same thing to your enemies as holding them does under current mechanics, except without the requirement of force/logistical commitment. how anyone comes to the conclusion that is balanced, fair or \"vibrant\" for the game, i'm quite curious to know, because so far it has perplexed me."
"so to paraphrase garreck: a stunning 28 oppositions in a 10 page discussion."
"goes both ways, but oppositions are far more significant due to the need for reasoning and the lack of a tick-box poll swayed by alts. i believe someone posted earlier there's only 60 unique characters in this thread, so to attain less than 30 real supports (once you've discounted goons) isn't really that good.however, it really shouldnt be brought into the discussion. all that matters is whether it's a good idea (it isn't) and whether the rest of the csm think jade has the mandate to take this further, which, going by the stats posted earlier, he doesn't.it's also surprising to me that some of the most vocal opposition to this is coming from goonswarm, they'd certainly have the most to gain from this scenario. lower delve, pb, and q would all be absolutely bare of stations right now, and bob would be wasting an ungodly amount of time rebuilding them."
"this is a terrible idea"
"precisely. it's a special interest issue that passionately interests a fraction of a percentage of eve population. the change would effect everybody.is that what csm is really for? to push special interest items to ccp that are important to a vanishingly small number of players but that effect everybody?"
"after reading this thread i still haven't seen any solid reasoning as to how destructible outposts would promote or develop 0.0"
"and just to demonstrate how little support this topic really has, titan monster truckscurrently has the same number of yes votes."
"\"opposition is more significant than support\" is a pretty baseless and uncompelling statement. as i said earlier, going down this line of reasoning isn't going to clarify the issue of whether these questions should be asked of ccp. all it really does is highlight that outpost owners are sensitive about the possibility of their invulnerable assets exploding - which is a perfectly reasonable position to hold.the issue that is going before the csm is whether or not they will raise the issue of outposts indestructibility/destructibility before ccp.a compelling argument has yet to be raised as to why this question shouldn't be asked - the answer is still up to ccp."
"precisely what they have to do to actually conquer the system and make the outpost vulnerable to capture in the first place. can i ask you to explain what you are talking about when you say \"jade fraction\" by the way?"
"yep he is certainly entitled to an opinion. other people are entitled to discount that opinion if it lacks substantive debate and boils down to an unhelpful accusation of \"whining\"."
"bare in mind an awful lot of the oppositional posting is repetitious, hardin pretty much summarized the whole of the opposition argument in his posts i answered hardin in detailso a lot of a back and forth aside from this is simply restating points getting in partisan supports and cheers and whatnot. fine you think its a bad idea. i disagree (so do many other players). i'd like to ask ccp what they think.that doesn't surprise me in the least actually goons are in a very similar position to cva at present with being quite reliant on existing indestructible outpost mechanics to maintain their power in 0.0. goons have a huge amount to lose potentially if outposts could be lost. band of brothers would have a field day lets face it. goons and bob would be embroiled in a brutal grueling attrition-fest to the death and one side or the other is going to run out of isk and be completely slaughtered. it makes sense that a side who aren't confident about the outcomes of this kind of brutal warfare in 0.0 would be a little wary about the question on destructible outposts. outposts do not take an \"ungodly\" amount of time to build. and as i've said to earlier posters - i completely discount this \"sky-is-falling-all-0.0-would-be-void-of-outposts\" canard for the reasons already stated through the discussion in this thread."
"holding my breath for a huge (and terrible post)^^^^^"
"yes. it's called \"democracy\". the rules of these sorts of processes are fairly simple, and fairly universal, in every democratic system i've looked at(and we're talking dozens of nations, here). the winning faction typically gets to implement their core platform with a fairly minor amount of opposition, and then everything after that is fair game. but the core platform is typically unmolested. the only exceptions to that i can think of are systems where there are multiple coequal elected branches of government, such as the us, where conflicting mandates lead to power clashes - see bush vs pelosi et al and clinton vs gingrich et al for the most notable examples."
"like i said, its an issue that attracts strong emotions because its a big decision and it would undoubtedly make life more difficult for the people currently used to indestructible outposts. hardin and i pretty much finished neck and neck in the csm elections on completely opposite viewpoints and aspirations for 0.0. he supports the status quo, i want big changes. he has a very substantial support group behind him, so do i. so its hardly surprising that this thread ends up being split down the middle pro and anti is it?ultimately though, its going to have stood as a discussion topic for the required seven days and we'll put it before the csm for voting. nobody can claim there hasn't been robust debate, nobody can claim it isn't a very important issue - based purely on the level of spirited and passionate discussion it is inspiring currently and in the election campaign itself."
"no, what i've quoted is baseless and uncompelling. to have a support counted, you simply need to post a contentless post and tick a ticky box. needs no thought and any character can do it. to oppose it, you need a constructive post with actual content (which will likely then be totally ignored).so, as a result, the statistics for the \"supports\" should be totally discounted. they're flawed, easily manipulated and have no basis in reasoning. therefore, the only valid analysis of this issue is one that goes point by point.the argument has been raised. several times. your judgement of the argument as not \"compelling\" (a term nearly as ambiguous as \"dynamism) does not invalidate the argument. the csm have a limited time and a limited mandate. let's take a quote from a recent dev blog.note that ccp have not committed to providing answers to every issue. so, to flood them with nonissues* such as this would be a failure on the part of the csm. this is the csm's first term. the priority should be going entirely to the important issues, the ones that have garnered multiple hundreds of supports without any coersion.*(yes, this is a nonissue, so far only 3 people have been posting in serious support of it, yourself, jade and dinique, all of whom have made their personal position towards territory holders perfectly clear.)if this goes in front of the council, it's simply a mockery of the csm. jade has come in, raised the issue, ignored multiple valid arguments against the issue and against the validity of the issue, and is simply going to raise it at council anyway. what exactly is the point of these forums when there is no obligation to actually follow their recommendations? i stand by my comments on shc that this entire thing is a farce that will get nothing done. bring on the third csm term when we've got unknowns on the council.aside from that, it's a terrible idea."
"you can ask jade, but with imitation being the best form of flattery, i will not answer.and...if you succeede in your other agenda item and reduce the \"cost\" of taking sov. that will decrease the cost. and assuming the system's are defended the cost to the attacker should be roughly the same as the defender in terms of ships lost. this still doesnt factor in the 30 billion isk and months of work to build and protect the station-never mind maintaining the post network, pos fuel etc. i understand, having never realistically attacked a station, built a pos, built a pos network, fueled a pos, defended a pos, defended a station, transported an egg, filled an egg, defended an egg, defended a region, patrolled a region, shuttled supplies to a region, held space, defended space, conquered space-that this stuff might be new to you. but please if you dont mind, as chairman and champion of wholesale changes to sov. and outposts please-please do some reading on how its done and the effort and expense required."
"and fwiw i dont see hardin supporting the status quo in his well reasoned response to your poorly reasoned topic. i can understand that it is important to paint this as a change vs. status quo issue but just stating it over and over doesnt make it so."
"but the way the debate is leaning at the moment is that it is only an 'important issue' because a small(ish) group of people are pushing a stupid idea really hard, and the larger community is trying to make sure it doesn't happen"
"i would not really call this a spirited debate. lots of examples of this being a bad idea. lots of the pro lobby ignoring anything that damages the credibility of the issue. a representative should be open to the possibility even their own ideas may be wrong, not closed. the pro lobby cannot consider themselves wrong. not a debate at all actually."
"i'm referring as much to anything as the election campaign and results. opposition in this thread is fairly limited to cva and goon interests, and as we've already come to understand - you guys are as biased on the issue as the roving pvp and raiding force players are. everyone is biased - partisan statements of loyalty to the cause have come to eclipse genuine debate in some quarters - but thats fine, its understandable, this is an emotive issue and it clearly divides the 0.0 player base roughly 50/50."
"disagree obviously, lots of good questions have come from neutral people here, those questions have been addressed. plenty of back and forth between the partisan camps also. you do need to step back a bit though pezzle and realize that just because you disagree with something it doesn't automatically make the opponent \"wrong\". i respect your point of view i really do, i see where you are coming from and can understand the issues you see with this and i can agree that this would make your gameplay more difficult and less secure if it ever did come to pass so i understand your emotion also. but i'm asking you to look beyond self-interest really and see the problems that exist with the static one-track 0.0 game. the results of the election should show if nothing else that with pro change and anti change candidates pretty much splitting the winning vote there are a lot of vocal people on both sides of this issue."
"again, what makes you think these two are exclusive? people don't sit in their outposts 23/7, they go out and kill things. they go and do roaming pvp and raid their opponents. they likely have the same experience in roaming pvp as you do.though, i'm curious as to what insights living as a roaming entity have given you that those who base from outposts do not have. really honest question there.second, just because someone may be biased does not make them incorrect. it simply makes their testimony less reliable. so far there has been very, very little testimony based on opinion. just about every bit of opposition i've seen so far (especially goum's economical analysis) has been based on empirical analysis. in such a case, bias makes no difference.60 players, most of whom have contributed nothing, and a fair number of whom are blatant alts, do not provide sufficient basis to make that statement. there are less than a dozen actual contributors to this thread, again not a sufficient sample. you'd do well to not state such baseless facts, it drags potentially legitimate arguments down.now, if you could do me one thing while you ignore the rest of my post.why does this issue deserve to be raised over other issues in the first term? what pressing concerns do you have that outpost saturation will become a problem, and more importantly what evidence do you have? what gives this issue more legitimacy than the 30/90d gtc topic, or the issue of nanoships, which afaik, has not yet been raised?"
"with respect elmicker you are not telling the truth here. i will direct you to my detailed rebuttal of hardin's summary of the anti argument: reply to hardin"
"i'm a neutral party - i live in empire and get by through industry. you've yet to answer the question i posed you on page 3, page 4, page 5, and well, just about every page since then.in my view, outpost destruction allows denial of space without physical occupation. why is this incorrect, or, why is this a good thing?"
"i wasn't referring to hardin. you've ignored my arguments (both my arguments why the proposals are crap and my arguments for why the issue shouldnt be raised even if the proposal were a good one), and i'm sure there's other quality posts you've ignored in favour of selectively responding to crappy alt posts."
"to be fair herschel, there weren't any stipulations like this in the csm document, so it would be unfair to the cva members in this thread to simply railroad something through on the basis of the idea submitter having won the election on the basis of this platform.however, the process for bringing issues to ccp is very clear - since an elected csm member supports this topic, there will be a vote by the council on whether to bring the issue on to ccp.if anyone has been reading the transcripts of the council sessions, they'll see that so far all issues have been moved on to the \"present to ccp\" phase because, to roughly paraphrase councilmember darius \"there's nothing wrong with talking about it\".now maybe i'm reading this wrong, but it seems like the consensus among the cva opposition is that there is something wrong with talking about it, and they think the debate should be stifled before it gets to ccp.i think it's great to talk about the merits of the idea itself, but given the track record of votes so far, you've got to make quite a case to argue that the csm shouldn't even talk about this with ccp."
"you really need to stop labeling people as pro-change and anti-change. just because people don't support your idea it does not mean they are against change, just this change."
"nice attempt to polarize us jade but you are wrong again. we (cva) have come out in vocal favor of the little guy time and again. the very function of the cva promotes new groups in 0.0. *edit* let me add that we come up with and support ideas that would make our lives more difficult. we also look at issues that do not impact on us and offer suggestions for others. concern for eve is more than just your pet project.we want well reasoned changes. we want to encourage growth, not atrophy. with growth comes the conflict. what we will not support is the eve 0.0 first person shooter objective this agenda is based on. change is good, but not all change. say whatever else you like, less people in 0.0 will not result in more conflict. the proposition would harm 0.0 growth and 0.0 pvp."
"are you actually aware of which issues have been raised so far? 30/90 gtcs is the first issue on the agenda? you can see a list of topics that have been discussed meeting 2 topicsyou can see this weeks topic meeting 3 topicsnanoships is clearly not an issue that people care about much since nobody has raised it. if you can see other issues on this assembly hall forum that are more important than the discussion of destructible outposts then your option is to go and get supporting them, go convince csm reps to advocate them. go get busy. but simply saying \"there are more important issues that haven't been addressed/made the agenda\" is not currently accurate."
"that implies there's actual debate. there's been a minimum of point-by-point responses from the \"yay let's blow up outposts\" camp, but a wealth of arguments, both general and point-by-point from the opposition.the csm have limited time, a mere 6 months. ccp are not obliged to respond to every proposal. as a result, long-term proposals such as this that would require significant research and investigation should be left until later terms, simply to allow pressing issues that genuinely concern players to get a proper response."
"4. feasibility of outposts going boom (jade)"
"i disapprove of jades idea/implimentation of destructable outposts.as vantras i can only see such an idea being viable if it puts a stiff cost for the attacker, both in investment and time.if its openeded with todays pos mechanics, it will reduce 0.0 into pre outpost wasteland fairly quickly. outpost griefing thru capital blobbage, and you will have a empty wasteland to show for it.even if outposts do present the owner of them some advantages (logistics) they also let neutrals/newbies/non pvp aligned players get familiar with 0.0 in a semi safe way as they can dock like in empire.take that away and you will be back to 0.0 filled with a whole lot of nothing.dead wasteland.so much for creating a sprawling world with identity and longlasting history."
"yes, i know. that's why i'm asking you what makes this as worthwhile as that topic?why should the csm and ccp spend their time discussing this when the only vocal support for this topic is coming from yourself, one of your corpmates, and dinique. all the other support posts have been contentless. the simple virtue of \"csm advocacy\" should not be enough. becuase that gives you carte blanche to put forward whatever tripe you feel like, while ignoring 11 pages of overwhelmingly negative feedback from multiple parties in multiple areas of the game.though, that link's nice. goum raises very good points. you do have a track record of consistently ignoring arguments (for example you've chosen my questioning of the point here and ignored my questioning of the proposal). and then your consistent track record of just ignoring people outright for things like \"swearing\" in an adult environment. if you were as mature as you're trying to make out, you'd simply ignore them, put down their arguments, then move on. it's a stupid strategy for the chair of a council to have, as you'll end up ignoring large amounts of good argument."
"ccp said that on every issue they'd either answer csm inquiries or explain why they couldn't, which is why they have a 7/14 day advance notice requirement on csm submissions. while respect for ccp's time is something we should be mindful of, it shouldn't be a reason to kill a topic."
"i have just read back through your posts on this thread elmicker and you haven't made any substantive arguments except to say the \"op is crap\" so there isn't really anything to reply to. the one thing you have said is that this topic is less important than 30/90 gtcs and shouldn't be on the agenda in priority to that. i have replied that that other issue is already on the agenda so your argument is a bit void. its a bit rich for you to be accusing other people of selective responses when you haven't actually brought anything to the table yourself."
"i agree, i was clutching at straws really. however, the fact that this is still a terrible proposal is a very, very good reason to kill a topic.let's try a paxman strategy. a straight yes/no question to the politician.jade. will removing outposts improve the ability to reside in 0.0 as a neutral entity?"
"i don't think there's anything wrong with this sentiment elmicker, but you do understand that what you say is entirely contextual right? i think you'll have to show what issues are being ignored in favor of this one and why they deserve a higher priority to make your argument stick.i recall the question of \"how many issues can the csm bring before ccp\" being asked during the campaign, and if memory serves the answer was \"as many as time allows.\"so i think you need to show that there are more issues of more importance than time will allow, which you haven't.it would be interesting to have someone (maybe you) create a thread that analyzes the issues before the council and gives an opinion on how they should be prioritized. but without something like that your argument falls flat, no?"
"absolutely right!oh, except for this post, the back end of this post, and as i recall, i requested your responses to alex shurk's points on about page 4. unless i'm missing something you haven't responded to those either.they were all points and arguments as to how destruction of outposts would negatively impact 0.0 space, so all extremely relevant to the argument."
"well it was a centerpiece of my csm election campaign and 2436 players voted for me. i'm guessing quite a few of those players felt it was a worthwhile issue to discuss with ccp. i'm now doing what needs to be done to ask that question. would you suggest i should ignore all those people that voted for me and sweep the issue under the table because 30-40 enthusiastic detractors are posting against in this topic? i refer you to the answer above. you haven't questioned the proposal you said (and i quote) \"its crap\". that doesn't count as debate round our way old chap. i stand by that stance absolutely. i really don't care about your point of view if you can't express it in an adult and respectful fashion. in my line of work i won't stand for disrespect from work colleagues, and i'm not going to stand for swearing and bad behaviour from fellow eve players either. if you can't behave i will ignore you and discount your opinion. its my right just as its your right (i guess) to act the fool and swear and shout on an internet forum.i'll restate it for you. i don't believe its possible to have a good argument from a person who cannot control their temper well enough to post respectfully on an internet forum."
"erm, no? without something like that my argument is just entirely theoretical. as this thread has proved, the csm is entirely for purely theoretical thread, as there's zero empirical evidence in the op or any subsequent posts in support. i.e.jade: outposts are detrimental to 0.0 life, let us blow them up!experienced 0.0 dwellers: no, that's stupid.jade: #care.elmicker: outposts blowing up is detrimental to csm efficiencyexperience csm council members: no, you're stupid.elmicker: #care.see how it works?"
"your first point is just repeating what hardin (and many others have already said) and i (and many others) have already responded too. your second point was covered also in responses to other posters. i have absolutely no intention to repeat myself 100 times addressing identical repetitive points that have already been covered."
"the only way i can see making this viable is if you created a mod for a titan that was capable of destroying an outpost. it would also make the titan vulnerable for a short amount of time. this way you introduce risk versus and reward and give titans a new role that i have heard it needs.if they were capable of being destroyed by a bunch of partisans in comedy fleets stealth bombers then i don't think it such a good idea i still believe the head of csm is pushing his own pet project here i have been saying that since word go, glad so many people agree with me."
"yes. those 2436 people don't care enough to hit the support button, so it's obviously not the issue they care about. if they cared that much, where are they now?bawwwwwww selecting responding. look up, i've pointed out where i expanded on the arguments (mostly arguments already made by other people). though if you really need me to i can write them out again in full. i can even use longer words to make you feel more comfortable.colourful language is not necessarily an indicator of anger. words are words are words. they're simpyl a tool. respet cannot be conferred via internet spaceships, so what does it matter how the words are framed? it's what's inside the frame that matters."
"the problem is elmicker that is essentially your argument and \"no that's stupid\" isn't going to convince anybody."
"if you can't debate with respect i'm not interested in hearing what you have to say. clear enough? if you don't like it feel free to vote for somebody else next time. i'm very happy standing as a candidate for people who can control their emotions and post respectfully in debates on matters of internet spaceships and the balance issues surrounding them.sorry if you feel this disenfranchises you elmicker, but i'm not going to pretend to care about people slurring insults on an internet forum - csm rep or no csm rep"
"jade:will blowing up most outposts encourage unaligned empire dwellers to fly into 0.0?if you say yes, how can they comfortably live and prosper in deep 0.0 without the safety of a pos/outpost? (beyond logging off at safespot/cloaked)does outposts not present a viable/easy possibility for many unaligned to live and prosper in 0.0, where as in the past they had to join/align themselves with established groups in 0.0 to survive? (again, beyond roaming/safespotting/cloaking)"
"it would probably be more shocking and an all round better reveal if i didn't have a link to a film showing an destroyed outpost in my siggy line beside an essay on the benefits for destructible outposts and enhanced dynamism in 0.0 yep of course its a pet project. it just happens to be one that 2436 fellow eve players seemed to agree with. who else gets to make that claim really?"
"hey jade, this thread is now 11 pages long and only has 36 supports. maybe you should take the hint and shut up ^_^"
"i'm not sure i'd pick \"comfortable\" as one of the first adjectives to describe the intention for 0.0."
"a vote for you means the voter supports all of your ideas? that is very convenient. hey, here is an idea. why not skip the discussion of topics all together and just have the reps vote up issues they want to push. after all, they got the votes so naturally that means everyone agrees with everything they say, right?"
"i'm going to refer you to another posters reply earlier in the thread there are no unaligned outpost owners in 0.0"
"cva, seriously dont make arguments that cva \"fights for the little guy\" because you encourage them to setup in providence.everyone knows you do this because it increases your power and influence, as does hardin's alliance creation scheme, and thus increases the numbers of potential allies when a fight comes."
"i hear there's these stations in 0.0 space that are owned by npc corps. can anyone who actually undocks c/d this for me?"
"he said outposts not stations."
"well pezzle would you agree a fair degree of the people who voted for me supported a fair number of my ideas? how about that? otherwise why do you think they voted for me?"
"i get exactly where you're coming from with the problem of 0.0 and the sov system as well as the impact smaller organisations can have on an area of spacebut this just ain't the right solution, because it has a lot of unintended consequences.the most important is that lack of security. when someone logs off to go on holiday for two weeks, they want to know that when they come back, even if their alliance collapses and they lose all their pos, space etc, their assets will still exist in game.because it is just a game. even if you lose an outpost and docking rights, you still have the opportunity to recover those assets you have stuck in station through hard work or whateverthis change basically completely devalues outposts. there isn't much you can't do cheaper with pos, but guarantee security is one thing, and security is one of the cornerstones of any civilisation.security is already a lot worse in eve than irl. it'd be even more unrealistic to make it worse.a better idea would be to improve the system whereby outposts are damaged and subsequently repaired"
"this post wins the thread war!it is one of our longest running jokes in the cva that if hardin makes an alliance prepare for the war dec, pirate infestation, move to red on the settings board. someone can probably take the time to make a list but its quite shocking how many hardin created alliances are our enemy."
"lol, you really think being popular makes you right?but like i say, i think you got the wrong solution to the right problemedit: the reason you got elected is because you changed what csm was all about.setting the agenda right before you were even elected was a stroke of genius. not only would it give you extra leverage and power once elected, as you had been given a mandate on specific issues that then could be pushed legitimatelybut more importantly, people want to have an input and make a difference in the game they all love, and your whole campaign basically revolved around politicising the thing, making it from players auditing ccp's processes and gms to players directly affecting how the game developed. through you, the players become the devs"
"spoon this is both a great idea and actually already part of the op:"
"except your responses were invalid. consistent references to isk and no references to force projection, strategic importance or denial of space.though, if that's the only response you're going to give, it's the only response i can in turn respond to. absolutely. so, if you could clarify, which aspect of outposts is currently unbalanced that would be rectified through addition of destruction.as far as i can see you need to take the outpost to exact destruction on it, so nothing would really change for the original holder - rather there are now more advantages to taking it.this isn't necessarily a good thing. most of the things you've listed probably wouldn't happen. for example outpost ransoming. outpost \"sales\" have happened in the past. they cannot be guaranteed. you've already taken the outpost once, there's nothing stopping you to do it again.countdown battles already exist (ref: insrg vs. nc was decided by a to-the-minute fight to take sov before sov 3 kicked in). adding a secondary post-sov countdown battle wouldn't do much. if someone has taken the outpost and sov, you aren't going to take it back inside the same theatre of battle. and if you've got sov, outpost construction is a doddle, so it simply adds more risk for the defenders, and more offensive options for the attackers.outposts are not large losses isk wise, they're large losses only in terms of strategic control and territorial denial. the attacker is fighting to remove the outpost, the defender to stay in the outpost. adding the ability to remove the outpost outright, again, gives more advantages to the attacking side. (remember fights are rarely over a single outpost).scorched earth retreats would be interesting, but if you're at that stage, you've already lost, your opponent has sov and reconstruction is no major barrier. however reconstruction for the defender after a forced scorched earth (i.e. goons scourging geminate) would be near impossible. again, the advantage lies with the attacker.and showdowns at hqs? why would that happen? the station has no tactical importance. fighting occurs at poses because theyre the only static combat point with tactical and strategic importance.there's a consistent correlation between all of those scenarios that enhance eve in your mind. they all give significant advantages to the attacker once the fight has done.this moves away from eve's current balance where the attacker must hold the territory. if you remove that aspect, the requirement to hold the territory no longer remains. you can enact a \"scorched earth\" policy, and effectively hold the space without the requirement to defend any static points - taken outposts are as much a vulnerability as an advantage. that is an extraordinarily big bias in favour of the attacker, and something that if implemented and enacted upon would be the territorial equivalent of having hg snakes, +mwd boost rigs and istabs while your opponent is ****ing about in battlecruisers."
"isk is irrelevant. remember? eve is \"isk rich\". the only scarce resource (i'm sure this has been said) is pilot time. the time to defend a conquered outpost is comparable to the time your opponent expended defending it. if you don't expend that time, you're going to lose the outpost, which is fair. if you can destroy the outpost, you accomplish the objective of denying your opponent the outpost, without expending anywhere near the same amount of pilot time. how is that balanced?you're half right, half dead wrong. you're right that alliances will concentrate their defence, but not through any requirement enacted from warfare, but rather through personal preference. as it stands you must hold the space to stop your opponent re-taking it and being in a position to assault your own space (why do you think bob and goons have bothered to each conquer omist? it's a terrible region.). if they could wipe that space clean of outposts, there's nothing for your opponent to base from. you've got your concentrated defence. thowever, you are wrong in that a \"new alliance putting up a single outpost\" (a situtation that wouldnt happen at this point in the game) would find it easier. let's use bob as the example and fountain as the region. assume fountain is empty - bob have rolled in, kicked out pl, bruce and sot and destroyed all their stations. young alliance comes in and starts claiming sov to the north of bob's borders. what do you think bob are going to do? say \"what ho good chum! have fun up there!\"? no, they're going to roll on up and clean the space again, re-enacting the scorched earth policy. no one, nothing, will be allowed to build up in the vicinity of the larger alliances, because they'd pose a massive security risk. putting up a new outpost under fire with no sovereignty backup is near impossible compared to simply taking the space from a dying alliance like bruce, or like tri in the north, or like the dozens of nameless pets in the south.i disagree with both of you on this point. it won't change the amount of pvp initially. the process for taking the outpost is the same; shoot jammer, shoot pos, shoot station. all you're doing is appending \"hit button, receive wreckage\" on the end of that. bearing in mind once sov has been taken from the defender pvp generally reduces to a minimum, this won't change the level of combat over outposts.however, once the outpost has been destroyed, you've removed the ability of that system to effectively support pilots. in the future, you would not get roaming gangs basing from that system, you would not get ratters there as a target for roaming gangs. so while hardin is initially incorrect, he's right in the long term.couldn't care less about this aspect, history is written by the victor.i suggest you read my response to that. un-natural selection is unaligned and holds the outposts in cloud ring. there are others, also."
"the only measurement tool we have for support of specific ideas is the support check box (or people posting on the specific issue thread and saying yes or no, i suppose). at this time the centerpiece of your campaign has less support than monster truck titans. that seems clear and measurable. you do not have the support of those voters on this issue.so i am going to have to disagree =)"
"2436 is about 1.2% of the player base go team jade."
"that's actually the way it works pezzle, check the csm document - if a csm member supports a topic it goes up for a vote."
"why don't you change the op i want to crash my mom into an outpost causing irreperable damage cause i saw it in a ccp promo video, so therefore it must happen."
"sure, half of the alliances made are for pirate types which would be enemies anyway, and the others are potentially new buddies."
"i think this all needs to be brought back to the guiding paradigm of eve...if you can't afford to lose it in seconds, don't fly it, buy it or build it.and you ladies say carebears cry about having their factioned blinged ravens suicide ganked."
"damaging an outpost is already possible by disabling station services. if you want to allow attackers to damage them more (such as, perhaps, knocking out dock control so ships can't dock there) then i'd like to see an organized, thought-out proposal regarding that, which i could support a lot easier than this. perhaps something like this:********ten-minute outpost proposal********outposts will be given four additional subsystems: communications, power core, hangar bays, docking control. each one does something.communications: enhances pos attack mails - they will tell you the identity of the attacker as well as the number of people who are in local at the time.power core: all pos's in system get bonus powergrid, say, 10%.hangar bays: pos's will draw a small portion of their required fuel, say, 10% again, from a special hangar on the outpost, reducing pos refueling runs. if the hangar is empty, they will use fuel as normal.docking control: no benefit.at the beginning of the attack, everything is as it is now. attacker begins disabling station services, which generates a 'help, i'm under attack!' message to the outpost's owners.once all station services are disabled, station subsystems will appear and become vulnerable: communications, power core, hangar bays. these subsystems are more durable and difficult to disable than station services are, and destroying each one has certain benefits:communications: pos's in the system with the outpost will not broadcast they are under attack if outpost communications are offline.power core: all pos's lose their power bonus, and get a penalty to their power output equal to the bonus (so if the bonus were 10%, that bonus would be removed and a -10% penalty applied instead).hangar bay: if the hangar bay is disabled, items in the outpost cannot be moved until it is repaired. pos's can no longer take fuel from the hangars and must supply it all themselves.once these three systems are offline, docking control will appear as a target. disabling docking control means that ships cannot dock at that outpost until it is repaired. docking control is the toughest subsystem to destroy.after this, station capture will work as normal. i haven't done enough research on how to flip an outpost to know how it actually works, because it's never something i've had to worry about.this will effectively render the outpost useless, and even make it a liability to the people that control it, as now their pos's are penalized. however, the outpost is still there and can be repaired back up to operability if the controlling alliance still controls the system. if an alliance doesn't want to deal with controlling the outpost, they can always leave it in its wrecked state, but their pos's will be penalized for doing so, making the system easier to take.********end proposal********in my opinion, that proposal makes 0.0 more dynamic, to use a favorite word in this thread, than the one we're arguing over. it gives a conquering alliance a choice - scorch the outpost and render it useless, but suck up some nasty penalties and risk losing their system a lot easier, or repair and defend the outpost, thus possibly overextending themselves?"
"absolutely."
"for you maggot, buddy =)stay on target!"
"damaged =/= destroyed"
"the problem with disabling station services style solutions is it isn't permanent fiscal damage. attacker is at a net loss on the exchange the moment they spend stront/ammo etc to make it happen. defender just reps it all up with carriers in the attackers off time and nothing is achieved. if the attacker is going to put the kind of gang together that is needed to kill outpost services in a reasonable timescale they are better off hitting pos because at least if they put those in reinforced they do actually cause (some) fiscal impact and set up the potential for more."
"you have a policy of not responding to anyone who makes a personal attack, the least you can do is distance yourself from the support of those who do the same."
"isk is not a balance factor. this is not a fiscal issue."
"weren't you suggesting it would be great if assets in the station were recoverable?"
"and if you wanted to, you could make subsystems require stuff to be repaired (other than docking control, since you'd have to get the stuff into the station somehow). if they disable station services but get run off, too bad, no dice. if they take out a few subsystems or totally trash the outpost, then they might have to pay to get it repaired.see how flexible my proposal is?"
"appears as though we are back to the actual isk exchange of attacking vs. defending. can we factor in the cost of maintaining and fueling pos' networks to the cost of a station? can we factor in the build cost, transporation costs and defense costs?the cva has had an outpost in xr for over a year-i reckon the cost there is in the 100's of billions of isk when you consider the pos's have been fueled non stop, 100's of ships have been lost patrolling and protecting the area-allowing for that fuel to be hauled.if we are making it about the isk (i thought it was about dynamism) then lets set the definition for cost."
"can't it be about everything? why put blinders on the discussion?in the end the big picture is that every player-built object in the game can be destroyed - except outposts. why not look into bringing them in line with the spirit of eve?"
"because when the spirit of eve makes for a crappy, biased and boring game, it should be secondary to actually having fun. fun in 0.0 requires combat. to guarantee combat in 0.0 requires static combat points. as it stands, those are outposts and high end moons (and to a lesser extent, choke gates). the ability to remove outposts removes static combat points. logic dictates that this also reduces fights in the long term. there is no way reducing static points of strategic value can increase combat, that's backward logic. there should be more static points, not fewer."
"because other issues are more worthy of attention. in addition it would cause harm in terms of stagnation in 0.0 as we have said. the big picture really is getting more people to fight. less outposts = less people, less people = less fighting."
"make it cost the attacker 30 billion isk in \"explosives\" and make those explosives actually require some logistics to move in place, make it take 30-60 days and perhaps youd have a proposal worthy of consideration. the current topic as outlined by jade is built for griefing and for quick blitzkrieg type strategies. if jade's reason for being so passionate about this and/or the reason many of his supporters are voting yes is because they believe in the fundamental principal that everything that is created should be destroyable then i puzzle as to why making it cost 30 billion and take 30-60 days would be objectionable. interestingly most of the 33 people voting to support jade would fall into the \"everything that is built should be destroyable category\" they dont seem to cite that anything is wrong w/ the current system beyond that.i would be more in favor of these <issues> if they were posted as \"does ccp envision a time when outposts might be destroyable\". rather then these obviously slanted proposals favoring specific play styles and specific agendas.the unforunate thing about the entire csm process is its turning into each csm championing thier own pet projects. i dont believe this was the intent. most of us can recall the scandal that spawned this idea-i dont think the purpose at that time was to create a lobbying group of special interests. it was to create a body for the people by the people to interact, provide some transparency and oversight to and with ccp."
"okay :)well if allowing them to be destroyed causes an huge devaluation of an existing asset then the solution is simple - give them additional bonuses with value."
"well you know it sounds crazy - but something that could be considered as a general balancing factor to all kinds of structure warfare would be to actually make it cost isk (some substance in the cargo hold perhaps) to run armor reps on physical structures rather than ships. ie make people pay to repair the damage to their pos guns and kit rather than simply running capital armors reps on them? just a thought and not really part of this specific discussion."
"now this is an idea that has some merit. it's certainly not complete, but it's a good start, and i think something that faces few, if any, of the problems outlined in this thread. one amendment i'd make, however. don't make docking rights destructible, make hangar access destructible, and say that everything has to be repaired with nanite paste. this means you can have a bunch in hangar for repairing ancillary services, but you need to have it in your ship's cargo hold to repair hangar access, which means it'll take a fair bit of work and solid control of the space in order to restore the station to good working order. and if you like, put a reinforcement timer on that - some period of time where you can use items in hangar and remove them, but not add any more. it gives attackers the ability to inflict real cash and time damage on defenders, without depopulating 0.0 of outposts."
"you say this but we haven't had any examples yet. pretty much everything \"worthy\" of getting attention on these assembly halls forums is getting attention. this is contested and definitely not accepted as a universal statement of fact. its your opinion and the opinion of the anti-destructible outpost people. the other side of the argument views it as an unsupported canard of deeply questionable value."
"you keep forgetting the immense investment in dreadnaughts, carriers and support fleet + aggressive placed pos that are required to actually siege a system in the first place before you can actually conquer an outpost. these assets are placed in harms way at the beginning of the siege and represent the attacker's \"investment\". since i've in no way advocated a short cut to existing siege mechanisms as part of my \"example solution\" in the op - its blatantly untrue for you to present this as a blitzkreig/griefing proposal (even if the term \"griefing\" did have meaning in 0.0 freefire open pvp - which it clearly doesn't)."
"generally when one questions another's arguments, they provide evidence and potential scenarios to support it. simply saying \"we think your arguments are flawed\" does not mean they are actually flawed."
"we're kind of going in circles here, but these arguments you outline are what i find lacking:1. other issues are more worthy of attentionbeen over that, it seems there's plenty of room on the docket.2. destroyable outposts would stagnate 0.0.as long as there is an advantage in owning an outpost, people will build them. fear of an outpost boycott is pretty fanciful, and what this comes down to is the relative risk vs. reward of constructing an outpost. destructability can be part of the risk-reward equation.3. destroyable outposts would lead to depopulated (and peaceful?) 0.0see #2.if you want to argue that there's no way to balance the destructability of outposts in the risk-reward equation, i can only point at the pos as an example of where it was done before. if it works for the pos, it can work for outposts."
"just one little nitpick there, those are capturable stations not outposts in cloud ring."
"the time invested in this pales in comparison to the logistics of maintaining a new outpost potentially regions away from your home bases. to keep it going, you need to maintain equivalent logistics to conquering it but 23/7 for months on end. this is the limiter that prevents megapowers conquering all of eve - it's simply an impossibility.destruction of outposts at will allows you to prune the excess logistics, at best minimising the extent to which your forces and logistics become extended, at worst scouring a region to the point no one can establish themselves there. both of those give significant advantages to the conquerer that are not matched by anything the defender can do.give it time, we've only been there a fortnight anyway, doesnt really matter. it was a secondary point that had no actual relevance to the matter at hand."
"so from you \"answer\" then i am to assume you support the hauling of explosives and the 30-60 day period of time that the station must be held by the aggressor.also i cite:"
"no human being could possible supply the string of insults required to balance out this stream of tears... and that's all they are, sweet emo tears.there's no difference between an empire mission runner who autopilots a 3b cnr afk and an alliance profusely delivering the waterworks over the thought of a pos getting blown up in a system they visit only to refuel and restart queues. they are the same thing. i will mock both.i'd even go further and say that suicide gangs of cheap stealth bombers should be able to kill a pos."
"were this thread about pos's id find this reply fascinating."
"eep. wrong character. i always wonder why it defaults to this one..."
"edit: now posted with the right character.as to not derail this monster any more, my idea can be discussed and hashed out here."
"i'm actually heading out for dinner now. but i'll leave you with this: the whole \"if this happens 0.0 will be a burning void because goons (and cva) say it will\" argument is not anything i (or many others) find convincing. i have a lot of experience in 0.0 warfare and alliance management/politics/campaign planning - and while its easy for the footsoliders to talk about a \"griefing agenda\" (lets burn all those outposts for lulz) it becomes alot more difficult for the organizers, fcs, diplomats and planners to commit to an expensive, risky, and time-consuming program of destruction without a payoff at the end of it. destroying all outposts = no payoff. ransoming outposts? maybe, settling in friendly renters? maybe. but i am assuring you elmicker that nobody is going to want to commit a large capital fleet night after night in outpost sieging without there being some isk at the end of the rainbow. maybe they even do think its a good idea at the beginning? - that idea dies on the vine the moment the first enemy power hotdrops a counter cap fleet on them while they are kicking over the sandcastles of a smaller alliance. people lose caps? that hurts, it'll be a dash of cold water. as i said, this argument is a hypothetical doomsday scenario that doesn't hold water for anyone with a background of alliance management and arranging offensive pacts and maneuvers in 0.0 space. its being presented here as a children's story to scare people - it doesn't hold water and in my estimation it is absolutely not what would happen to the 0.0 landscape should destructible outposts become a reality. you can disagree, (i'm sure you will) and we'll agree to disagree but don't pretend for one minute that the other side of the argument hasn't thought these things through and presented their own opinions and analysis of the impact of this potential change."
"uh, a few pages back, a number of goons said this is exactly the sort of thing goonswarm would do. i think they know better than you the sort of stuff they might do.edit: now with quotes. from the first four pages (the rest is mostly arguing)."
"hehe, yes i can believe you lot might, say hi to that mighty carebear heikki from me however if you are saying that you are an unaligned outpost owner when you do infact own no outposts, i'm gonna feel free to nitpick :p"
"so yes, apart from the fact that you've been there for all of 10 seconds, you don't own anything a powerbloc would want to take from you.if they wanted to just kill you, they can do that now. they don't have to secure cloud ring (where the hell did you get this idea from anyway?) they only need to do that if they intend to do anything with it. no one is forced to secure a region they conquer, they do it because they have something to gain. either way, whether they want to destroy your outpost or not, they have to spend time and their resources in conquering the space.your argument can just as easily be extended to pos. and from there its just a hop and a skip to any asset, because at the end of the day thats all an outpost is. an asset. its time invested by a player or a group of players, just like everything else in the game. outposts aren't even expensive or difficult to build.how is destruction of anything in eve fair? having your outpost taken from you and sold or rented is every bit as unfair as having it taken and destroyed. are you upset because victor doesn't have to fuel a couple of sovreignty pos? how does destruction of anything lead to a \"vibrant\" game? your argument is inherently, and entirely flawed and based on the notion that destruction is bad for eve. it isn't. destruction is eve. without it, eve is nothing. without it eve is sisi.what game exactly have you been playing? missions in empire? want your tech 2 ships insured as well?"
"allaria i think you've fallen for what we on the internet refer to as \"trolling\"."
"no, destroyed is very different from damaged. there is a big difference between repairing an overheated module to salvaging something from a ship wreck. was implying that if anything, should be on the overheating side of thingsbut i still think that this will cause more problems than it solves even if watered down and there are much better ways to try to solve the same problems this attempts to"
"this would be what goumindong so affectionately calls an ad hominem. you're effectively stating \"you've got no experience in this so you're automatically wrong.\"comical on a few levels, because you spent multiple paragraphs posturing about questioning a poster's experience. oh, and also because i've got extensive experience in that area. i've worked in, for, with and against just about every entity in the game in just about every situation going, both pre- and post- sov changes.so, let's critique your argument. i could criticise your record, but i've actually got a decent argument, so i don't need to .yet again showing your inexperience. the payoff is denial of space. i've already adressed this point. when bob were pushing goons back and goons returned the favour, there was a small lull in the fighting as both entities paused to conquer omist. omist is a terrible, terrible region. no significant assets, crappy moons. yet, it needed to be conquered. it provides a supreme example of \"organizers, fcs, diplomats and planners\" committing to an \"expensive, risky, and time-consuming program of destruction without a payoff at the end of it. \"but that's because you are again simply focusing on isk. isk is not a factor. the payoff is in the denial of territory for your enemy. under current mechanics you're already forced to commit to conquer everything in your path so there's no need for me to prove that alliances commit to these endeavours because the evidence is there in every conflict staring you in the face!once they've conquered the space, which we have already established as a requirement, they're committed to holding it, even if they don't want the space.if they don't want the space, what possible reason do they have to hold it when the alternative to simply wipe the region clean exists? if there's no infrastructure there, the region is of no strategic importance, so does not have to be occupied. the only place you therefore need strategic infrastructure is on the front line and in your home. since the infrastrucure everywhere else is of no use and is a risky drain, what sane alliance would ever leave it in place when all they have to do is hit a button and maybe spend some isk?"
"except that it fits with what goonswarm historically did, and even the concept they were founded on. perhaps you've heard of something called jihadswarm?"
"you're suggesting making outposts into giant pos. do you know why there are so few outpost upgrades? because you get more value for money building 3 new outposts than upgrading one fullythe same would happen for outposts if you made them like giant pos. why put all your effort into one mega-expensive destructable outpost when you can spread risk and arguably do more with lots of posoutposts really aren't that great, and a fully upgraded one can't compete with an npc station. their value is a large part in the security they provide by their nature as indestructablelike i said earlier, this would seriously de-value them in real-terms usefulness to 0.0 alliancesedit: also pos are thoroughly borked in every sense, so it doesn't work for pos either :p"
"elmicker, you're trying to make an argument for why the goons will sweep across the map destroying all outposts just for fun, and as an example you're using an occasion when they conquered an outpost to use as a strategic launchpad to continue a campaign against an enemy.do you see how the example you give doesn't support the scenario you're defending?"
"that would be the fact ra and their new found friends in the north are established half a dozen jumps from us and are posturing for war. anyone who holds cloud ring needs a secure base to prevent them rolling through into fountain and the southern regions.yes they are. what would happen if bob didn't secure q and pb with goons on the doorstep?compared to the time you have to spend defending the space once you've got it (that's mostly fuelling poses, unfortunately), that's barely significant.no it can't. we've been through this. read the thread.can you operate an alliance to the point of dominating entire regions from a pos? or from a supercap? no. you can't. they have nowhere near the same strategic importance, so aren't comparable.no it isn't. if someone takes an outpost from you, you can always re-take it later once they've assumed the burden of holding the territory around. the effort required to maintain outposts increases exponentially with the amount of territory they cover. if you remove them instead of hold them, that effort no longer increases exponentially.that's partially one of the reasons, yes. the ability to deny someone access to a region without deploying pos infrastructure to secure the outposts (assuming the previous resident had to have poses up) is simply imbalanced.please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"just to add my 2isk to that, i wouldn't see it as a problem that all currently invulnerable outposts remained so until a power that has held them for at least 60 days enabled a flag that would then be permanently set allowing the outpost to be popped. or that there could be a new type of smaller easier to deploy and necessarily limited and totally destructible outpost added to the game.for me its the principle, that neither you nor i should be able to produce utterly invulnerable objects that provide some kind of permanent benefit to ourselves or others.currently an alliance that loses its outposts almost always has the option of leaving a number of jump clones in that outpost (or conquerable station) that can engage in some nifty market pvp against the new holders.elmicker, how many jcs of former holders turn up in xzh and 9-4 and play around with the market etc these days?"
"aye i suggested above already a new turret that you can fit to a titan (similar to your explosives idea) that takes a certain amount of time to activate meaning you have to defend the titan during this period on an open plan battlefield. thus giving titans a viable role and adding the risk versus reward to destructible outposts."
"err, no i'm not - they're not going to destroy outposts for \"fun\" they're going to do it for serious strategic reasoning. contrary to popular belief, goons don't just ride bikes.omist isn't a strategic launchpad to anywhere. you can base with greater ease from c and detorid into tenerifis and immensea. omist is only a strategic platform if those options don't exist. that's why leaving it unoccupied is not an option. if you could remove it as a strategic location altogether, it'd have been done when bob passed through, and goons would have been thankful for it. omist is the one case in eve of authentic \"didnt want that region anyway.\" having lived there for a time, it really is a terrible, terrible region in a horrendous location."
"i agree - and that's what jade is saying in the post you were disagreeing with. go check it out again. we're talking about the \"goons will turn 0.0 into a wasteland\" hysteria."
"if they don't \"secure\" the region after destroying your outpost, you could just put up another, assuming your organization survived the assault. not to mention that apart from the drone regions, stations are everywhere anyway. if they bugger off to assume those terrible burdons, you can just build another one. its just isk.and no once you have conquered something you are not commited to holding it. where the hell do you come up with this nonsense? you choose to hold it or you don't.isk doesn't matter right? thats what you yourself stated.and i'd not throw myself behind goum's ad hominem whines if i were you, considering that you are as guilty, and that goum's definition is based around whether the poster is in agreement with him or not. he's the worst of the worst when it comes down to it."
"ok, i have alot of better things to do right now so ill point out. less than 50 votes, no other csm support other than the op and its on the csm agenda.enough said."
"every issue on the csm agenda is there because a csm rep supported it. that's how it works."
"very well said. i thought the csm was supposed to be a stopgap between the player base and ccp jade mustn't of read that part."
"you say but i ask you this, what isk at the end of the geminate campaign for goonswarm? what rich isk awaits us in geminate? the single promethium moon? nobody sees any actual isk from taking a region apart from the corp / alliance, sure we get fancy reimbursement programs, jump bridges etc., but geminate sure as hell isn't providing it for us. if it's fun, we'll do it. fighting smash is fun, so we're doing it. blowing up entire outposts just because we can would be fun, so we would do it."
"so because a csm decides to push his/hers opinion despites the general opinion, lacking even the support of other csm members (and drawing the oppositiion of some) should mean that their opinion is more valid than anyone else? they suggest an issue then they should have to go through the same process as everyone else. op should not be enough validation for prpgressing to agenda."
"ikar everyone voted in the csm election knowing how the system worked, and jade won while being very upfront about this proposal being part of his campaign - you don't go and change the rules afterwards just because you don't like the result."
"you're right, it's a complete waste of time. but if it's one thing jade's good at it's wasting time with long drawn out posts / issues, everyone who voted for him should of seen this coming."
"csm members can put their own [issue] on the agenda and we don't need to vote on that. however, the csm council members then vote on whether the [issue] should be forwarded to ccp as part of the official list of issues. a majority vote is needed for this to win (5 for, 4 against, basically). we will see, on monday probably, after this weekend's meeting, which issues have made it and which have been voted down.i don't think every csm member has a personal [issue], only a few do. those csm's who pick [issues] from what we, the crowd, suggest, and forward them on should be commended.but, basically, the docket will contain the pet [issues] plus however many player-suggested [issues] seem to have high support numbers, and that's the way it is. i don't think any of the csm members are willing to go as far as compiling all the issues into some giant well-organized document and presenting that under the title \"ccp, fix your game!\"; it'll just be [bits] and [pieces] and [fotm's] in a tabulated form.edit: it's unclear what happens at the meeting with ccp. i imagine jade and each csm will get the opportunity to argue, as heatedly as here, for their own [issue], and whatever was picked from the crowd will just get a nod and a next. would have been nice to have him push something like [fix the ui] or other universal [issues] as heatedly as this, but i think ianna will do a good job with that, so maybe something good will come out of it after all."
"so your saying because someone had the rl time to commit to csm elections that someone else didnt that their opinion counts less than someone elses doess? everyone in eve is equal, heck if neccesary jade should have gotten you to post his threads for him to support in lack of all other support instead of posting on his own....wait this already happened."
"i never read the part in the csm draft that they were allowed to push their own personal projects against the face of popular opinion, cite examples please or you and your arguments become ignominious."
"i don't know if we get to veto any csm's [issue]; i rather doubt it.the [issue], however, must pass a csm council vote before it can be submitted to ccp. we will find out after this weekend's meeting logs are published. i think it'll pass, btw. we move on, ccp gives their answer, and that's that. good luck to everyone."
"page 4: linkageas for popular opinion - it's pretty split in this thread, but jade did garner the plurality of votes with this proposal as part of his campaign. it seems people are pretty open to it."
"as you said, the goal is to gain the support of a representative, not be posted by a rep to instantly be moved to the agenda. this thread has recieved no support from any representative other than the one which started it (which invalidates that person ability to pass it on, or at least should, as it implies their idea of eve is somehow superior to those they were elected to represent).this thread has neither gained 5% or a reps suppport, apart from the original poster and shoudlnt be on the agenda until one of these conditions is met. then again, that would imply this system was meant to be representative of the player base and not of individual people."
"2000+ people voted jade in on the basis that this was a key issue. i am sure one of us can post the \"issue\" if he likes and then he can support it thus meeting the criteria.in my view:-make them destructable-make it hard to destroy them-give outposts extra bonuses to compensate for the additional vunerability."
"there's nothing in the csm document that says this. any player may post a topic, and it has to be open for discussion for 7 days before a rep can bring it to the council. i suggest reading the csm documents."
"and over 10000 people voted for other candidates over this issue, but as ive said in this thread current outposts either need to be immune to this change or need to receive a massive boost to compensate for being made destructible, especially as jade has still to specify the 1 dozen + ways they have been buffed which he claimed earlier."
"and you dont think that it is an abuse of position to move personal agendas through without going through the same mechanisms as other threads? that a single person can take through their idea without the 5% player base consideration or other csm candidate support required by other threads?"
"why should current outposts be different than future ones? if they're all hard as hell to destroy, but even harder to take intact, those who put lots of work into maintaining them should still be able to do so. if you build something but get to the point where you can no longer defend it, you can take it away before someon else does. if someone else is militarily stronger than you, they can come take it away from you. not like a weaker alliance can realistically hold territory against a much stronger one now, but destructible outposts will be more realistic than permanent ones. i think it would make the game more interesting overall, but that's just my opinion."
"i feel i should put my own voice in to request outposts are made destructable, it will give 0.0 warfare another challenge and make 0.0 that bit more excitingbut they should be able to sustain an extended attack from multiple dreads."
"yes, yes, yes!"
"definitely, without an investigative body it doesn't make sense to even attempt to disallow suicide fraud (maybe prices and payouts should take this into account though...).on the other hand, no payout for suicide attacks makes perfect sense, because no investigation is necessary (the event is already recorded by concord) and it's not possible to game the system. furthermore, this isn't just insurance fraud, but insurance fraud used to gain profit in the process."
"actually it is still allowed unless specifically excluded. it is instead vandalism and propety damage, possibly arson depending on how it is done and that is jail time still.lawyer got insuarance company to to pay for smoking his expensive cigars and losing them in series of small fires. judge ruled insurance did not specify he could not smoke them himself and his claim was awarded. insurance counter sued for arson against insured property."
"approve : no insurance payouts for concord kills or self destruct.i'm not as sure about how to rebalance insurance payout amounts though, i do feel that t2 losses should hurt."
"i agree with improving t2 ship insurance somewhat. but no matter how much you higher t1 insurance ur still gonna get suicide ganked. also you seem to forget a ganker loses his privileges in empire which means doing some mindnumbing ratting. i'll agree to nefing up suicide ganking if ratting is made more interesting cause its bloody boring or more intersting ways to up your sec status. i'm not gonna waste my precious sec status on a t1 hauler with +4 i'm gonna wait for that dumbass afk with 200mil+ or if im really bored ill go with a 100mil but everytime i gank its a few hours of mindnumbing asteroid hopping. so i vote yes cause im still gonna gank your lilywhite ass no matter how high you make it for me. actually you will be doing me a favour i won't have to waste my time on the crappy 200mil kills ill go straight for the ones with a bil in loot, more profit less ratting thanks pal"
"remove insurance"
"yes insurence needs to be fixed. people **** out isk much quicker now compared to 3+ years ago. insurance should be removed from the game, not increased to benefit t2 ships."
"insurance ideally would cost a bit more for all t1 ships but should still be payed on self destruct and concordoken.t2 ships, no, fine as it is. noone seems to consider what will happen if you start handing out t1 level insurance on t2 ships, demand will boom as people start losing them and i doubt the moon mineral market could keep up. most of that extra isk injected into the economy will probably end up in the hands of the big moon holders as prices will undoubtably rise."
"this is correct. if we want to avoid t2 being the 'new standard', then leaving insurance payouts as it is good.furthermore, there's a fundamental difference between t1 and t2 production: t2 production relies on moon mining, which is a rather finite source. anything which drives the demand upwards will push prices up as well.so, a definite no to doing anything with t2 insurance payouts."
"i support the removal of insurance for konkordokken. that said, i cannot support the upgrading of insurance to fully cover the loss of t2 ships, (not until t3 becomes prevalent anyway) flying the shiny ships is supposed to be risky, it has consequences. t2 ships have benefits, the drawback to flying them is that you can't get adequate insurance on them to be fully covered, if you could, no one, except those that dont have the skills yet, would fly t1if the t2 ships are fully covered by insurance, it would also mean the suicide gankers would fly t2 instead of t1 and use less ships, giving each individual a bigger payout.everything in eve is supposed to have risk concurrent with reward.not supported"
"againstt1 ship insurance values should be reviewed on a monthly basis and adjusted. the current values are definitely out of line.capital ship insurance should be removed or greatly reduced.t2 ships should be not be insurable at all."
"t2 and capital ships shouldn't give any payouts. concorded ships giving a payout is fine.this forum isn't fine."
"removal of insurance for concord actions i like, to a point. it'll stop clowns who are suicide ganking for the lulz. will do exactly zero to stop the pros from hitting high value targets. when you hit a multi-billion isk target useing a few 100m isk ships the insurance payout won't matter in the slightest. common brutix only needs a 50m isk drop to turn 100% profit w/o an insurance payout.meanwhile. t2 ships are not ment to be disposable \"throw away\" assets. loseing one should be a painfull experience. i see no good reason to alter the currrent t2 (i.e. don't bother) insurance structure. if you study the market in detail you might discover many, many cases of players selling t1 ships under the mineral value. theroy being is that the idea of \"i mined the minerals myself so they're free\" has become entrenched in the general industral mindset. that is why the t1 insurance structure seems wacked at this time."

"as to the quote above i was trying to say that as for battleships, they became more like dreads being used for shore bombardment rather than ship vs. ship. and as for carriers, in my opinion, what made them more versatile was the piloted planes on them, ie. dive bombers, fighters, rescue, and recon. in addition the usn never sends a carrier anywhere without a support fleet, mainly due to their value and vulnerability. more carriers were destroyed by dive bombers and torpedo planes than by anything else. though looking at rl navy issues could present a solution, if we introduce the rl worries of fleet combat which in my opinion was more of the fast attacks crippling the equivalent of a cap ship and allowing the luxury of time to gain reinforcements to destroy them. so a possible solution would be to introduce the ability to cripple a cap ship (jump drive off line, speed/agility reduced, weapons off line or warp drive off line). this can be done either by having certain weapons that do damage more to systems then to shield/armor/hull. piloted bombers could be really effective in doing this. i believe this might also solve \"hot drops\" by forcing a capital fleet to think twice on whether or not the gang they are trying to \"hot drop\" on and omfgpwnage has these capabilities and would make they pay for such a move. now before everyone gets up in arms about this, and say \"that nerfs caps\", an easy solution to prevent ships with these abilities from crippling your cap fleet would be to have support there to either: intercept and destroy, repair caps if damaged, or to be there for general support until repairs are made or reinforcements arrive. this will still allow caps to be used but would encourage a more well rounded fleet with subcapital support."

"to me the cause of most of the problems in eve is the failure to think through what is actually happening in the world of eve. instead of thinking of the background and the logic of eve there is too much thinking about nebulous issues like game balance - not that that doesn't have it's place but it's overplayed. this creates three problems - firstly an excessive requirement for suspension of disbelief with phrases like \"yes but it's just a game!\", secondly it makes it harder for ccp and others to work out what should happen next, and thirdly it makes the game unstable (i'll explain that later).i'll get straight in with an example: what is a blueprint?well in realworld it's a bunch of diagrams and instructions for building something. (on blue paper traditionally - fancy that.) is that what it is in eve? \"ok joe i need 20 copies of this blueprint - pop down to the photocopier will you?\" hmmm problem? what the hell would be a bpc be? \"this blueprint will self destruct after 5 uses mr phelps!\" well you might say that the limits are legal. ho diddly hum. how does that work? who enforces these limits? (i had at one stage thought this was how ccp would make tech 2 more common by allowing bpc to be used without limit in 0.0 but the illegal product wouldn't be allowed to enter empire space. that's logical development.) how do you invent t2 bpc and once you've done it why do you have a limited supply?ok so how about an alternative logic for manufacturing. suggestion: in eve manufacturing is done by nanites. drop the appropriate nanites in a manufacturing bay along with the materials and they produce the required product. a bpo is actually a device for producing the nanites. a bpc is a collection of stored packages of nanites. bpc take longer to make than the product because storing these things is dangerous and tricky. invention is a process of taking a batch of nanites and trying to slightly alter their programming - also dangerous and tricky, and unpredictable.everyone with me so far? now some people will be here going what's the point? you're not suggesting actually changing anything!? oh but i am. and in any case that's only part of the point. keep going please. once you know what's going on and why you can think more effectively about the whole game.second example:ccp decide that a ship is overpowered/underpowered. a change is brought in in the next patch. your character wakes up. \"wtf!?!??! my ship had 7 turrets yesterday and today it's only got 5!? wtf happened?!\" (talking the eos here.) eve reality and sense shot to hell. but they needed rebalancing you say. doesn't matter there are other ways of doing things. sometimes ccp do it from a roleplaying point of view. motherships grossly overpowered - able to jump out in low sec and nothing anyone could do to stop them. but this time ccp handle it well - new technology introduced of warp disruption field generators with focussed beams. now the mothership pilots may be going damn. but they arent going wtf. new technology is a part of eve life - and very sensibly and believably so. those mothership pilots in eve may be annoyed but they aren't wondering what happened to the nature of the universe! and they aren't finding they can't undock because their ships are now a nonsense. (ok ms can't dock or undock anyway gimme a break.)"
"this is what i mean by making the game unstable. in reality if you buy the world's fastest car you may wake up tomorrow to find someone has a faster car. you dont' wake up to find it has a new top speed 100mph lower for no reason at all. if things need rebalancing new stuff can be introduced to balance it. and sure sometimes that won't be enough and the nerfbat or boost may have to be brought in - but that should be an emergency measure not something done casually. it gets you (you=ccp) in big trouble and i'll get back to that. also you have to accept that no matter what changes you make some ships will always be less popular and some be more. you cannot make everything equally useful it just isn't possible. the big one. what on earth is going on in eve? what is a pod pilot?all sorts of things in eve don't appear to make sense - and yet can easily be made to do so. let me run through some of the problems:1) why do empires let pod pilots run around the place doing what they will with barely any attempt to restrain them even - let alone force them to serve in the empires navies or whatever as you would expect?2) why are npc ships generally so much weaker than the same pc ship?3) why do npc ships almost never warp out of combat?4) where are the billions of crewmen coming from who die in pc ships every day? why do they not have to be paid?5) why do the empires happily provide pcs with free newbie ships if they have nothing else?6) why are pcs able to be cloned when they die but npcs are not and frequently die permanently? (sometimes with weak explanations of \"we found and destroyed all their clones.\")7) why do the empires let weak pirate ships roam their own belts? normally you'd think that only the strongest pirate ships would make it deep into the empire not the weak ones.8) why do pcs do all the weird things they do?9) why do pcs frequently know next to nothing about their own world and how things work? i mean if they've just had years of training to become pilots surely they'd know more than they do?i could come up with plenty more too but that will do for now.ok suggested explanation (i can think of others for the record but this is my favourite and this is my post) :pods are jovian technology (given originally to the caldari as per the background story) that enable one man to control a ship all on his own from a sensory deprivation tank. unlike a normal ship a pod pilots ship has a crew of one. however being put in a sensory deprivation tank and essentially \"becoming\" a ship is more than most peoples minds can take. 80% of pod pilot trainees become mad. and by mad i mean gibbering idiots who fail the course. those who do pass are frequently psychotic and at the very least a bit odd.to answer my own questions:1) the empires find themselves unwilling to get their own navy personnel to go through such an effectively suicidal procedure. only volunteers are taken and they can come from any station in life. if there was only one empire the procedure wouldn't be allowed but each empire needs it's own pod pilots for the hope of military power and for the enormous improvements they bring to space business. they are just too nuts to be fully controlled so the empires don't try but instead hope to benefit from their economic achievements and their support. agents are setup to encourage them to follow any given empires line.2) the enormous control that a pod pilot has over his ship makes them more dangerous than a crewed ship. instant responses, no orders being passed.3) crewed ships have to shut everything down and get their crews in acceleration couches for warp travel - of course pod pilots are always ready.4) there are no crewmen.5) each empire is hoping for the support of it's own pod pilots when trouble comes."
"6) anyone could be cloned - but to be cloned you have to be wired in to the middle of a couple of tons of high tech machinery. not a problem for a pod pilot but not a way most people can live their lives.7) empires know that pod pilots are frequently psychotic and start out looking for something to kill. they are happy to let pirates provide weak targets and let the pod pilots do the fighting. they are channeling the pod pilots the way they want them to go.8) they are frequently mad. i mean just look at player names? how sane are most of them?9) pod pilots are volunteers from any background not trained navy personnel.in summary - i'm asking ccp to create a more consistent background - perhaps following the above examples, perhaps not. so we know what is going on. so we can judge whether something is logical in the world of eve. so the game can be stable - which doesn't mean no change! it means not randomly changing the things that are already in.last point - i said failure to follow these rules can get ccp in trouble. well an example - cargo expander 1 bpos were changed overnight into cargo expander 2 bpos. this was obviously completely unfair - and spectacularly stupid. it gave unfair advantage to some people and hurt others massively. and the reason it was unfair was because no sensible thought could have predicted it. the world of eve changed overnight, in a way no sane person could have predicted - for no reason whatsoever. i could give you dozens of other examples. and this is the key thing - stop doing this."
"i'm in full agreement, a lot of the changes are immersion breaking and very irritating. one way out when nerfing ships would be to grandfather the existing ships of that class and have all newly off the production lines varieties be of the latest greatest design."
"i sort of see what you're saying, but there's two major problems. one, this is a game before it's a universe, and it has to be treated as such. while it's nice to swear off certain changes for role-play reasons, it's just not feasible. two, a lot of your proposed fixes actually violate your principles. what pod pilot would wake up tomorrow, find out his entire crew had disappeared, and shrug his shoulders?"
"are you asking for a retcon of the lore to explain game features better? or are you asking for more stories and roleplayed patch notes from now on?ps: blueprint = the complete program/procedure/set of instruction, and the chip or computer it resides on, that allows you to reconfigure a car manufacturing factory to produce a different kind of car, in volume. it's millions of processes that must be re-calculated and controlled in detail, so that the robots don't make a 1 micron mistake and weld the wrong thing, not to mention supply flow, work flow, safeties, testing, and so on. don't think joe can make 20 copies of that easily.i agree with your other example, though, and with the questions and answers posts. not sure what you want / they can do, though."
"as i said on cva forums:naming conventions:a lot of the problems are to do with naming conventions in programming. when you initially code something, often the prgrammer will pick a name for a class / object or game concept, but slowly over time it will evolve, change or you'll realise you can't really do it the way you envisioned. thus what you end up with isn't either what you had in mind or what you originally called itbut the names stick because no one can be arsed to go back through the code and change it in every place, and the devs have already talked about this or that in the dev blog\"magical\" changes:this is really rather dangerous as one of star fraction's arguments is that the sov system is unrealistic as overnight you magically gain the ability to anchor and online cyno jammers and jump bridges or whatever else with no logical or realistic explainationthis is why i've suggested having sov based on fulfilling the needs of an npc population and developing a system to give legitimacy to a basic sov claim made with towers. the system needs just a little changing and explaining so that changes made by devs fit in with the storyline betteriicr, there is a backstory about blueprints and it says they are actually specifications. no two blueprints are the same and the reason you can do me research on them is that you can improve the actual design and still have a product that convorms to the \"vespa medium drone\" specification and thus has the same stats for less inputthe real crux of the problem though is that there are various legacy and design flaws in eve.for example, the whole economy will never develop beyond a certain point since there is no way to differentiate two different products on the market aside from price and location. you can't get a more durable or more reliable or cheap and cheerful, made in a sweatshop kessie, as whoever makes it, it is exactly the same, identical item. but if you let people make their own items, a) balancing issues b) explosion in the number of items in the database. devs have said before \"it'd be nice, but not likely this decade\"edit: i've given up on eve. just playing it till something better comes along and blows it (and every other mmo) out of the water"
"disagree, i like the idea that ships have crews."
"pod pilots do not replace ship crews entirely, they merely replace the 'bridge' crew: ie, the 'never centre' of the ship.pod pilots don't suddenly have the ability to do all the manual internal ship abilities, such as actually storing the cargo, loading the ammunition, changing out your equipment, cleaning, etc. (they are stuck in a pod while flying, and not all the time, contrary to popular belief that once i a pod you're stuck ther forever. pilots do get out of it when doocked.) the pod pilot merely picks what they want done (reducing command time to virtually nothing). the crew still has to make sure it's all done.on a side note but related to immersion: clear skies would not work: a three man crew on a tempest? no way three people are running everything on a ship that is actually bigger then portrayed. they forgot they need a large crew (in the thousands), especially with no pod pilot. (er but other then that tidbit great movie!)i reckon most people don't get 'immersion' though. they completely ignore things that have no physical numbers for them to min-max or effect the game.take fw for instance, they see no value on anything in-game visible only, that has no modifications to any stats or attributes such as ranks or medals. they just see blowing other ships up as the only benefit to something and gettign useless killboards running. (which aren't even helpful in the least themselves, so why they complain about ranks is beyond me.)back to the blueprints though...yeah i've always been meh at why blueprints have a limited run of copies as far as immersion goes. but i reckon that's immersion that had to go out the window in order to get them working in the games ecnomoy. (we made the copies out of sub-standard digital records that degrade if read too much?)for the magic changes. yeah that stinks as well. personally sometimes, it's up to the player to do the work on his onw. (which is an almost impossible task for the kids without a shred of immagination in most online games, as none have ever roleplayed in their life with pencil and paper, and seem to have no interest beyond shoot 'em all dead.) we the players just have to 'assume', perhaps the mechanics made some tweaks to the ship design in order to make it work, and it went fleet wide. technically it was a free hull upgrade/refit. i wouldn't complain if a station did that. i'd just go: ok, what did you all fek with this time? oh, shiny. ok that's different...now give me a list of the changes, and i'll see what i can do.so in some ways, it's part of the gamers responsibility to get things done, and the games as well, to give a great backstory and show what mistakes the gamers have made to what's been written for the backstory before. pod pilot issues and crews is the number 1 common mistake in eve, because some can't be bothered to read the old in-game stories and old diagrams. and why should they? they don't give a rats arse how many ship and crew they blow up because it's not a game stat/effect. i blame ccp for not doing more on that subject though. but that's another topic that's ben discussed, and never given a direct answer from ccp about its future.until then, we'll have to take all the changes in stride and do some immersion on our own. perhaps if we make it work enough (more stories that are correct and in-line with what's been set, and that actually used some common sense and immagination to make it work, rather then ignoring it) then ccp wmight go: hmm, ok let's make it part of the in-game mechanics (since it seems to be the only way to get some pilots to acknowledge it)."
"would be difficult to pull off, since balance changes mean nerfs, and nerfs mean making something worse. how can you icly explain that your sensor booster which worked great three hours ago now needs a script to work less than half as well?i'd love the idea of keeping game changes ic, i really would. however, i think it's impossible.other than that, i like the idea of making as much in the game world as possible make ic sense, and because of that, i'm going to go ahead and support this, just to see how much of it is actually possible without violating prime fiction. gotta keep the writers busy, and besides, i miss the old technical/historical chronicles."
"theres very simple rl example of how something can be made worse.its called regulation. its how i think of nerfs."
"nerf focused fireif i had to pick one issues with eve to fix it would be this. my suggestion is to nerf it in correlation to the weapon size of the attacker to the attacked.how this would work:example 1: frigate vs. battleship: frigates would be able to attack in groups without being nerfed until their dps is roughly equivalent to that of a battleship. to avoid complex, on-the-fly server calculations and to endure proper effectiveness of quality configs; this would need to be a pre-determined number of attacking frigates based off standard t1 configs.example 2: battleship vs. battleship: 2 battleships attacking 1 the second would be nerfed by %50 a 3rd attacker by %75, 4th by 87.5% and so on. still providing an advantage to focused fire, but not making it as much of a i win button as it is right now.as far as storyline goes, the nerf is attributed by conflicting targeting data as generated by multiple ships and static caused by the volume of fire, thus degrading tracking accuracy.also this is probably how it should work. the nerf numbers arent set in stone but rather a ever increasing chance of missing as attackers are stacked (nerf to targeting speed or sig rad)."
"i can appreciate the sentiment but this is really against the spirit of cooperative gaming. not only that, it would be exploited :p no thank you =)"
"don't think so."
"incredibly bad idea."
"you actually like the way it works right now or is it that my suggestion is technically/tactically unfeasible?"
"if a was a muggle i would post something like epic fail.but i'm not so how about you get some friends and learn how to call primaries and stop whining."
"not supported. i just don't think this is workable. also, it's already in the game to a degree. the implementation is found in the higher tracking of small weapons, the speed differences between large and small targets, the size dependent target lock times, the decreased damage large missiles do to smaller targets, etc.best regards,windjammer"
"both, actually. big fleets aren't a bad thing, and i don't want to force everybody to go capital to dodge the nerf. similarly, implementing it in a way that is both technically feasible and easy for players to understand, without producing perverse incentives or stupid outcomes is near-impossible."
"the last thing this game needs is more capitals. on the contrary to your point, i think this would insure less capitals by making smaller ships more viable defensively. we already have tracking penalties which balance large vs small. what was overlooked is how easy it is to alpha one target and simply eliminate it. ive done this myself and had it done too me. its just not fun outside of controlled conditions like the tournament. also, im not against large fleets. although ive never participated in one myself, id imagine my idea would work even better there, with squadrons and battle groups attacking in patterned formations, rather than everyone just eliminating 1 or 2 targets at a time then moving on to the next. its just lame combat imo."
"against this personally."
"this would be a terrible idea because motherships can hit 200k dps tanks and could just be completely indestructible solo (not to mention rr blobs).pretty terrible troll imo."
"this just in. more damage = more damage."
"actually focus fire is a integral part of \"combat\" you focus on the target that will hurt you the most and work your way down."
"a) if you were fc and there was 1 recon of each race, who would you primary first?b) both gallente and minmatar recons can fit a buffertank and nano, so if they get targeted they can burn out and warp away. falcons must dedicate all their midslots, lowslots and rigslots to be competitive."
"features + ideas threads concerning proposed changes to productionnow, this thread isn't for discussing the merits of any of the individual ideas in the linked threads, that's what those threads are for. if you have comments on any of the individual ideas there then post them up on the trhead as they're currently works in progress.however, this thread is to ask the question:-do you believe that the production process in eve should be made more complex in order to introduce new niches in the market for new players to exploit?"
"my personal take on this would be that it is necessary. most people thinking about production changes are suggesting to go bigger and better in terms of longer term goals for eve.however, i'm more of the belief that the current pinnacle should be the long term goal, it should just take longer to reach that pinnacle.at the moment, production outwith capital ships pretty much goes minerals > completed product.depending on the complexity of the item being built i would suggest that the process should go:-minerals> small components> finished product (modules)or minerals> small components> larger components> finished product (ships)much like the current model for capital ship production."
"t2 ships/modules (well, actually the t2 components need components too so its closer to the second one)t2 stuff:minerals+ t2 components = t2 itemmoon minerals --> reactions --> t2 componentsof course there are t2 capitals too which are even more complicated due to production of t2 capital parts.we already have this."
"this is true, however these ideas were focusing more on t1 production.for t2 it would become something like thisminerals > components > basic t1 itembasic t1 item + morphite + advanced components > t2 itemhowever, this isn't to discuss the merits of an individual idea. the statement at the end of my first post is what this thread is to gauge the support for.if the consensus is that we do want manufacturing to be more complex then we need to propose ideas at that point as to how that could be accomplished."
"yea this another one of those \"i heard from the grape vine\" things. i want to actually know what they are addressing. i could not find anything about this topic by the dev's, could you please link the source?also your proposal seems very tedious and scripted. bruce tried this patrol bit, and the players got over it pretty quickly. it becomes a grind.i have read other threads like this, and a lot of the push comes from players that feel they are entitled space that the big alliances are not using. i am sorry but g, one, foe, m0o, bob, lv, rise, tri goon, pl, razor, smashkill and many others started small and in empire that developed a plan, had some set backs and followed through with hard work and determination. from what i am reading you want to lower the bar for corps that do not have the will or effort to try to make it work. the alliances are special because they all had a plan and succeeded on the \"hard level\". i would be interested in seeing what the dev's have on the board to address the pos issue. because you are eluding to the \"fact\" that they are working on the issue to give your proposal some kind of credibility."
"one idea i'd like to bring up the csm because unlike a goon i know who thinks they aren't reading they are.anywaysi've had one idea i've really liked and i want to see what the csm thinks.basicly make it so you can build planetary bases. this bases run pos logistics. with the basic idea being that you have to build hualers and you have to stock pile fuel at the base. (the base is in space and can be attacked by the way)so basicly you build this base, you build ships, you stockpile fuel.now the hualers you built become npcs that refuel poses for you even when your off line, using the stock pile, meaning you have to stock pile just one place, not 40.they only refuel within system or only that planets moons.the other thing is those hualers will be attackable, thus you could get a small gang and take out hualers thus hurting that allainces pos services.the only other thing i want to bring up is removing poses from sov would be the best idea imo. replacing it with planetary control."
"oh is this the issue? then my opinion, is gtfo csm.first reason: how come no one really knows the definition of dynamic (except goum)? anyone who has taken a basic physics course can tell you that dynamics is the study of objects and energy in motion or continuous change. so when you say something like you don't want station ping-pong, you want something dynamic, you do realized that having a station change hands many times in a week would be very dynamic and that you look like you don't know what you are talking about, right?second reason: the almightly chariman of csm (jade constantine) gave a simple \"i support this\" answer. are you aware of the discussions on other forums like mothermoon copied here? are you a massive sov holding alliance? do you have any ideas? what are your thoughts? a simple \"yup, ok\" repsonse is a slap in the face to all the people in csm who want to take it seriously. many more people like mothermoon give out lots of helpful ideas in the ***appropriate*** place and do so without being asked or elected and knowing that their ideas probably have a snowballs chance in hell of making it into the game. but they all add in much more thought and time and effort than the csm chairman, nice. grats all, grats all.i gave the csm a fair shot, but all these terrible reponses by csm members gives me the attitude of gtfo out my game you whiners.also, ibtmitnal"
"i really think the whole sov issue needs to be looked at, using pos as the sov holding tool allows the big alliances to run around the whole map, grabbing profitable moons and being able to defend them with capital and supercapital fleets thanks to jump bridge networks. at some point, the big alliances will own all the profitable moons and control who gets what in the way of t2 ships by controlling the t2 product market. while the specifics need to be discussed in depth, the issue needs to be addressed."
"please see the dev post mothermoon quoted a couple posts after yours."
"well hey maybe i should run next time"
"there are several definitions of dynamic - one relates to physics as you mentioned. the others are:2. characterized by continuous change, activity, or progress: a dynamic market.3. marked by intensity and vigor; forceful. see synonyms at active.4. of or relating to variation of intensity, as in musical sound.clearly, #2 is what we're talking about here - the antonym of static.while i recognize that a certain level of dynamics would be so chaotic and back and forth as to be labeled \"ping pong\" - that doesn't mean the only other option is trench warfare.i am aware of that discussion, and if you read it you'll see my posts in that very thread - in fact i referred to it and linked to it at the start of the example system linked in the op :)frankly, i don't see why either of these reasons you cite support not inquiring as to what ccp's plans are for sovereignty and how much input the playerbase can have via the csm."
"ok, lets put this simply. ccp put a thread in general discussion i believe it was, asking for suggestions on improving the sov system.ccp have understood their is a problem. they have asked for an opinion. they are considering this. this thread is copletly unnecessary and if brought up in iceland ccp will say \"well we have asked for player opinion, we have recognised this is a problem, we are trying to fix it....what more do you expect?\""
"yup, and this thread suggests that the csm inquire as to where that revamp is headed so player input can continue to be a part of how it is fixed. definitely something the playerbase should be represented on."
"perhaps you could repost the <issue> then. \"check with ccp to follow up on thier stated intention as outlined in a previous dev. post to revamp sov.\"that appears to be the standard star fraction reply when thier agenda gets challenged. \"whats wrong with just bringing it up\". this of course only surfaces after thier very specific star fraction friendly suggestion is assaulted and picked apart.well why not phrase your issues as \"just going to bring this general topic up\". its your specific approach that every problem must be solved with a star fraction play style friendly solution that is the real concern. add to it that jade gives blanket approval to such ideas and we have ourselves a problem."
"i'd be happy to update the op to clarify this point.however i think the only biases you're revealing are your own. i'm very happy to have a vigorous discussion about the positives and negatives of the current sov system and how they might be improved upon, especially in light of what we've seen from the devs so far about what they're thinking. but you have to get past your ingame political views to really have it be productive."
"my in game views? the only changes i see star fraction and jade actively championing directly benefit star fraction gameplay.i am perfectly happy to see change that makes life tougher on the cva. we do what we do and will adapt-always have.i do think bad ideas are just that-bad ideas. changes to sov are fine with me-but i disagree with your changes. destructible outposts-while not my first choice of things for the csm chair to become zealous about are fine with me-as long as the changes balance both the investment in constructing and maintaining the outpost vs. taking it. (ie. make it tough to blow it up, cost isk, cost 30-60 days) time. if you can take it and you can hold it against counter attack for 1-2 months-blow it up! i think its an awful idea and will erode 0.0 settlement but if the majority of the populace supports..que sera sera...and i am glad you will update the op. i look forward to the clarification.now lets see star fraction get behind something that works counter to star fractions playstyle...."
"range and dps have always been a trade off. when you're at distance and using long range weapons, you do less dps, but you're protected from a lot of weapons by that distance. when you're in close with close range weapons, you do a lot more dps, but you're vulnerable to every weapon there is.just looking at the dps of the pre-nerfed myrmidon is insufficient to fully analyze its abilities compared to the other ships of eve. it's like saying all gallente ships need to be nerfed because they pump out too much dps when in close range.windjammer"
"no its saying that it was overpowered compared to the other races battlecruisers."
"i think it would be awesome if player made contributions could be included in the eve universe in a smiliar way to deadspace areas that show up on the overview. i'm talking about things like entity's museum and the graveyard of cans. they wouldn't need to be too complex, maybe in the entity example would be a station type thing that had a link to his website in its description. maybe we could even have jr's movie theatre . they would add alot to the roleplaying and adventure in eve. in short, they'd be like landmarks in real life that are just something fun to visit."
"in fleet fights, it is fairly common for fcs to have people sort their overviews alphabetically so that it's easier to find primaries. it's also pretty common to call off primaries in alphabetical order. this means that characters with names starting towards the beginning of the alphabet tend to get primaried a lot. character names are immutable and generally chosen before the player is even aware of the significance this can have on certain play styles.this is all well and good but what we really need is something more simple and intuitive:since we have filters for all the vital player ship stats, velocity, signature, transversal, distance, icon etc, it is only logical that we have one for character age as well. this will considerably speed up larger engagements and allow new players to travel from 0.0 to empire more readily. (bleh)"
"and my axe"
"this idea has nothing to do with another thread on this forum about focues fire. this is a separate discussion in which players can support this idea.basically i propose a simple fix to focused fire. not a hard limit or something like that but instead an incentive. senor strength distortionfor each target lock a ship is locked on by, it's senor strength is increased by 10%, not stacking nerfed. thus you can have 12 ships all target one ship but that ships senor strength will become so high ecm will become useless on the target giving the incentive in small gang to not just gang up on one target based on your fleets tacticssig radius distortionfor the second part of my idea there is a huge exploit i can't think of a workaround for but i'll post it anyways. for each target lock on a ship that ships sig radius is lower due to interference. this results in a slightly longer period of locking time and makes the target harder to hit.this decease in sigradis is 10% stacking nerfed, for each ship locked on to it past the 1st target.however this idea means gang mates will just lock each other before a battle, any ideas on how to get around this?well ok discuss :)"
"there is no irony to a \"confirmed scammer\" requesting this feature.it actually makes a lot of sense for someone who may find it difficult to earn the trust of others (whether new or dishonest) to want access to a more restrictive api key.it settles the fears of those who are concerned they may be giving away more information than they'd like."
"as it seems that it is not in the rules, i think it would be fair if threads started by csm members require the same as other threads started by the player base in order to reach the agenda. as some members are just posting their views and moving it through to agenda without meeting the 5% support or the support of other csm members in order to advance their own agendas on the csm, i propose that the author cannot be the one to endorse the thread onto an agenda.i would also like to propose that csm members when supporting a thread also post why they support an issue instead of saying things along the lines of \"i support this\" so that the player base can discuss with the csm why it is being brought before the council as these issues are supposed to be representative of the player base, not of individuals"
"my favorite is losing a dread because the cable company decided to shut down a segment of the network i was on to \"do some scheduled work\" and did not tell their customers.anyway, i was 35 seconds from coming out of siege when it happened and my dread never warped off after siege was over, all the modules shut off and the ship sat there. needless to say it got popped and ccp gave me the \"the logs do not show anything\" they even said sorry you didnt warp off but we cannot give you the ship back."
"tactical environments could add more \"dynamism\" to combat, create a greater sense of immersion through more interesting and realistic scenery and help make the different areas of eve universe less homogeneousi move they should be re-examined as a possible future expansion before the decade's end"
"please be more specific with what you'd like here. after all, we already have tactical environments - empty space is a boring-as-hell tactical environment, but it still qualifies as one. and if this is just a parody post with no real belief behind it, as i have a sneaking suspicion that it might be, spam the original thread, not the forum."
"there was a sticky about it from oveur on features and ideas forum for about a year and a half before it was quietly dropped (can't find it anymore, has sunk a while ago)was basically stuff like you get in deadspace, mwd not working or some mod being boosted or nerfed in different areas.tactical environments could also be thought as like the equivalent of terrain and weather. just like you have jungles or tundra as constants, you could have different set of effects, such as one region having all sensor and ew related environmentsthen you have the equivalent to sunny weather or raining or foggy being how intense various effect are and where abouts in a system or region they are strongest / weakest"
"i think i can illustrate this idea best by examples.sample tactical environments:nebula/gas cloud: targeting range -50%, scan resolution -50%, max velocity -25%. mwds disabled. afterburners +75% velocity bonus.scanners not used to picking up anything can get overwhelmed by gas clouds with their constantly-shifting patterns of interference, severely hindering them. because of the large number of energized particles, microwarpdrives cannot operate effectively and all ships are slowed down due to drag, however because of the abundance of fuel, afterburners are a lot more effective - they can burn a lot more fuel without being in any danger of running out, making them faster.asteroid field: turret falloff -50%, turret optimal range -25%, missiles may detonate randomly. kinetic resists -15%. ships and missiles moving faster than 1000m/s take kinetic damage in proportion to their speed.fighting in an asteroid field is difficult because of all the little rocks flying around. optimal range, and especially falloff range, are reduced by the large number of opportunities for a shot to get deflected or smack into a meteoroid before getting to their target. missiles are especially effected, as they will detonate on contact with a particularly large meteoroid; they're almost impossible to use at long range because of this. kinetic damage is especially effective, as ships already have to deal with asteroids bumping into them as they move, and increased kinetic damage will overwhelm their compensation systems a lot faster. things that move particularly quickly will run into trouble, or rather asteroids, which hurt quite a bit when you're moving very fast.that said, i'd love some variety. i don't think it's technically practical, but i'm going to support it because if it is, i'd like to see it."
"i started playing about a year ago and remember discovering this really cool looking mod that suks cap out of another ship. so in awe of this idea i trained energy emissions pretty much straight away. then i started looking at bhaalgoorns or well drooling mainly, but not long after ccp took away its awesome power and made it pretty average by comparison, well trickier to use. now i can see it was slightly overpowered in the first place and the nerf was perhaps needed i just think it could have been looked at more closely. something always bothered me about the nos fix and that was (i hope i'm right in saying this but it seems to be popular opinion) that it only works if the target ship has lower capacitor percentage than yours. now this seems to be a bit unbalanced why would it be % based when the mod drains a fixed integer amount based on skills, mod and ship.my suggestion would be to look at making the nos drain until the target ship has have equal or lower (actual) capacitor amounts rather than percentage based."
"i'm pretty sure the reason they chose not to go that route was that it'd be a nerf to large nos, but not so much to small or medium - they'd have little difficulty finding a target bigger than them to suck cap out of in almost the same fashion as pre-nerf, at which point the curse and pilgrim would still be the monstrosities i've heard they used to be."
"aye i see your point , but i am kinda going with the \"small ship\" idea of being able to feed off larger ships indefinitely it would be same for batleships going up against a carrier/dread. i can see how it would nerf the large nos on bss but is this a bad thing? do bses use nos that much(apart from some old school domi pilots)? i mean they only get one cycle off a frig and not much more off an average cruiser so its not a huge loss in the scheme of things? if you think about it larger ships (in pvp) usually live on lower cap resources because they use a lot more and can boost a lot quicker than a smaller ship(which don't generally fit cap boosters) so that is perhaps where i see the imbalance in that principle. smaller ships should be allowed to use nos as their capacitor input more freely."
"look at fittings for nosmyrms.i always had lower cap then the person i was fighting until they were out.if you can suck a bs down to a full bc cap.. they have no cap except for maybe one or two rounds and a pulse on the mwd.bring back nos!!!"
"how is it that nos work now?is it calculated from % amount or % recharge rate? and how do they make it so that its impossible to completely drain a target with a nos? does the nos think its target is empty when it has 100% recharge rate? does the amount the nos drain change based on the targets cap?lots of questions, but i havent found any good explonation on exactly how they work."
"actually i do not agree, nos the way it was before was monstruously unbalanced, in a gang you'd get about pretty much everyone and their mommy fitting medium to large nos.the way it is now works perfectly fine, in fact you can now balance between nos and neuts fitting and actually have an enjoyable fight."
"old nos used to suck"
"current nos is good.however!make pilgrim and curse work as old nos!"
"the problem now is not nos, i hear they work wonders with high cap use ships versus ships that do not use cap very much. the only problem is they've gone from a purely offensive weapon with a beneficial touch, to a defensive weapon.the true problem are the nos using ships. most of the fits i have seen do not even include a nosferatu system anymore."
"this won't revert nos' to its former glory it will give it a new lease of life though. i'm pretty sure its based on percentage of actual cap as opposed to the recharge rate though your right there has mysteriously never been an official explanation of how it works.i think the main problem is that you are draining 120 cap with heavy nos, a frig has 150 and if your cap is 50% in a bs his is 100% you only get 60 cap out of the frig for one cycle so it's pretty much useless in that situation. currently it only works when you are up against ships equal your size anyway. so if you make the nos drain til your cap levels are equal by number the bs vs bs works exactly the same the same and you increase the effect of the nos for smaller ships versus bigger ships giving it a use again. i really think this needs to be looked at or at least explained as the nos has gone from one extreme to the other."
"hi, i expect many people to cry out against this but i think that the lack of accountability and consequences for alts in eve is a problem that should be addressed. so my question is, should something be done?by being able to hide this way, it is near impossible to have full consequences taking certain actions in-game.there have been several threads about this already so i shouldn't need to explain further.perhaps others can think of some suggestions but here are two i remember from previous threads with some modifications:1. simply display the player's alts in the player information window. multiple accounts may be harder to do but possible.2. implement skills and abilities to perhaps track a player's activities, actions, travels in the past. the player could then check if two avatars are linked. if you are wrong 3 times, you cannot scan or check that character again. these could be higher level hacking skills or something so you couldn't create alts just to scan and check. espionage could still be viable as if done properly, a link could only be formed after discovery. ---other suggestions are welcome but the main issue is, should something be done about the lack of accountability and consequences for alts."
"speaking as an \"alt\" i disagree. from an out of character point of view, it's irritating. but you have to remember, these are all characters. why should different characters' histories cross over to each other? from a rp perspective, there's simply no reason to. ooc is the same. removal of anonymous alts would remove alot of potential in the game."
"i'm surprised you didn't just propose limiting us to one character per account.no love from me. i like keeping my alts a secret, so i have characters i can play on when i don't want to be bothered."
"well, i'm open. could you tell me about the potential it would remove? i am sure there would be some. however, removing anonymous alts may give the game more potential too, in terms of rp depth. the question - which i don't know the answer to - is would the benefits outweigh the costs, or vice-versa?"
"a market or cyno alt is very helpful to many players. they simply don't want to have to pay for that account when they no longer wish to train it.maybe offer a $2 a month charge for single alt accounts that disallow training?that is a bad idea i am sure btw."
"nope."
"the problem is that anything that it makes sense to have a friend with you, it makes sense to have an alt with you, and there is no way whatsoever to stop people from making alts under alternative player identities (you can make it a breach of eula, but you cannot stop it). i am not sure if this is solvable for an mmog."
"nope.the only issue that would be worth discussing is the use of npc corps to protect alts, but that would extend to all characters in npc corps."
"the problem i see is that ccp cannot 100% track whom multiple accounts belong to.alt tracking will be useless if they cannot tie all characters to their mutual owners."
"besides forum alts, having an alt is supposed to allow a player to do things they may want to do without having it tie back to their main.it allows freedom in a game that allows players to have many different lifestyles. if ccp allows what you're proposing, it will provide players a means to boycott alt mission runners, alt industrialists, and other alts just because one group doesn't like the group the main belongs to. (goons finding all of bob's alts and not buying their stuff/suicide ganking more targetted)having an alt allows one to take a break from activities their main is entangled in and live freely from what's happening in another part of the galaxy. as far as alt posts go, it sucks but if you prevent it by any means then you encroach on this alt freedom idea."
"first solution to the problem by the original poster should not be to drop csm, it should be next time do not vote the guys you think are only bickerers.so no support - let it run a couple of terms at least before deciding."
"i joined eve just before the end of the voting process, and was still finding my feet, so i didn't vote or have a chance to view the candidate's options.however, i still stay we give the csm a chance, and see what it's like after six months.not supportedab"
"in fleet fights, it is fairly common for fcs to have people sort their overviews alphabetically so that it's easier to find primaries. it's also pretty common to call off primaries in alphabetical order. this means that characters with names starting towards the beginning of the alphabet tend to get primaried a lot. character names are immutable and generally chosen before the player is even aware of the significance this can have on certain play styles.i don't have a particular solution in mind, but some that immediately spring to mind are:remove the ability to sort overview by name (bleh)provide some limited means to change character names, perhaps with a name change historychange the 'name' column on the overview to list ship name instead of character namechange the 'name' column on the overview to list a 'call sign' that is changeable by the player."
"i support my own post."
"supporting this, maybe you should be able to fit a module that masks your name."
"more thinking is required for your idea, young whiner.1) no, sorting the overview by name is needed for general gameplay2) no, because you can scam/change name. name history would just be abused via scammers/spys changing their name. what happens if i unknowingly change my name to an ex-scammer, god can you imagine the problems with this?3) there is already a type and sort by type function. this suffers from the same problems as point #1.4) call sign would be very exploitable don't you think. how about everyone has a call sign of 'a' or how about it is all i's and 1's like imagine saying primary is \"i1ii111iii\" secondary is \"i1ii1i11ii1\" get it?getting rid of name means getting rid of focus fire i believe. you can sort by distance doesn't work very well, sort by type is hard when there are 50 megathrons.some battles are so huge that calling targets is obsolete and you simply go through a list as fast as you can. not much of eve fights are 100+ v 100+ so this problem is very rare. you can either tank up your ship, buy a character with a name starting with z or just deal with it, but the rest of eve gameplay should not have to suffer because you are dying in fleet battles."
"no support. sorry, you picked a name starting with a. definitely do not remove the ability to sort the overview."
"i've seen that in other games - there was one age in utopia where one of the top kingdoms had nothing but zeroes and capital o's in their names, and all played the same race - trying to distinguish between 0ooo00o0oo and 0ooo00o0o0 the undeads attacking you was next to impossible, even with the third-party tools that game had. it sucked, and i don't want to have to go through that ever again. player-makable callsigns are a terrible idea."
"not signed. if you don't want people to know you're piloting a ship, fit a cloak. if you don't want to be primaried in a fleet battle, fly a prophecy."
"this is a fairly simple suggestion that would go a long way towards keeping the csm's reputation intact.reading the csm week 3 agenda, i am upset to see that almost half the agenda items were apparently added by the same people that posted them in the first place. this is not unexpected in the first weeks after the election, when candidates are trying to drum up support for the platforms that they ran on. however, i'm still bothered a bit. the two that especially bother me are item #6, which has only middling support (31 supports out of 255 posts), and especially item #9, which has almost no support (13 supports out of 56 posts) but is on the agenda anyway, which was posted by an alliance member of and cheerleader for one of the csm members.from a player's perspective, this smacks of self-service and favoritism, and i don't like it at all. this isn't an attack at the integrity of the csm members who have done this, but it does make me worry that representation here is not equal.my solution? add the following:agenda: list the following items: who posted an issue, who nominated the issue, and (optional) a reason for nominating it.csm rules: a new rule: 'you cannot nominate a thread you started unless it receives x support.' optionally, this could extend to be 'you cannot nominate a thread started by you or any members of your corp/alliance unless it receives x support.' to keep this fair, x should be a higher-than-usual number, like 50-60. this might create some problems for the goonswarm representatives, but some would argue that's probably not a bad thing. this will also raise the problem of alt-posting from particularly determined friends of the candidate, but it should cut back on it at least."
"goonies would just use alts. ;)in general i agree on the point that there should be some visibility on the listings about it. however, i am uncomfortable by the idea that there needs to be a minimum support. if it was a simple vote for support procedure, we would not need csm at all -- ccp should just look at the poll numbers directly. csm are there to put some individual perspective to it, and the solution for if we do not like any particular representatives perspective would be to not vote for them in the future (and possibly tell others why they should not, either)."
"agree with some, but not all of the post. particularly don't think the quoted section would help, unless you extend it further to 'x amount of support from people outside your corp/alliance' which isn't fair because it disenfranchises all of those people. on the other hand, without that rule, a large corp or alliance could probably very easily muster the required amount of support just by asking its members to log on and vote accordingly.i don't have an issue with candidates picking issues that they want to escalate and presenting them for vote - we had the opportunity to vote for the people we wanted, so the theory goes that what they select will be backed by the majority of the people who voted for that person. a ludicrously unpopular suggestion with the player base might still need to be presented because it has further reaching implications that forum trolls (such as me ) cannot see, which would better the game overall.provided that the candidates don't lose sight of presenting topics which have good support but which don't fall under their personal 'banner' this doesn't bother me overmuch."
"i don't think this would solve the \"problem\" that you would want it to."
"oh well, i just wanted to put the topic up for discussion, and would like to see it thought about at some point. would be nice to have some sort of check or balance, though i'm not sure what that would be (and just hacked that together as i was posting it as an example).more discussion please.and kelsin: in the spirit of discussion, why don't you think it would solve the problem?"
"isnt this why there are 9 csm members instead of one? technically you would expect the other 8 to vote down suggestions of this kind."

"indeed, and also select topics of discussion that they may feel are more worthwhile of ccp's attention.while we may not agree with the choices of other csm representatives they are entitled to bring forward whatever issues they want to.the rest of the csm can then decide if they are worthwhile or not and then ccp will get a similar opportunity"
"you are also going to see csm members supporting minor no-frills issues that receive hardly any support but are simple and easy to implement and will benefit the community."

"i think what we need to do is just figure out the common whines, and ignore them. for example, everyone has had enough about the titans *****, so if the mods just delete every titan thread and send a warning to those who start one, we might have a somewhat less congested forum."

"do we need yet another drone nerf? sweet jesus, they've beaten the hell out of the drone boats, we don't need an anti-drone ship. please, let the myrmidon die in peace."
"no, they're called smartbombs."
"agree with destroyers and smartbombs. also caldari missile boats are very effective alpha strike against drones. since they pop easy you are more concerned with high alpha to kill before they can be recalled instead of high sustained damage on the drone."
"nobody has troubble killing my drones as it is. i go thru a few million in drones every time i undock the moros. tens of millions if i launch the fighters on the thanatos. both of those ships have drone bonuses but it doesn't keep their drones safe at all.apearantly, your frustration comes from your tactical discrepancy that these others have already planned for. when they see drones they kill them. generally with tacklers, missile boats, anything with a web, and even jammers to keep me from controlling them efficiently.don't change the game, change your tactics."
"the damage bonus isnt needed at all because most drones are very, very weak. its bad enough that drones are as easy to kill as they are, remember that drones are main weapons for some ships and this ship would be like using defender missiles that actually did their job well against caldari. the ship also sounds like it could be abused for anti-interceptor purposes."
"i like hybrid solution, what drahken said is one: give the player the option to defend/not defend is wreck...also, not to kill the \"ninja salvaging\" profession, i'd like to see the wreck, and the can/loot be \"player owned/yellow\" for one hour, giving the player the right to defend it and salvaged his \"hard earned kill\"... then, after the first hour, the wreck and the can/loot become \"white/not owned\" for an aditionnal 2 hours or so...then the \"rule of thumb\" for the ninja becomes pretty much, if you can find it (the wreck) and cant wait: risk it! (your ship) ... if not wait and see!this game is all about freedom of choices, and the result of those choices!!"

"i am sorry, how are we going to get useful ideas on the agenda when you guys won't even give us official threads where we can explain the problems and concerns of changes?that is kinda like having big pharma write the medicare bill with no input from the public and claiming its been widely discussed and the public has had the chance to weigh in."
"god damn it, man, how thick-headed are you? threads in assembly hall are official."
"where we can explain the problems and concerns of changes. you cannot do that in the assembly hall threads. they're rallies, not discussions."
"slap"
"you seem to have only half read, official yes, discussions? certainly not.most of the posting in assembly is almost entirely spam in the form of /signed or simply blank posts with support checked--no one is interested in asking questions or clarifying, just shoring up hasty \"support\". is this me too syndrome a discussion by any measure?"
"i've gone through this in other posts, but the short answer is yes. look at this thread of mine, that i started specifically because gou said that there ought to be debate even on that topic - 69 replies, 68 thumbs and a \"they really should have this.\". there's no debate there, because it's essentially undebatable - it's a good idea that everybody supports. now, i'd love to get away from /signed spam, and i want to see ccp implement a system to vote without posting asap, but until we do it's a fact of assembly hall. that said, there's still plenty of discussion happening - look at this thread, that's had 139 comments in the past 24 hours, the vast majority of which were at least somewhat lengthy and debating the issue at hand. frankly, if you don't think there's enough discussion, go chip in a few comments. and if you don't think there's enough opportunity for discussion(which is really the relevant part here), then all you have to do is acknowledge the possibility of you going and chipping in a few comments. that shouldn't be too hard, right?"
"the lack of real discussion is a symptom of a whole host of problems, not something you or i can ameliorate--it exemplifies the worst aspects of an internet forum: completely unmoderated, saturated in \"me too\" posts and there's too much thread overlap. just posting more or more constructively means nothing in this context because of the volume of people spamming and structural limits of the forum. see also: monster trucks. it's a lost cause."
"its a lost cause when monster trucks get voted through the csm.thats not the same thing. lucky we've got a spam-prevention function eh?"
"i really would like to bring up the simple point once more that removing the posting from the supporting would greatly increase the effectiveness of the forum.in other words you either post to discuss or you just show support without having to spam.in other words adding a poll to each thread in the form of support or don't support.becuase really people i'm hearing both sides of the world are ending.on one had you have people saying :it's official and works perfectly\"on the other hand i hear \"nothing works it's not a discussion at all!!\"i'm sorry but i personally have been discussing threads on that forum, maybe people should just be less lazy.but lets face it not everyone has something to add some people might just think someone else's idea is great.in other words : you need both for the system to workthe system currently is allowing for discussions trust me sure there is spam but that doesn't rule out the discussions taking place. i mean even if only 5 people have posted it's still a discussion lets not start judging how many posts it should take before it counts.and currently players can show their support to the threat meaning \"i have nothing to add, i like your idea.\"the idea is to show ccp and the csm what players want brought upthe other goal is to discuss what should be brought up.thus we need both, stop saying it's not one or the other it's both, it's just not done perfectly.but ccp can't remove the ability to vote for a thread to be brought up and it would be stupid for us to have another forum for each vited in topic for nothing but discussion... or would it?either way we have to work with it this year and next year we can see what went wrong aka support = spam in between the discussions at hand. and it will be more successful."
"please note what you are currently doing by posting how badly your contradicting yourself."
"submission deadline for discussion of issues is now closed and that part of the agenda is fixed.can i remind all csm reps who took ownership of issues last time we need the formal submission templates filled out very soon as we will need to submit them to ccp by next week. at the moment i'm thinking of an extra meeting next week on thursday where we'll vote final approval on the issues from week 2/3 prior to getting them bundled off to ccp.thanks a lot!"
"i see that you have now fixed the agenda for this meeting, so now, as chairperson, can you please publicly state answers to the following:1. that presenting 60+ issues to a csm meeting as 'one topic'(science and industry) is within the rules and guidelines.2. are you going to discuss each of the 60+ issues in turn?3 is there going to be a seperate vote on each of the issues from the science and industry pdf?many thanks,arithron"
"yes. if the issue gets support and goes to the iceland agenda yes we will. nope, we'll be voting on whether the issue of \"industrial improvements\" is a matter worth raising as a whole and will be treating the 60 \"issues\" as example problems afflicting science and industry at the moment. there will be discussion with ccp if this reaches the agenda but at some point we'll be relinquishing control of the document to the powers that be and trusting them to give a substantive response to the detailed issues."
"perhaps ccp could (or be encouraged to) respond holistically to the science and industry document? so they read it over, get the general pitch, and respond in a more general sense at first so as not to get bogged down?maybe this is already how they're planning on doing it, but i guess we'll see with the first meeting."
"satisfactory, in my eyes, is that they seriously look into those things and implement the \"given\" things, some which have been scream for, for years!i by no means expect an answer to all of them 60+ issues. some of the ideas are indeed some major changes, which shouldn't be taken on lightly. but as long as they are discussed, i'm happy.edit: some things i do expect a clear comment on though. i'm happy if at least the \"most wanted\" things are covered."
"the only way they are forced to discuss and respond to issues is when each one is debated/discussed by the csm, and then voted upon in a meeting. having them all lumped together is not, as far as the guidelines and rules state, satisfying this requirement. don't get me wrong, i'm all for some love in the science and industry areas! however, you set precedents for future csm's, so it's important that everything is done correctly from the start. denying debate and discussion on separate issues by lumping them all in together isn't useful or in the spirit of what the csm was designed to do. it would be good to get a ccp ruling on this issue (presenting multiple issues for just one vote, without proper csm discussion or player discussion on individual issues...since how can you properly discuss 60+ issues in a meeting or coherently on a thread?).where do you get your definitive answer from, jade, regarding multiple issues being allowed as one issue?take care,arithron"
"and, in question 2 above i asked if you were going to discuss the 60+ issues. it appears, from your answer, that you aren't going to in a csm meeting, as required. can you explain how bypassing one of the main responsibilities of a csm is in keeping with what you were elected to do, and said you would do? this is a question to all csm members, btw...take care,arithron"
"she said they will discuss all 60 issues.can you not read? as in they will discuss all 60 issues. it's not the job of the 1st csm meetings to discuss anything. they are only voting if the issue should be taken to ccp to be discussed."
"i don't know arithron, i think in some cases it might be much better to address a collection of issues together. a great thing about this game is how every part of it touches every other part of it, so if the csm can vote on a document that addresses multiple aspects of a broad issue together, it might make a lot more sense than voting on a ton of individual bits. kind of like passing a \"package\" of laws in a legislature."
"seconded and signedas a witness of mega lag generated by the nc and trisurg wars (especially the qcwa- incident)the lag issue needs to be addressed by the eve-devs if at all possible.one suggestion ive heard from a tech friend of mine was eve should go multi threaded. helps server end lag and user end lag for multi core processorsthoughts?"
"then people will just fight without the fleet system, no reason metagaming doesn't work.also you can't nerf metagaming."
"multi-threading is only possible when the problem can be solved in parallel. computing irrational numbers, analyzing protein structures and folding behaviors and processing background radiation are all problems which can be subdivided easily, and processed in multiple threads. but think about it rationally... how could you subdivide eve's combat system? when events occur in eve's combat system, they must happen in order. for example, the 2 similar scenarios are identical except for their order of execution, but have 2 completely opposite results!scenario 1:titan starts warp attempthic tackles titantitan reaches necessary speed to warpresult: titan fails to enter warpscenario 2:titan starts warp attempttitan reaches necessary speed to warphic tackles titanresult: titan gets away (hic doesn't tackle titan until it is already in warp)if you have 2 threads computing the same engagement, but both threads produce different results, how should you reconcile the differences? which one is right? which one is wrong? this problem becomes much larger as you increase the number of interacting entities and the number of threads.multi-threading is not a silver bullet. when you have multiple threads working on the same data, you have a whole new slew of bugs and problems. resource locking, race conditions, deadlock, livelock, etc... and on top of this, you still have the same bottlenecks that a single threaded app has: memory bandwidth, i/o lag, waiting for devices, etc... the problem is that even if you multithreaded eve combat, all the threads would be trying to access the same resources (memory). the advantages of multithreading are diminished when the threads have to wait for their turn to access a resource.now, ccp will be distributing some systems of eve across multiple cpus. they have stated that when they implement rdma, market transactions and station activities will not effect out of station activities. this will hopefully help out immensely. the thing that i want to see implemented though, is dynamic node balancing. iirc, currently in order for a system to be reinforced, they have to take the node down and manually set it up to work only on a single system. if they can get dynamic node balancing working, a system could be automatically reinforced when a large fleet jumps in, without ccp intervention./edit:however, i am in full support in multithreading the client, since the client performs no vital computations in itself. i would really like it if eve didn't lock up my entire computer everytime i opened up the market window, or tried to log in."
"i endorse this proposal. let there be proper structures. it could even be a great support for ambulation, which is supposed to give us ability to walk through space stations. might as well give us the opportunity to scramble for your ships as your pos gets attacked or walk over to a factory process control center to set a new manufacturing job, or the likes. :)"

"so what are the chances of a certain module to drop when the ship is destroyed?is there information somewhere we can actually see what ccp has used to determine how they determine what modules drop and what don't? and if it is based on a random generator of some kind we can probably find out what the real chance of loot being dropped. it would help to understand what is the real risk/reward currently and what would be the projected risk/reward based on the proposal. and hey maybe we can find a middle ground? it wont make everyone happy because it is not what every one wants, and does not satisfy their \"feelings\" on the matter, but maybe able to live with it and accept that it was a balanced proposal?"
"from experience i can say that more gets destroyed than survives always, but the exact percentage is random i think as it seems to vary but never anywhere near 50% of the mods on a fully fitted ship normally 20-30%ish.so claiming that a individual item has a 50% chance of dropping is utter b****cks."

"thanks , ok so they only need another csm rep to agree with them well if that's the rule best we can do is see how ccp react if it is presented. funny thing is i'm not totally against this idea but i feel it needs to be implemented so that it isn't just made easy for the wannabe destructors and they have risks equal to the reward. again i reitirate my point of something along the lines of a titan with an outpost destroying turret that needs to be defended for a period of time until activation."
"although i agree with ikar i see this being on the agenda an abuse of power thus why i'm not voting. this has had massive amount of response and reads yet only 33 supports i think the op needs to take a look at themselves its a vanity project."
"i dunno if it has already been said, but really it comes with a bit of background with what star fraction has stood for since they began.they believe that all space should be \"free space\" and that no one should truely be able to hold space. this might be all and well and good for star fraction and other people who wish to live a nomadic lifestyle in eve, roaming around and shooting at things all over the place (burn eden for example.) but in the end, eve is a game were tons of people from all different backgrounds and playstyles come together and play for different reasons. many in the 0.0 alliances are more into the game for empire building. and the time and investment it takes to develop a region, grow it, populate it, and make it worth living in, should not be diminished either. balance changes need to be made somewhat i believe... but destructable outposts is the wrong solution to the problem of huge numbers of cap ships now in game. cap ships, and ccp's need to balance the numbers of them vs the defense of space has pushed more of the smaller raiding alliances to the back burner, making it harder for them to do damage to the 0.0 alliances. that is the problem that needs to be adressed, not destroying outposts.this gets a hearty no from house casimi.and i am in no way trying to trash on star fractions play style. it brings interesting dynamic to the game, a flavor of spice... just think you are coming up with the wrong solution to a growing problem."
"there are a massive amount of responses because people have had an intense discussion - its the nature of how this assembly hall works. hell, if somebody posts a topic nobody cares about and posts support with their alt thats a 100% record! but its the task of csm to look at these discussions and cast their support and advocacy on their conscience.this current debate is an issue that will well and truly meet the 7 day public discussion rule and show significant public support (compared to the support received for the other issues on the agenda - seriously go count). further, it was an issue that was pre-publicised during the election campaign and received support that helped me win the popular vote. say whatever you like, but one cannot deny that a) this is a hot issue, b) its has significant support, c) it has the direct advocacy of a csm rep.your allegation of \"abuse of power\" is simply incorrect. its also somewhat ridiculous to describe as a \"vanity project\" an issue that is very important to the future gameplay of thousands upon thousands of eve players who took the time to vote in the recent election.you might not like the idea, but its insulting to the intelligence of informed voters to pass off the key policy of the csm election winner as a \"vanity issue\". as this thread shows, most actual opposition is coming from a couple of people in a couple of particular alliances. but ultimately, the debate is ongoing: i've clearly expressed the question i'd like to ask ccp and the argument as to why this should be asked, what the impacts will be, and why its important to the future development of the eve 0.0 game are on record. at this stage i'm very happy to commend this issue to my fellow csm councilors and ask that we move for inclusion on the iceland agenda where we can hear directly from ccp what their opinion is on the issue. if this really was such a terrible issue and doom and gloom to all outposts and gameplay of those verbally-opposed to the idea in this thread - do you really think ccp would agree to it? have some faith please, i'm absolutely sure that ccp won't end up cutting their own throats by supporting ideas they think would be bad for the game.maybe you are wrong, maybe i'm wrong. but enough people gave their support to my election campaign prominently advocating this issue that i have a responsibility to try my hardest to ensure this question gets asked. thats all thats needed at the end of the day. if ccp say \"no thats crazy\" then thats that and we have many other issues on the agenda to move onto. i'm not going to sulk and stamp my feet if ccp say \"no\" to this, but i (and every other player that wants to hear the answer) will be disappointed if we don't get that opportunity.and at this point opportunity to ask the question is whats up for debate and decision at tomorrows csm meeting."
"hot does not mean good. people can spend lifetimes arguing about the dumbest issues. define significant support? you pushed this issue through with 16 votes. another was pushed through with 10. now, the reps can apparently do this kind of thing. ok. the case against this was made and ignored. facts ignored, testimony of those with real experience ignored. if this issue is that fantastic where are all your supporters? pages of text saying nothing makes an issue hotbutton? the game is not at a stage where this should be considered. outposts offer the chance for 0.0 growth. growth is good. more people increases the chance of fighting. knock down outposts and the game slides backwards. i have seen the growth that outposts can bring. you cannot count votes outside of this thread legitimately, it defeats the purpose of this entire forum. you cannot count votes for your office, it defeats the purpose of proposing other votes in the first place. the advocate for this topic made up his mind a year or more ago. representatives should be open to ideas, not pushing a pre conceived notion at the expense of all others."
"jade has just done what virtually every new politician does-he has over estimated the meaning of the votes he has received and perceives them as a sweeping mandate. virtually every politican that first enters office does this. they wake up one morning and say \"i won! people like me! people need me! people want to be led by me!\"they repeat this to themselves in the mirror as they shave, in the car on the way to work, in the reflection off the elevator door, in the glare off of thier desklamp. they actually begin to truly believe it. they propose vanity legislation, they jam a specific proposal or two through the process all the while believing that if they voted for me-they must want me to do this! they damn near demand it of me!then suddenly the shine comes off the pumpkin a bit. the electorate looks at the egomaniac and wonders \"where did the man of the people go\". the electorate hears a speech or reads a post or two where the once humble candidate continues to relish in his mandate to lead! and change! and champion a cause! the electorate begins to see signs of meglomania, extreme ego issues. the electorate begins to realize what they have done....and so it goes...poor jade here feels that every vote he receieved is indicative of support for his agenda. unflinching, unwavering, total committment for his specific propsals. posts, reasoned arguments, evidence to the contrary, jade cant hear it! \"the voters spoke! they believe in me!\" the fact that most voters vote with one eye open and one ear listening is lost on jade (as it is for most ego driven politicians) the fact that folks vote for names they recognize or names that seem familiar or similiar to thiers is lost on jade. the fact that most folks are disengaged and just vote for the familiar is lost on jade. every vote every vote! is a vote for jade and his platform, his agenda! he knows this as he knows his own name! there is nothing that will keep him from fulfilling his obligation to deliver to his people! his devotees among the unrepresented, the voiceless, the oppressed.either way its interesting to watch and witness. i reckon we will have to place our faith in ccp-personally i believe that ccp will not quite view jades ~2300 votes in quite the same manner as goodman jade does."
"i am sorry that no one likes your idea jade :(tbf it is a v. dumb one though"
"my primary concern about the move towards destructible outposts is balance. i dont want it to be harder for smaller alliances to make a home for themselves in 0.0. (as it is  only the overlooked or most determined seem to hold their space.) i dont want 0.0 to be depopulated through the removal of all outposts but those owned by the super powers. last of all i dont want life made easier for those who are not interested in gain or strategy, but simply want to grief and destroy for the sake of it.having said all that, it does seem realistic that outposts should have a measure of destruction available to attackers. (more than just services.) assuming it is a hard enough task to achieve  i would support the concept of derelict outposts. external and internal graphics changes to suit. no corporation ownership, anyone can dock, no fees, no services, no market etc. it can be re-claimed through gaining sovereignty and performing major / expensive repairs. that will allow players to still access their assets, and means attackers need to hold the space if they dont want others moving back into it.in conjunction, or instead  you might also look at different levels of outposts. add a level of mini outpost or super pos. basically a structure that does not show up as an outpost, can be docked at (given standings), and might have one or two station like services. it should be cheaper to build by a fair margin, but can also be destroyed. that might also encourage smaller corporations to populate 0.0."
"while i can see what you're trying to achieve, i believe it'd have an adverse effect.as has already been said (uh oh i agree with goumindong) this would simply empower the larger alliances ability to extend their power through the removal of others means to develop. if smaller alliances don't have the ability to grow for goons/ra/bob/tcf/rzr/mm/whoever showing up and whacking their outposts the moment they get them up then you won't see any changes in 0.0.well, apart from less stations.it'd be like changing boxing rules to allow killing your opponent - the people who win would still win, and they'd be removing opposition on the way.the tools provided for defenders were put in place because attacking was too easy, as it stands you can still blow up peoples ships and be a pest in 0.0, but you can't destroy anything significant unless you commit something yourself. you need to put capitals on the line for an extended period of time, and with reinforcement timers your next attack is predictable, increasing risk further if the defending force can face you.if destroying stations was viable, what would stop bob, for example, rolling up north, spending a week destroying every outpost in their way, and then going back to delve? the only thing that could possibly prevent it is that it would mean leaving delve open to attack.this would seriously harm their opponents ability to operate until they replaced those stations; and if you take into account your suggestion re: wrecked stations with intact hangars, once this process starts, you're going to end up with wrecked outposts at moon after moon in strategic systems, likely removing the ability to erect a pos, or another station at that moon.fast forward two years of this and i'm sure you can see the potential for a problem to arise.that aside, if you're not a mega-alliance, running an outpost far from highsec is not as easy as it seems once you take into account sov pos, moon mining pos to pay for the fuel for those, and for themselves, the logistics involved in moving the fuel, towers, modules, ammo, jump bridges, whatever else from empire and reaction materials back, the freighters required to do so, the capfleet required to defend it all... it adds up to a major headache if you don't have a powerful logistic structure in place.smaller alliances cannot afford to lose an outpost, this would discourage people from bothering because the potential for loss is huge. i cannot see this benefitting the little guy in any way, or encouraging anyone to move into 0.0 and would potentially lead to a monopoly of power for whoever wins the \"****-everyone-elses-outposts-before-they-pop-ours\" contest.sorry, can't support this jade."
"also jade, if you look at the votes... there are 37 yes's to this... and by far all but one or two are votes from alliances that do not have stations, so therefore wouldn't even really care if other people's stations got blown up.bad idea, it shouldn't even be on the agenda... this doesn't have support with the community on a broad basis... if it did, you would have 100+ yes votes."
"i heartily approve of this product and/or service"
"one possibility for solving the pricing issue is to use one of the running averages that they calculate for you when you flip to the graph tab in the market. then you don't have a problem with billion-isk ravens, or whatnot, unless someone's actually buying them. (... and if you sell them and then buy them from yourself, even with an alt, you still are out the 1% per price which i can't imagine is less than the amount you'll actually get as an increase in average price, unlike just putting a ton of hulls on the market.)anyway, in general, this sounds like a good idea to discuss."
"broadly support, but i think t2s still should involve more risk. maybe the payouts for insurance of t2 ships at a given insurance level be a lower percentage of assessed ship value than for t1s?"

"read more carefully in the future before you critique. it'll leave less egg on your face. i said they have few systems relative to their size. i.e. a lot of goons and relatively few systems. it points to a style of play.windjammer"
"my post was about the relationship between attackers and defenders who've had a chance to \"dig in\". goons and bob are a good example of this and that is why i used them. it's a shame you didn't realize my post wasn't just about goons. i suppose you were in too great a hurry to express your anger.the recent war between goons and bob is an ideal example of the two strategies. you had on the one hand, a large attack force bent on demolition. on the other hand you had a well dug in defender. bob had a large number of systems, well developed, compared to the number of members they had. goons had few systems, not particularly well developed, compared to the larger number of members they had. last i checked membership numbers, goons had twice as many members as bob. bob's systems are/were in one area. goons systems are/were spread all over the place.bearing the above in mind, the proposed change would benefit the style of play typified by goons and penalize the style of play typified by bob.these are not so much negative observations of goonswarm as they are accurate. it's amazing how you lot can recruit for, practice and even brag about a certain style of play and then complain when someone comments on it.merely because some of my posts are inconvenient to you does not mean they are negative or unconstructive and that's a really funny accusation coming from a goon. yeah, yeah, you're right. that last was negative, but you really earned it. enjoy. assuming i have the power to stop your discussion, reaonable or otherwise, is crediting me with far too much ability. however, i truly appreciate the compliment.regards,windjammer"

"[ i posted this originally in the \"features and ideas discussion\", it was suggested i get it into here too ]after playing eve on and off for over a year, i have collected a list of suggestions which i will lay out all together here. some of these i am sure will seem insignificant, but i think they add up in the end.system scanner:- bottom buttons should be on opposite sides - not so close to each other (accidental analyze happens to me too much) left side: analyze; middle: new scan; right: view result. this format moving the next button in line to a different location in a dialog is an excellent method of reducing user error by design.overview:- [fixed] sorting by icon does not seem to work between stations and stargates (mixed sort). example system aramachi.- overview setting seems to reset to default too easily (from saved type)edit location:- modifying a bookmark subject does not allow pressing enter to complete (must click 'ok')right click menu:- in many locations very bad options are placed next to commonly used options - for example, \"remove station from overview\" and \"dock\" in the right click station menu. these should be separated, immensly. grouping with a separator would be appropriate. group one: ship actions; two: travel; three: bookmark, info; four: overview config (remove type)- it seems that a good amount of network traffic could be cut down by adding second tier menu's to the left panel buttons, similar to the accessories button. if i could select assets->solar system when my last assets view was \"all regions\" i can avoid the all regions query.manufacturing quote:- the manufacturing quote does not show the blueprint, making screenshots less informative.- sorting corporate blueprints in the science and industry dialog by copy or me or pl doesnt seem to work properly.- display the current number of jobs processing next to max 8 (3 active)travel- reaching a waypoint manually could prompt a vocal / textual notice (waypoint reached)containers:adding buttons next to the \"icons, details, list\" buttons for sort by and stack items.jukebox:- i have music set to zero, when i open the jukebox it is always in play for which i have to click stop. it may effect nothing, but a clear \"no music\" would remove any doubt.misc:- mouse over current time for full date+time (when left panel minimized)- the tilde (perhaps only in my resolution?) is almost indistinguishable from a minus sign- solar system map: when hovering over a group of items (bookmarks, moons, planets) the list will display in non-visible location (upward overlapping edge of display)- how about some horizontal scroll bars - for example on the scanner? having to stretch the interface to see the right side is very limiting.- it would be nice to get the agent show info from the right click menu in journal->agents->missions (and perhaps also add waypoint.- can we have some ircd like commands in the chat window/join <channel> open new chat window with channel. (removing the need to open the channels & mailing lists dialog, etc). in keeping with my previous suggestion - a 2nd tier menu would be ideal, two items, the normal dialog and a text box (perhaps even a recent list).- something that would help with bookmarks is to group them by region and constellation- an option to have targeted ships remain in their position on the screen rather than roll towords the \"selected item\" box would be very helpful, especially given how laggy some systems can be.- target boxes and positional lines should be a color that is distinguishable from the tactical overlay lines- colore damage messages according to the type (incoming at least right?)- emphasize the amount of damage and attacker with bold or color offset- allow damage message window in hud (not log!) to be single line and fade outanyhow - that's my 2 cents for now.hope dev finds it useful =)-raylon"

"the csm chair's duty is to moderate and direct meetings, it is only a \"first among equals\" position with no actual additional power than an ordinary council member. the qualities of a good chairperson are not necessarily aligned with the qualities that get a representative elected. the council should be trusted to pick its own chair, it is the voters' duty to pick council members responsible enough to do so."

"this is so incredibly stupid. are you the kind of kid that got double teamed in fist fights or something? if any nerf should happen it should be a nerf to the target ship. ie. being surounded by explosions and turned into swiss cheese by projectiles and lasers should make it harder to fire acurately on the other ships."
"are you reading the post incorrectly on purpose ?notice up there where i said dreads should be able to shoot moms and titans without penalties? the purpose of the nerf is to protect smaller ships from focused fire.the numbers are obviously pulled out of my ass, so there's really no need to go ballistic over them"
"this is an awful idea.focus fire is how small skilled gangs wipe the floor with larger gangs.and how a few inty's can pick off bs's.and vice versa....sometimes .i cannot believe this has even been suggested. if you don't like getting one-volleyed in crappy 0.0 blobfests fly small gang ops to appreciate the mechanic you are complaining about.as far as storyline....if contemporary military forces can manage to correctly guage tot and dump it all in the pickle barrel...i should think things would improve quite nicely in the future as far as \"target designating\" for fleet guns.get a quality target caller and do it to your opponents ."

"i am fairly certain that my t2 bpos are safe and are going to be safe for a very long long time. invention did this thing... by devaluing some bpos and actually boosted the value of others, the combination factors altogether pretty much assure the continued existence of t2 bpos. but, just because some people are filled to the brim with the green-eyed jealousy because they do not have the t2 bpos does not bother me a bit. i have my isk.... /me pats his wallet.edit: that was a scam.... you should check the remaining runs, and it had 1.... crow would go for no less than 20-25 bill. but, they do go on sale yes, i just sold 3 bpos myself... so yea, we, the greedy t2 bpo holders sometimes sell our bpos as well."
"leave the current t2 bpos in the game. there aren't any more being given out, so no problem."
"no, there was a problem that t2 bpo owners were getting to rich. and the prices just kept climbing.this was a big issue, and the lottery wasn't able to cope with all this. so, they came up with invention to make the general public capable of building tech 2 stuff. this used to be only for a select few, now it's for the general public.but it can hardly be considered 'fair play' if you take their blueprints away. some payed a lot of money for them.and you can hardly consider them overpowered.however, i'd agree with getting a way of getting tech 2 bpo's. as in, getting the lottery re-instated. at least if one bpo gets lost, another would come back."
"actually, most people did not pay anything for the t2 bpo's they won in the lottery. others may have paid a little more to aquire them from other players. the vast majority were won, bought and traded early in this game years ago. what the op and others like him including myself would like to see is a leveling of the playing field concerning t2 invention. we're not asking that all t2 bpo's be removed from the game overnight. instead, we'd like to see them converted to max run bpc's that would retain their me and pe levels. after they are depleted, the owners would then be just like everyone else with regards to t2 invention. currently a t2 bpo is an isk making machine. the owners have made their initial investment back many many times over. it's time to even the t2 industry out. t2 bpo ownership is no different than when nano fibers and inertial stabs were nerfed because they presented an unfair advantage in the game. or when privateers exploited the war dec system which was subsequently nerfed. t2 bpo owners have little to no competition in the market place because they can always sell their product for less than the guy who had to invent his t2 bpc. i can't see why removing this advantage is any different than the two examples above, or the many examples of balancing that we've seen since day one in eve."
"the corollary to \"the falcon is fine\" is \"you're terrible.\""
"i don't believe this to be true. i would like you to provide some more numbers and arguments to back this up. a falcon with 1 x sensor booster, 6 x racial jammers and 3 x sda's and 2 x pdp rigs, jamming from 200km, will imo out perform any other recon. even when fitted with only 4 x racial jammers and 1 x sda it will jamm a 4 x bs gang 54% of the time on average. i would say that's competitive to any other recon.that leaves 3 mids, 2 lows and 2 rig slots for tank and speed mods. with 2 x polys and 2 x overdrives you will reach 2400mps."
"yes with poly carbs and od's you will hit 2400 m/s +. it also leaves you one mid slot for a tanking mod. like one lse2 or invuln2. (sb2,mwd2,lse2, 4 racials) at all lvl 5 skills with this fitting you will have 10.8/3.6/3.6/3.6 on your racial mods. max range on your racials 162+41. (and still aligns like a pig in comparison.)now if the enemy was so kind to bring one of each of the bs's yea that would be the case of locking down each one. but the % would not be as high as 54%. it would be a bit lower. the other three force recons with the same kind of fit, rapier will hit about 3500m/s, and the curse and arazu will be around 3000 and 2500 m/s respectively. each of the three ofc will have a higher dps. the rapier will be able to fit 2 lse2's and pump out about 200dps and move at about 3500 m/s. so the falcon comes close to competing with the three but falls to the bottom of the list out of the four force recons in this line of thinking of survival ability."
"compared to what?rapier and falcon alligns in 6.7sec. arazu and pilgrim alligns in 7.8sec (according to eft) i used the tier 2 bs since they are the most common,, if you consider all bs it will be 51%. the falcon is also able to fit 2 lse's and it can deal dmg from 84km. i dont see how the falcon have it any harder then the pilgrim or arazu tbh. anyway, all of the recons will die if they are primaried by a gang, none of them are fast enough to speed tank (without snakes). if the falcons get called primary all the time its because they are considered the most dangerous ships, and that should not be an argument for giving it a 200km range imo."
"possibly.if i expect falcon's...i fly twin web/twin damp rapier with leftover pre-balance damp rig. it works fine for me.in fact...i have flown that config against...pak .while not commenting on nullsec pewpew my experience in losec has been falcon's are manageable with a bit of thought. simply the act of targetting them preventing cloak is enough to send them warping off in many cases. or charging them in rapier/vagabond/whatever. or having wingmen 2 volley them in maelstroms.losec small-medium fleet combat is generally up close, personal, and not always tied to gates or other celestials leaving the falcon pilots frequently unable to show up in favorable 150km+ ranges. which leaves them open to counters previously discussed."
"an idea occurred to me recently and would like to see what the public's opinions would bethis idea was pertaining to having a special type of cyno for jump freighters and such.in much the same way that black ops ships lock onto covert cynos, i would think it would be good to have something like a \"commercial cynosural field generator\" for use with commercial ships like jump freighters. since jump freighters by their definition are a type of capital ship that can go into empire space, but the one thing that makes them different from their non jumping bretheren is the ability to jump. but as it stands now, one can jump from high sec to low sec, and low sec to low sec. but they cant jump from low-sec to high sec, or high sec to high sec.i thought why is this, i mean if one should be able to fly to high sec in normal space, why cant one jump. that idea got me thinking, while at the same time trying not to disrupt the current system with combat capable ships. it then occurred to me.having something like a \"commercial\" cyno that would be able to operate in empire, and only jumpdrives that are \"commercial\" class such as the jump freighter can lock onto them, along with what ever future commercial ships ccp puts in , in the future. this doesn't disrupt the system as it is set for combat ships, so that crowd should be happy. and at the same time this allows jump freighters to be more versatile and gives the jump system overall a larger sense of use, instead of just being \"the way you get that big dread from point a to b.\" this will allow those who can afford the jump freighters and use them to use them as best they can.i see no reason why this idea shouldn't be implemented. it doesn't break anything and only serves to add to the game and beef up the jump system as a whole.with this we will have the horse, as well as the cart.-kaiden"
"vantras, the thing is it is you who are choosing to view every proposal and action on these forums through the lens of ingame corp.all this thread is saying is that:1) the balance of shiptype used to engage in sov warfare is too far towards capital ships and should be shifted toward the use of subcaps.2) blob warfare on a single grid is annoying and lag inducing and it would be a great solution to introduce split objectives so that multiple small gangs take the place of single large fleets.3) pos logistics are a grind and constructing infrastructure has little to do with military dominance of territory.you can't seem to resist bringing ingame politics into something like that, which is puzzling because these are completely apolitical points."
"ok what stops 150 man pl, ra, goon gangs hitting the same system at once. each taking a gate. another words each gang has 150 dudes in it and the responding force is 200?"
"id be happy to leave in game politics out if i felt for a moment that star fraction and specifically jade was leaving in game politics out. his entire platform is based on his in game failures and frustrations. he is on record over and over and over indicating frustration at being unable to take out an alliance or its assets. he is frustrated by this because after many attempts he has failed. so now we have this csm program and noisy/posting jade turns into chairman jade. we have the same noise, the same posts only this time he actually has an \"official\" role. the issues are the same, jade is the same, its the format that concerns me.if i saw star fraction or jade supporting with vigor issues that were not directly in its own self interest perhaps i would feel differently. the fact that jade is willing to expend so much of his credibility to ramrod through the outpost destruction thing (by every measure a minor point compared to the general \"broken-ness\" of huge portions of eve-says much about in game vs. general state of the game motives."
"and that is the long and short of it. i can't control your feelings and perspective, and it's up to you not to bring your personal biases to the table if you feel personal biases don't belong. there's not much more to it than that. you will always see ingame politics where it doesn't exist as long as you choose to keep feeling that way."

"i suggest ships larger than frigates and cruiser size can carry multiple pods. example battlecruisers two pods and battleships three pods and so on. only one person can control the ship but the controls can be passed over if needed. i also throw in the idea of people being able to man individual fighter drones on carriers ."

"this is a good topic to discuss.personally i think it's part of the job of the csm members to initiate discussion threads and bring issues to the council to vote on. that's why we vote for particular candidates during the general election.if these people were appointed that would be different, but we vote for them based on the kinds of issues they campaign on, and in fact that's a valuable way for the electorate to impact the sorts of issues brought before ccp.besides which, if they couldn't bring issues they post, all they'd have to do is wait for someone else to post it and support it. so i don't think it would really accomplish anything to prohibit this, except to obscure the intentions of campaigning candidates."
"not a terrible idea, but i'd allow an exception for issues raised in the rep's campaign platform. if you get elected to bring up a topic, you have the right to bring that topic to the csm table without further approval. barring that, however, this is a good change."
"i think there's nothing wrong with a csm rep initiating a public discussion on a topic they are considering raising to ccp in order to gauge public interest in an issue, even though they reserve the right to bring it up anyway. the number of players choosing to show support for an issue is a useful measure for csm reps to have in order to argue for the relative importance of issues when talking to ccp. armed with that information, a csm rep can make a case (or not) for their pet issue being a genuinely important one to a segment of the playerbase. it seems very responsible of a csm rep to submit their pet issue for public comment before officially raising it at a csm meeting; csm reps shouldn't be discouraged from initiating these conversations."
"csm shouldn't start or support threads."
"while i agree that it would be against the intent of the csm for a council member to personally take an issue to ccp without the support of the players or the council, that's not what's happening here. if a rep supports an issue in the assembly hall, all that happens is that it goes on the agenda. for it to reach ccp it must get the support of the majority of reps anyway. if it's a personal issue with no support among the council, it will not progress further. requiring an additional council member to \"second\" an issue here in the forums is redundant - the assembly hall process only determines whether the council should vote on something. the functionality to combat the stated problem already exists. not supported."
"i think the problem isn't csm members authoring an idea, i think the real issue is if/when they push it onto the agenda when it does not have the required 5% support. otherwise csm are also players like everyone else with their own concerns and ideas and should be able to introduce their own ideas. however those ideas need to follow the same rules and procedures as everybody else's."
"and so far, there is no reason to believe that csm will do any good. no support."
"a while back with the old escrow system you had the ability to search by keyword, for example you could type in \"domination\" and get every domination item on contract.the new contract system's mandatory item selection is something i've always had a beef with. if i did want to search for every domination item on contracts i'd have to do a pile of searches, and that would take a while as the contract system is not the most responsive in the game.i'd like to regain the ability to search contracts just by keyword, perhaps with the option to select a specific item in a dropdown menu or something."
"/signed, on the condition that ccp doesn't think it'd be too lag-inducing. i don't think there's a single search function in this game worth a damn. contracts are hardly an exception, but even updating functionality to work like market searches would be an improvement."

"actually, if you read the csm documents, you will see that members are to discuss and debate issues put to them by players or supported by a representative (via issue thread), then to vote on each issue.jade has stated that they will discuss each issue in iceland with ccp, not that the representatives will discuss each of the 60+ issues in the csm meeting.its important to have issues seperate and not all put together, so that the representatives can clearly see the arguments for and against issue, and also see the support for an issue (not for 35 of the 65 issues etc).i agree that many issues touch on others. however, this does not mean that the procedure should be circumvented in the interests of short meetings etc. the representatives stood, knowing that it will take a considerable amount of their time. take care,arithron"
"lol do you think ccp actually read the features and discusions forum?? i dont think ive ever seen a ccp reply for anything good. is why many post their annoyances in general discussion, ships/modules and the assembly hall etc so they may just may, get looked at (but still probably wont coz ccp dont give a sh*t about important things liked crap citadel torps, the pilgrim, the nighthawk etc, which all need love. theyd all rather say \"wow ambulation is coming isnt that coooool\" )."
"i think the market system needs some more love and more features.first, when changing a market order i want to change the runtime of it too. very often i use a wrong run time, eg 24h. i don't know why the shortest order time is default anyway, most people want 90days.also i think a 5min delay for changing orders is too long, in jita i get beaten in price ten times in this time frame.i would like some more structure in my orders too. something like the market cathegories (ships, ammunition etcpp) and a search function. and please seperate buy- and sell-orders, it makes no sense to have both in one window and just wastes half of my screen.also if i see on market an item for 100isk but then i put up an buy-order for 200isk then i should get the item for 100isk, but i still pay 200isk. this is not how a market works.on the other hand it sucks to get beaten by cent-peddlers, e.g. a price war which runs like 10.000.000, then 9.999.999,99, then 9.999.999,98... either limit changes to at least 0.5% of the volume or make changing an order much more expensive.gimme!!!"

"of the 9 kill mails i have, it looks 50% is fairly accurate. will check kill mail boards right now.seems 50% loot drop is fairly common on kill mails. with variances of course where only 20-30% survive, or more then half 70-80% survive."
"i live in eve, and i actually prefer crunching the numbers the entire game is based on over mindlessly ganking and making an idiot out of myself fighting a fight based on epic fail at math on the forum. and common lore as well as the killboard sampling i just did both say the loss chance for mods on ship destruction is pretty much exactly 50%. (and please if you sample too do not count rigs as those always get destroyed and thus would skew the numbers. also do not count the lines seperating slots, rigs and cargo, easily done as those have the same color as lost items at least on our kb...)and just to waste a little education on you, how many modules a ship has fitted does in no way change the chance of an individual mod dropping. it is a 50% chance either way. to illustrate it, you can toss one coin 1000 times, and then toss that coin with 20 others 1000 times. in both cases, you will get roughly 500 heads and 500 tails from that particular coin. this actually had to be explained to another suicide ganker not too long ago as well, which does give quite an insight into you guys' understanding of game mechanics...of course there will be variance, and it might even be that you never get the good stuff, but then that is due to you having extreme bad luck, too small sample size, or both. personally i have the opposite, if i lose something and actually get to retrieve my loot, the more valuable things survive more often than not. this variance phenomenon doesn't change the base chance though."
"fixed that for ya.your coin example has nothing resembling the truth about suicide ganking and how often the high value mods drop other than on paper. your point about \"make suicide ganking more difficult!\" is really \"make suicide ganking pointless\" unless a ship is fitted with several high value isk items (500 mil - 1 bil+) or its not worth it. as any ship with the standard caldari navy stuff fitted will not be worth going after at all without insurance.think of ganking like ratting, sometimes you get a normal drop that covers your costs and maybe makes you a few mil each but now and again a high value faction rat comes along and actually drops a module that gives you a nice payday say 200 or so million each. if it was as easy and as profitable as you claim it would be going on in every high lvl mission system every day 23/7 but the fact is its not.in fact we have moved onto ganking freighters as its a bit easier if you go for those loaded with lots of varied items because of how the loot drops although it takes a lot more of us to do."
"eve really is a cold and dark world where you can get killed just for the giggles, but law paying people for whacking others under their eyes is a bit too much, yes.signed"
"/signed"
"you got that right at least. i think it wrong that people should be subject to others pretty much destroying their entire gaming experience (ab)using unreasonable game mechanics, unless these people really beg for it (like with 2 bil + setups).and your comparing ratting to suiciding shows how you really think. to you, highsec players are merely content, no different from npcs. and the only reason you fight for suiciding, spewing forth tons of failures at math and at understanding the game (or intentional lies) is so you can keep on harvesting this 'content'. personally i find that disposition disgusting, but i guess it is fairly common in eve. but while eve is supposed to be fairly harsh compared to other games, this particular harshness should not be promoted imho.the huge difference between earning money missioning any earning money suiciding is that the latter destroys other peoples fun while the former does not. so yes, imho the former should be a lot more viable than the latter at least in highsec."
"you are missing the point.if insurance is removed then so is the slight risk that mission runners with 500mil or less fittings have and that is the vast majority of them tbh.farming mission runners is already less than highly profitable if you add the time spent hunting into the equation, unless you get very lucky and get a \" uber faction spawn\" with no clue how to travel safe within minutes of setting up, and tbh in all my time that has never happened to me. in fact ive spent hours passively scanning ships only to run out of game time and log off with nothing to show for my time, and that happens a lot, a real lot actually. your problem is you only see the 10 secs it takes to kill the ship not the hours or days it can take finding a worthy target.ps: got a 24 bil freighter a few days ago but only 4 bil dropped unfortunately and we were camping that system for nearly 2 days, see how it sucks?. now if entire stacks did not all pop.........."
"i am one of the targets that these gankers target. i do not relish the idea of being that \"special\" target, but i do employ measures to make sure that i do not end up on some gankers kill mail.i am not thrilled about this. what you are pushing is the removal of the edgy part of eve that makes it what is i believe. i have been trying to get the core of what the true risk vs. reward and wanting to prove one way or another if the proposal is fair and balanced, or what the suicide gankers is doing has any real risk at all.i looked at the kill mails on battleclinic. random kill mails and found it ranged every where from 18% to 50%. no rhyme or reason for any one module nor did i see any apparent special consideration for any faction type loot that would be what the gankers are after.i perused through about 40 mails excluding the rigs, and just looking a what modules were fit at the time of destruction. and from what i have found is that it is hit and miss at best. but now reading your reply you have basically came out and said you are not after numbers nor really care. you are not looking at balance. you are looking for a one sided solution for a particular player base, yours. that is too bad really."
"/signed yes, remove insurance payouts from concord kills."
"listen to this guy.just to be clear i'm not against voiding the insurance, what i'm against is people crying for a fix when nothing is broken i'd rather not lose the insurance as its a sign that something is broken, it isn't, all thats wrong is people want bailing out instead of sorting it out for themselves, there is no easy mode in eve nor was there ever meant to be.also you need to understand that voiding insurance will never stop suicide ganking, only one thing can stop that and that's figuring out how to prevent it, which at the risk of repeating myself, again, is easy."
"well, the idea is not to stop it entirely, just to make it less profitable on 'low-profile' targets."
"a intresting issue.one once side, the ganker has already limited his risk due to insurance. and on the other the victim can do nothing since the ganker will have scanned his setup.suicide ganking should stay, but something should add the risk back to the gankers side. just now, the risk/reward balance is not really there."
"to be fair low profile targets aren't worth it, that's probably a deliberate attempt at disrupting someone due to an in game dispute where a war dec isn't an option or not preferred, or just straight forward griefing, but figuring out which is another problem as well."
"a valid point but i'd argue the time spent waiting to find the right target is in itself risk vs reward, not a real risk in the sense of word but your time waiting while you could be doing something else is already costing you isk, i've spent upwards of 3 hours plus a frequent number of times in a gang waiting for the right target that ultimately never came. i'll still argue my point that prevention is easy though and that in itself should be enough, i'd even live with no insurance because when you are selective even no insurance only hurts your return a little, but i've already said it wouldn't stop me so i don't see as a good preventative measure, the whole crux of the matter for me is that prevention is so simple."
"hey problem solved gankers don't generally go for low profile targets cause they risk losing sec status that needs to be regained from hours of ratting."
"actually it is more likely that our definitions of low-profile targets are quite different. an entirely navy fit cnr with not a single deadspace mod is a low profile target imho, yet under the current system would be profitable to suicide. and that is what i think is wrong."
"your right that our views differ on low profile targets, our gangs certainly wouldn't gank that type of ship, if no insurance prevented those types of ganks then i'll support it, theres a lot of suicide ganks happening and i'm not doing it atm because people are getting wise and its a lot harder to find the right target, so it's in my intrest to stop it asap.but once again i'll argue that prevention is easy."
"remove insurance - remove zero cost ganking. far as i'm concerned, remove it entirely from the game."
"why remove it from the game?work as a team, have fun finding and implementing solutions and put the m in multi player.you can run missions solo and make isk but the game is a mmo and sooner or later you're going to have to make friends to move on in the game."
"this part is debatable, you seem to think it is important to the gameplay lots of other people don't. i don't think it's important but i do think having something indestructible is incongruous to the sandbox environment this is something i agree with you on funnily enough. the reason i am withholding a vote and castigating here is the methods you have used to push it and i don't think the answer to outposts should be destructable \"just cause\" is a good argument cause really at the end of all the walls of text you have presented that's been your most coherent argument.i mean i like big explosions as much as the next person but players also seem to think turning titan mods into monster trucks is just as good an idea as yours (in fact it has received more supports)."
"i cannot support this. if you're going to conquer, you must take on the responsibilities of that action. outposts offer a spot to rest and recoup when you're far from a friendly pos. without outposts, all you can do is run, run, run till the baddy takes your ship keys away.as long as outposts are conquerable, but not destructable, the losing side can take their time to sell the assets they may have stored in the outpost. make the outpost destructable and the losing side either faces the ugly end of a fire sale or wholesale loss. the assumption i'm making here is that if the loser lost the outpost in the first place, they're not going to have the fire power to extract their stuff in one piece inside 72 hours or perhaps never. nor are any of the other people who may have their stuff stored there.eve and the sandbox aren't just about pew pew. they're about building things that endure. they're about pvp and about setting down roots to say, \"this is mine and it's going to cost you to take it and still more to keep it.\" yeah, even in 0.0. building an outpost is still not a lightweight consideration for anyone. there's the initial effort to build it and also the knowledge that you could lose it to an enemy who could then use it against you. strategic decisions not to be taken lightly.i should save this post to show goons. some of them say i post against everything they want. here i am agreeing with at least one goon. to use the favorite phrase of a prominent goon, this is \"counter intuitive\".best regards,windjammer"
"because there are less stations.wait, so you shot a station service and it was taking a long time and the conclusion you reached was \"lets be able to destroy stations\" instead of \"hey, maybe these things have too many hit points\"?because the enemy uses the station as staging ground to get new ships, fit them, and then attack you with them.here is a good example. when fighting smash in bwf, we lost the field on a gate because smash could keep warping to the station, docking and repairing if they got out, getting new ships when they were destroyed or podded. we took down repair services, cloning, and fitting. podded pilots could no longer clone into that same station and get into the fight without risking huge penalties. pilots low on isk could not use the insurance money to purchase and fit more hulls. pilots with ships fit in sub-prime ways could not refit. pilots could not repair their ships easily and cheaply.if they wanted to get back those abilities they needed to put carriers on the line. if they tried to stage ships in the area they couldn't get them from the station they had to move them unfit out of the station to a pos to fit(and leaving ships in a pos is much more risky)no, the buffer zones would make attacking for either side sufficiently hard that no serious assault could be reached on either side. the people who would lose are the ones who might use the interim space. and anyone who wants to attack gs or bob.just to avoid the inevitable ad-hominem you will launch here. i say this as someone who has directly participated in a multiple region sovereignty war on both sides of the conflict. in -v- when they didn't have a buffer zone against gs and ra and in gs when bob did. as well as someone with a backround in examining these types of situations.well then, now that we have established that cva is not stupid, why in the world should cultivation so that their corps and alliances they foster might go on to bigger and better things be a bad thing? maybe if the people who want to change the rules so that they can accomplish the gaols they are unable to do without whining to ccp would engender a little good will they wouldn't be sitting in empire with thumbs up their butts, they would be living in their free space utopia. their in-ability to enforce neutrality and cvas ability to enforce their will only means that cva is stronger and better at the game, not that we need to change the rules.cva fights for the little guy, so has goonswarm(though in a different way). that the little guys like the guys that help them more than the people don't is irrelevant to the discussion."
"what thousands of players in roving pvp alliances/corporations/pirate outfits? they way it looks here its as if there are 3 of you.you don't have to. you can take the station and then deny all docking rights. that is as good as destroying it.a note: none of this has been empirical. empirical evidence is evidence that comes from repeated controlled tests and repeated observations. anecdotal evidence is the singular form of empirical evidence with no control. what we have here is pure logic. unfortunately we cannot have empirical evidence in eve until its too late. though we can certainly have empirical evidence of what happens when its too late[titans, motherships, pos without guns outside of them, etc]you can already lose it. it just isn't destroyed, its captured.only if you are too foolish to exploit what the station services being down means. if you know they are going to bring carriers out and rep it, prepare and kill the carriers. if they don't then you are causing them lasting financial damage since they can't use the station to clone, rep, and fit ships[which reduces the value of the market which is financial damage]impossible. the value of the outpost is relative to the time it has been around to accumulate assets and market activity as well as its ability to provide a logistics base. there isn't really anything balanced you could possibly add to increase its value since its value is so hinged on having been there.no. as long as there is an advantage in owning and outpost that outweighs the cost people will build them. if you reduce the advantage and increase the costs you are very likely to increase the cost and decrease the value to the point its not worth building.destructability can be part of the risk-reward equation, but it does not have to be and that does not mean it should be.in one of the threads(i think it was jade's candidacy thread) and/or chatlogs darius johnson has said that this is exactly the sort of thing we would do given the chance. i have no reason to doubt him."
"you didn't answer the comment. saying that balance is an important issue doesn't make this balance an important issue.all the descriptive things you mentioned already exist. and introducing more options is not always good for a game. a good example would be nge for swg, titans in eve, etc. you mist make an argument for what this new feature is good for the game. it is not axiomatic that it does.1. no it does not. establishing an outpost requires sieging a system and putting the egg down. we aren't. where the hell did this come from?unfortunately for you destroying stations will make it easier for territory holders to reduce their borders and concentrate defense. a new alliance will not find it any easier to defend their space but an existing alliance will find more value in destroying a new alliance rather than leaving them there where they can get powerful.if you can't defend it what makes you think they can take it? at the moment only an idiot would run away from their space and attempt to come back later when tenants have been established. and now the attackers don't even have to establish tenants who might lose the space. clearly one fight is more pvp than two fights! i like your logic jade."
"you only have a lot of experience failing in 0.0. not succeeding. this if of large importance when you claim that this experience makes you uniquely able to judge how large 0.0 alliances will act. clearly the way you think the would act is wrong, if it were not you would be successful in 0.0 politics instead of a failure.furthermore. security is a payoff and everything can have direct valuation in isk[though not everything is easy to value]. ergo any security benefit is a direct isk benefit to an alliance.furthermore. darius johnson who not only has experience in 0.0 but experience being successful in 0.0 is on the record for the opposite(though i can't find the quote)kelsin, you're trying you exaggerate an argument to make the opposing side look ridiculous, then argue against the strawman and claim you're right. don't you see how using a logical fallacy doesn't support the secnario you're defending?furthermore, he is not wrong, the occasion when we conquered an outpost to use as a strategic launchpad to continue a campaign is an occasion where the enemy would have destroyed an outpost to prevent the enemy from using it as a strategic launchpad to continue a campaign. the discontinuation of the campaign and increased costs of continuing it would have decreased the turn over rate of space. in this example we might not have ever been able to make a run at delve, leaving that area in stagnation.and i would like to not waste their time on the hemming and hawing of an impotent empire alliance and their dear leader."
"booo no way! this idea sucks!! thumbs down.and what happens when an alaince has one station left, has billions upon billions of assets in said station and it gets popped?that allaince (most likley small) gets un-politely skull-f*cked, gets kicked outta 0.0 (almost permanantly for the time ittl take to get back) and many ppl may quit the game as theyve lost everything (including their clones).ive seen ppl nearly quit over losing a marauder, imagine if they lost several cap ships, t2 ships and modules? no to this proposal"
"although i think you're bat**** crazy i actually agree with you on this.i know some alliances would roam about space burning regions at a time simply to neutralize it but frankly, i want to play that eve. i play eve over other mmos because of its sandbox and free nature, because everything in it can be destroyed and rebuilt indefinitely. i don't believe more and more outposts should crop up over all over 0.0 in a recurring mass orgy of stations, there needs to be a control mechanism.that said, it should to be extremely hard to pull off (and possibly resource expensive as well)."
"in the op the solution i suggest as a rough proposal has personal hangers surviving the destruction of the outpost and continuing to be accessible from the derelict that remains in space. (clones would be moved elsewhere obviously)."
"and again, the proposal in the op has personal hangers surviving the outpost explosion that will continue to be accessible from the derelict remaining. no docking restrictions - this stuff will be there to be recovered at a time force can be assembled to do the recovery."
"if they could come back and seige the system long enough to get freighters worth of stuff out of a derelict outpost then they could have retaken said system most likely. we are talking about moving freighters of stuff out. you couldn't afford anything smaller as you would need everyone defending you could get."
"i'm stoopid. forgot to check the \"i support this\" box."

"currently there is a very very lucrative farming method occuring within certain constellations in eve. threads have been written about it (though none i can find in this forum), disgust expressed, etc. i refer here to the cosmos radar site.1. unlike most exploration sites cosmos radar always respawn in the same constellation, right after downtime. farmers who use these sites find the site very quickly after dt and run it, leaving a cloaked ship inside the complex to prevent it from respawning. 2. the site can be run without killing the npc's, because the gates are not locked. the final room is usually avoided, cutting off much of eve from getting the semi-useful drug bpc's that reside there. the second to the last room is the one farmed. 3. because these sites *rarely* spawn outside of cosmos constellations the resident farmers can use the considerable wealth they've accumulated to protect their operations/monopoly by any and every means possible.-------------------------------------------------------------------solutions have also been posted before (and include but are not limited to):1. disable cloaking devices within any deadspace complex.2. increase difficulty of this particular complex and include the usual lock gate until all rats are killed rule that applies to the rest of the complexes in eve. also move the most valuable loot drops to the last room, where the drug bpc's drop also. this would increase their usage even if this plex was farmed.3. decrease the spawn rate within cosmos constellations to 50%. ie 50% chance you'd still get this complex to spawn in that constellation, and 50% chance it'd spawn somewhere else in eve altogether. i think the current spawn rate for 'the rest of eve' getting this plex is around 5-10%. if this particular topic has already been brought up you have my apologies in advance, but i'm at work and only had time to look at the first three pages."

"if the drone mods are made highslot modules, that gives you the option for a true droneboat. fit one gun for aggro, and then drone modules in the rest of the highs, to improve damage, etc. take a regular fit, but without guns and with more drone damage to match current damage output, guns + drones."
"i think as long as there is an exchange of a highslot, or something of that nature, you should be able to boost bandwidth for larger drones in space, i just want that 4th and 5th ogre ii on my myrmidon again :) even if it costs me 2 highslots and 200 to 400 pg, each, that balances out the dmg from what whould have been guns. subject as a whole supported, but major support to anything that gets me my heavys back."
"hello,i have spent some time thinking on this aswell. i have exploration experience mainly in 0.0 space. i came to notice that even a very well tanked battleship could get in trouble while clearing the sites. i am ofcourse refering to radar/magnometric sites not combat anomalies or complexes. in fact i can run lvl 4 missions without breaking in sweat, but more then offen some radar sites have forced me to warp out. some may say that the good stuff such as meta drone bpc's shouldn't be that easy to get (btw yes i do live in the drone regions), and i fully agree with that. a cruiser sized ship would need some crazy tank bonuses to last through one of them radar sites in the drone regions, hence making it virtualy worthless. i haven't spent much time exploring outside of drone space, however i could imagine that sites are equaly dificult across 0.0 space. however it is exactly 0.0 space wich demands an exploration specialst. a ship that can drop the probes and find whatever's hidden but also that can survive the guardians and loot the contents.i was thinking of atleast a battlecruiser sized ship or even larger. yes some of you may think a battleship sized exploration craft is bit of an overkill, but i beg to differ. it is only the battleship class wich offers all what an explorer's heart griefs for :1. protection2. large cargoholdand 3. the firepower to clear them rats for good.in fact, it is only the inherently low speed and agility that speaks against an exploration battleship. and yes i fully agree. it is up to the individual explorers to make sure that they are not piloting towards gate camps or warzones. for that matter nothing can surpass the survivability of an nanoed, stealthy frigate.what i had in mind was what i called \"the science vessel\" (yeah i love starcraft :p). battleship sized, striped of most (if not all) turret/launcher hardpoints, using drones to fight its way through any exploration site. heavy tank and a decent cargo hold to store enough probes and valuable loot from the exploration sites."

"before we get down to the nitty gritty suggestions, a brief preamble on why some think roleplay in eve is important, relevant and worthy of ccp attention.the nature of how eve functions, where you have one person living in the same universe as any other, has had a profound impact on what roleplay actually means in eve online. it is quite unique and different from almost every other mmorpg out there. it has taken some time, but the wider eve community i think, is beginning to realize that eve roleplayers are an entirely different breed of animal to the roleplayers they may have seen in the past. for their own part, many roleplayers dont even consider themselves as such. they reject the rper/non-rper dichotomy entirely, saying that in a game such as eve, where everyone is effectively playing a role, such a categorization is meaningless. this is the nature of rp in eve. various entities with rp inclinations have stood up on the big boys stage and proven that their roleplay can work successfully within the greater in-game framework and not automatically render them irrelevant. this is another part of what makes it so unique. there is no roleplayers shard, they occupy the same space as non-roleplayers and they have to fight as hard as any other group to become successful and relevant. at times, due to the self-imposed limitations their roleplay brings, they have to fight even harder. roleplay in eve is far more than simply lounging in bars discussing holoreels  it has consequence and adds context and meaning to fights. you cannot roleplay a hotshot combat pilot if you dont have the skills to back it up  people will simply ignore you or worse yet, call you on it and splatter you across the space pavement. roleplay in eve functions in a similar way to the political machinations of nullsec alliances; there is intrigue, drama and a narrative that grounds (and provides motivations for) ingame actions and everything in between. the only difference is roleplay derives that from the eve online backstory, in addition to player actions (which is what the usual nullsec alliance draws from exclusively). with the onset of factional warfare, there is a huge opportunity to build upon what will likely be a growing interest in eves already rich backstory. as the storyline becomes increasingly integrated into actual gameplay and gameplay mechanics, so too will it be worthy of an appropriately increased priority in terms of ccps resource allocation. right now, there are major roleplay elements taking centre stage with this new expansion. given this, there are those who think it a fitting time for ccp to consider and reconsider various roleplay issues in their game. ccp can pioneer new levels of storyline and player interaction here, and become even more than it is now, the envy of the mmorpg industry.there are countless ways to improve the storyline, its presentation and its accessibility. these range from the most minor of things to big and bold ideas. the majority of the points outlined below are suggestions aimed at doing just that. the list of issues below touch on some key points, but the list is by no means exhaustive. anyone with any further input or suggestions is encouraged to add to them. these points were compiled by various people who frequent the chatsubo forum community, where roleplay is discussed at length and with passion."
"small things:  news request; incorporate player entities more openly: it would be nice to see npc bodies/factions/etc reacting a little bit more to player actions; for ready example, the republic actually making public their stance on ushra'khan activities. silly little news article stuff like that would make a big, big difference to the living, breathing feel of the game world. in-game racial channel motds encouraging roleplay: you could also ask if the empire channels could get some form of isd monitoring, or at the very least, an motd stating that whilst the channel is for general use, ic interaction is encouraged and preferred. eon chronicles made public retrospectively: i'm not sure whether they're doing this already, but would it be possible for fiction appearing in eon to appear in the library a few months later? adding roleplay as a corporate recruitment filter: give us roleplaying as a filtering option for the corporate recruitment mechanic. yes, its an ooc category. yes it encourages the mindset of a rp/ooc divide. if you ask me, that is a small price to pay for getting more people seeking rp in touch with the right people. once theyre inducted they can learn how rp in eve is so different that the category is almost void of meaning."
"big things:  wrapping up long-unfinished arcs: it would be nice to see some of the unfinished arcs finally finished off - tetrimon, vitoc cure, amarr emperor and so on. events and story arcs; adding player influence and making them dynamic: let players completely influence the story. give them the opportunity to. have heth riding around in a titan some day doing fleet reviews. if the people who hate heth can manage to come in and kill him, then he's dead. any plot that is planned has ways for players to get involved and totally rewrite the plot with their actions. that would be my dream state, though i know it is likely not to be even considered. player influence and dynamic events (version 2.0): a slightly toned down version of the above. let us influence the storylines. the more our characters become relevant and integrated into gameplay, the more roleplay benefits as a whole. its looking like fw might let us do these things to some extent, so i have hope. even if its not to the extent where we can kill the main players, letting us alter the main story in smaller (yet still significant) ways would draw a lot of interest. who wouldnt like to be part of the corporation that single-handedly ended the reign of a some local system dictator or some such?  fixing the news system, issues and suggestions: fix the news system. better yet, rework it entirely. at least fix it though because its pretty damn broken at this point in time. as one of the more important delivery systems for roleplay/fiction events, it really needs it. there is no igb support beyond the headlines and the stories there change so rapidly at times (like right now) that if you dont log in once every day or two, you need to go to the news site oog to catch up on whats happening. then, when you go to the oog site, articles that are weeks old (sometimes even just days when its busy) slip off the news page andinto oblivion. archives are non-existent. you are reliant on an rss feed workaround which is really clunky. very old articles do not even display on the eve site anymore. at the very least, restore the functionality we once had. at the very most, sex it up greatly. its an opportunity to really beef up and sex up roleplay and factional warfare. if storyline is going to become a focus for the foreseeable future, why do we have so much of it delivered in such a woeful medium?  forum reorganization: reorganise the forums to better facilitate in-character interaction. have an entire roleplay (or whatever you want to call it) section with: igs / cas / library / stories (that section would be new) section. maybe rename the cas so that its fw-oriented and used for that purpose (and have any npcs you have for fw [i hope!] do their announcements there)  more chronicles: more chronicles! surely there are others in ccp who want to write stuff? no? get the community to write again then!  more in-game description content: more descriptions! systems / planets / stations / channels / items / etcyou get the idea. ccp doesnt have the time for these things? get the community to!"
"using the community to advance rp interests and enrich the game: use the community more. not just the rp community but really the wider eve community. its a vast and almost entirely unexploited resource. just because you ask people to submit descriptions, chronicles, whatever doesnt tie you down to actually using them. make that much abundantly clear and then open the floodgates. if people could add a little piece of themselves to the game, it makes them feel that much more invested in eve. thousands of playersthats potentially thousands of submissions. dont think youll get an overwhelming response? offer ingame prizes (neednt be isk, just something unique even, something prestigious). offer oog rewards perhaps, for people who submit a lot of stuff (eon magazine, signed piece of concept art, merchandise, you get the idea) getting some basic rp facts established: how about regular dev chats were people can ask questions about pf and get straight answers. or beyond this, just facts about the world. you don't need to detail every single tribal custom of the minmatar. but giving three or four for each tribe would be lovely. and there are things where player creativity has no role in things. the number, names, and reigns of the amarr emperors. past federation presidents. population numbers. these things are important for those who take an interest in eves already-rich backstory.  make the universe have more influence in game terms: for example, an amarr & minmatar cooperation should be made more difficult, given the difference of cultures, with the loss of a variety of bonuses...  piracy and fight against piracy need a revamp to allow roles to exist: for example, when an anti-pirate corporation attacks and hunt pirates, they loose security status, are attacked by sentry guns and can be seen as pirates themselves... so we need better rules to order this somehow, for example that attacking a lower security status than you doesn't lower your ss and so forth... proposed solution: bring the ded connections skill into the game, but instead of paying out extra bounty for npc kills, make it decrease the threshold at which an enemy can be considered an outlaw. so with level 1 in the skill, you can freely shoot at someone who's at -4 sec standing, at level 2 the threshold is -3, until finally at level 5, anyone with a negative sec rating at all is fair game. if that's a bit too tough on the \"minor offenders\", you could also make it so that this kind of vigilantism is accepted only in low security space.  one should be able to join npc corporations with a good value added. for example, a player should be able to join empire's navies. he would receive missions, fly alongside other navy ships, etc. should he not comply, he would be dismissed from the navy (joining a navy have its needs)."
"some very good ideas and suggestions there. i agree its a valid topic for csm discussion under a general heading of \"promoting roleplay in eve online\" - it probably needs to be coupled with rodj blakes thread: hererodj talks about the specific problem of unfinished storylines with amarrian roleplay but its obviously a general issue with all storylines.anyway, supported!"
"signed"
"cheers for bringing that to my attention jade.frankly a lot of things (like the issue rodj raised) are worthy of their own thread, but in the interests of not spamming the hell out of these forums, a list of \"roleplay issues\" is probably the best way to go."
"now this is definately a very good ideia.great one kai."
"indeed, descriptions. that would make it a little easier to decide where my character was born and grew up, or where he would like to live, where i could live even.also, i'm playing a 27 year old, but the \"birthdate\" says otherwise. could this be changed to \"graduation date\"or something. and while i'm at it, set the ingame clock to est (110 instead of 2008), or at least create an option to do so, or have a place where you can find the est date easily.

"i'd like to play devil's advocate and just put some across some counterpoints for the sake of balanceimmersion =/= roleplayto become immersed in a game does not necessarily mean that you can't recognise the virtual world in which you are engaging in as being fake, artificial and/or not a true reflection of some reality (made up or otherwise).many people get immersed in the social interactions or learning experience of playing a game without necessarily diving headlong into the prime fiction and background of the game. that is to say, i don't have to pretend to be someone else and suspend my own character in favour of some imaginary or pretend one that i control in the game to necessarily get fully immersed in what i'm doing in the gameprime fiction is artificialthe second argument is that the prime fiction of the eve universe, the stories andf background histories etc don't actually match up to the game mechanics.overemphasis on roleplay derived from the backstory and fiction of the eve universe has always been a problem for me. how to i translate the story and background of my character into actual actions and events that have an impact on the game universe?fact is, all to often, roleplay in eve really is pen and paper, writing stories and filling out characters, having debates about various topics like slavery or the latest machinations of the caldari state or something.these things have very little basis in the actual realities of the game. thus for most players, the most real experience is the 0.0 experience of epic battles and intrigue and slavery is relegated to an npc trade good itemthe argument is thus that actually ccp are justified in having the vast emphasis on 0.0, pvp and conflict therein that they dothe game does not reflect the universe's backstory but rather the other way around. thus to try and change that would need a major game redesign and that isn't feasiblecommercial interestthere is a certain commercial interest in not emphasising the roleplay aspects of a game such as eve. it can be split into two parts:target audience:eve is not aimed at the classic nerdy roleplayer (percieved or otherwise). rather there are far more people who are interested and excited about eve for what it represents in the mmo market.in contrast to a game such as wow that does not take itself too seriously and thus appeals to a wide audience, eve online caters to a niche in the mmo market for something more extreme or hardcore. the actions of the players have a persistant and often large effect on the game universe in the markets, in 0.0 and soon in low sec with factional warfare. eve is a \"cold dark place\" and as such some things are made unrealistically extreme, such as the legal system. there is no accountability nor trust in the game, two important aspects of security needed to build businesses or empires. and it has been stated by many, both players and devs that this is the reason many playto try to improve roleplay and background/storyline etc of eve would require making things more realistic (like say having customs police chase you) and that would be detrimental to the game and what it is all aboutcost:there are costs involved with writing the background fiction, filling out the eve universe and creating events that players can be a part of and have significant impact on the game universethe 0.0 sandbox system as well as upcoming fw expansion mean that the storylines write themselves. there are no artificial game masters controlling everything and everyone else being on a rollercoasterto try and put that in as a separate layer and as already described not bring that great a benefit anyway and be very time expensive. (why do you think the game continued to grow so much despite having little to no aurora storylines / arcs for ages)"
"controlccp need to be able to exercise a certain level of control over their product. if it were genuinely possible for an entire npc faction to be wiped out because of the actions of players in the game, then all the work to do with that factions background and story, all their ships etc become essentially wasted effort on the part of the dev teamhowever, having said all that, i'd still like to see more attention for roleplay concerns, even if i think that ccp would be better off just admitting the whole thing is a farce and getting out in the open what the game is really all about"
"in general ccp needs to look at the resources they put towards their background as it becomes a larger part of the game itself. it doesn't need to be on the scale that the pen & paper companies do it, but it should probably be equal to a pnp core source book (shadowrun's corebook, d&d's eberron & forgotten realms corebooks, serenity rpg corebook, etc)."
"supported (and nicely written)."
"spoon, thanks for the input. you raise some good points which ill try to address. i will say first however, that most of what youve said doesnt actually contradict the majority of ideas proposed above. ill get into that as i go along though. on immersion =/= roleplay: i absolutely agree, i think any rational person would. theres far more to immersion than simply immersion in the roleplay elements. i hope you dont get the wrong idea from me questioning how this is relevant, however. nobody is suggesting that immersion via roleplay take primacy over those other, more important elements. i believe the general consensus is more simply that it should be bumped up a notch.prime fiction is artificial: it seems here, that youre using the term artificial to mean not integrated into gameplay. its certainly true that a great deal of the backstory/prime fiction elements are not manifested in in-game mechanics. however, prime fiction and backstory is just one part of roleplay. if you buy into the mindset that each and every person playing eve is essentially playing one role or another, and thus, roleplaying to at least some extent, then you will likely also view fiction and backstory as a minor part of roleplay. in many ways it is. that isnt the whole story however. if you hold that player interaction and action is the important stuff when it comes to roleplay in eve, then you have to also account for the role that prime fiction plays in influencing such things. pf enriches player interaction and motivation. if the sum total of amarrian pf to date was simply the two statements: they are religious. they enslave minmatar. then would cva even exist at all? if they did, would they have chosen to expand the empires reach into providence? i seriously doubt it. the motivations your own alliance has to behave in the way it does are, in part, drawn directly from the rich backstory of the amarrian empire. a group like cva could have lived in a far more profitable region, that you chose providence of all places is testament to the role prime fiction / backstory can play in influencing player (and character) decisions. you say that the most real experience is the 0.0 experience of epic battles. youre probably pretty close to the mark there (at least for a significant amount of people, anyhow). the thing to remember however, is that:a) all of those battles can be framed in a way that doesnt disassociate them from roleplaying entirely. sirmolle plays the role of space tyrant, goons play the role of anti-authority upstarts making the unkillable beast bleed. this is stuff no content department could ever write as well as the players do each day with their actions. this stuff, this rich tapestry that players weave daily with their own actions, it is a prime fiction in and of itself. cva is as much an ingame reality as ishukone. neither is more real than the other in rp terms. b) some of those battles are actually overtly framed in roleplay terms. your own alliance is the very best example of this. youre doing more than simply fighting over territory, the glory of the empire is at stake. theres a more complex context and a deeper meaning to your battles than there is for most. many in your alliance make a conscious and considerable effort to bring that out. so yeah, i see your point. however, a more broad definition of what constitutes roleplay means that those concerns you have are entirely dealt with. (its kind of odd actually. i almost dropped cvas name in that preamble, when i was talking about how roleplay alliances have walked the walked with the big boys, and shown how rp is more than just pen and paper stuff. your alliance is a shining example of this mindset. now i have someone in cva arguing it! :p)"
"this ties into your other point regarding commercial interest. when you broaden the definition of what roleplay is  in a nutshell, something everyone engages in on some level  then anything that benefits rp benefits everyone. that said, some people dont agree with that definition, and even those who do have to concede the point that even if everyone roleplays, many people wont appreciate resources going into beefing out the backstory when it could have been allocated to other things. if people only roleplay to an extent then things that benefit rp will only benefit them to an extent as well. any consideration on ccps behalf about ways to further rp in eve needs to take this into account. for my own part, i want to see rp and the rest of stuff become integrated to the point where any categorization is essentially meaningless and it becomes harder  for everyone involved  to distinguish between the two. if we can already frame everything in a very loose definition of roleplay, then there is arguably the possibility to achieve this over time. anyways, i hope that cleared a few things up. i should probably emphasise at this point that i only speak for myself here."
"i'd not describe myself as a rper, but that's because i've not had the chance. i read the news stories and think 'wouldn't it be cool to be involved in that?'the idea of freeing a system from a dictator/killing a pirate boss etc has been done befor by ccp. i wish it was done more often and on a wider scale.who doesn't like thier name in the news?"
"definitely signed."
"the cost would be okay if they actually killed thinga. like, they seem designed to tip the scales in a big battle, where doing smallish amounts of damage to many people could give victory to the other side. except that in larger battles it is impossible to use bombs effectively because of game limitations. the explosion radius is stupid as well. as it is, i can't even kill frigates with them. it's hard to believe that one bomb used to cost about as much as a doomsday. perhaps they are made with cruisers in mind, but you can't kill t2 cruisers or drones or fighters or really anything with a bomb.more varieties could be good. half damage but double area of effect would remove some of the impossible aspects of precise usage. perhaps well-balanced t2 options would be okay. as it is, they're just stupid."
"bombs are like bubbles they can only be used in 0.0 truly a useless anti blob tool..."
"seems to me that the guys here are looking for a weapon that can insta pop friggies and bigger but also requires no real skill to use or deploy. what would be the point of flying anything but a bomber if bombs could not be out run or avoided?..... not a lot tbh.get skilled up, learn how to pvp and stop looking for easy solutions."
"that is not what i suggested.the issue with bombs is that they are currently utterly useless, and are not used at all.bombs, in theory, should be another good tool for breaking up bc/bs blobs, but sadly they would never pose a threat in their current forum.i presume ccp wanted these things to be useful and if so they need some boost, but of course not an i-win-button.for the record i have field tested them many times and have also had them used against me."
"yes please"
"do it"
"fantastic idea."
"general lee horn upon dd activation plz"
"i have to laugh at this. during the csm round table discussion at fanfest 2007, this was debated by experienced guest speaker as one of the key reasons why a council could only ever recommend, and ccp would always have decision power.the example cited was that players would request \"pink ponies\". guess you now have a name for your next titan monster truck - \"pink pony\"."
"build marauders. no t2 bpos exist. invent and build other items where demand far outweighs supply from bpos. honestly as long as you aren't trying to make something like ammo the t2 bpo effect is negligible or nearly so simply because there are more people buying items than can be made from in game bpos.not supported. though a better return on me and pe of invention jobs based of t1 bpo they are made from would help. -8 me is frigging ridiculous. :shakes fist:"
"how is living in 2006?try doing a little math before sprouting sentences that were valid 2 years ago.before saying that the t2 bpo aren't traded and that the current owners have already get back the investment, look the sell order section of the forum, you will find several t2 bpo traded every day, for a cost equivalent to not less than 2 year of constant production."
"venkul & other sensible folk, there is no arguing with people like that, really. all they are concerned about is the gnawing feeling they have at the pit of their stomach every time they see someone who has an ability to purchase the t2 bpo, or already has one. what they really want to do is bring everyone and everything to their level, since they do not have it, unable to get it, and would not get it, they feel they need to make it \"fair.\"just ignore them, it is not worth arguing with people who have no concept."
"delete"
"you can buy one with enough isk when they get sold so id hardly call that not available ever and having zero options tbqh."
"it pains me to see people who probably own t2 bpo's, who probably backed the privateer war dec nerf, who probably whined about the advantages the nano pilots had, that will not project the same nerfs t o wning a t2 bpo while the vast makority of the inventors out there have to deal with negative me and pe. it's called balancing. can't you wrap your heads around that concept? and, if this truly an argument from 2006, it is still a valid argument today.and as an owner of a t2 bpo as well as an inventor i can say i'd have no problem if what i have suggested was applied to all t2 bpo owners including myself."
"if invention builders were making no money at all then id say they have a case but the fact is this is about ppl wanting or thinking that they can make more if t2 bpo's are removed and that is rubbish.will you whinning cry baby invention muppets be asking ccp to give myself and others the isk we could have made over the years we did not have invention?. you morons have been given a gift that myself and others never had and the first thing you do is cry about the fact that ppl who invested and have been playing the game longer can make more isk than you can.you are pathetic tbh."
"lol!! wow!! stepping on your toes maybe? btw, been playing since 2004. i suspect you of being an alt, if so, please post with your main and discuss rather than yell and holler like a little kid. thanks!"
"my main (mid 2003 player) is banned for posting cat pictures on caod and i do not own any bpo's let alone t2. but if your a 2004 player you should see how lucky you are to have invention instead of complaining that others can make a bit more isk than you can.ps: i do not invent either im a piwate/pvper and make my isk from loot."
"i had to check to see that i have included the fact that i have a t2 bpo myself, and would be affected by the same thing i'm suggesting. envious that others are making more isk than i am? not at all. oh, and to others who have posted in response to this post, i do invent some of the newer t2 ship and module bpc's.i'll not waste everyone's time by repeating what i've already stated.cat posts in coad huh? that's an original reason i give you a +10 on that!"
"so you think that just because you \"claim\" to own a t2 bpo and have made a rather poor attempt to discredit my point by making a alt comment ( did somebody use the word original). the fact remains the anybody now can invent and make money off t2 items while for years that option was unavailable, and the first thing a few cry babies do is complain that others can make more.just because you \"claim\" to have a t2 bpo does not stop you from being greedy or jealous of ppl who have more or others, in fact it shows that you are a heavy builder and as such massively biased.go away."
"converting t2 bpo's to max run t2 bpc's = win."
"alt comment? i am pretty sure i've been posting with my main. please post with valid points versus high school debating tactics."
"t2 bpos are fine as they are now that they are competing with invention. not supported."
"the alt comment you made was against me and my mains ban for posting pictures, or do you have the brains and memory of a goldfish cos i do not claim anywhere that you are posting with a alt. \"ad hominem\" attacks are for ppl who have lost their case tbh. but its not unusual for morons to use the \"you are a alt get out of jail free card\" when they have no argument against a point. personally i think everybody should post with alts at least then ppl would be forced to focus on the content instead of the poster and his/her corp/alliance history like you and others who's argument has fallen apart do."
"i'm ending this, you may keep posting however."
"good go away and post on caod thats where ppl insult instead of debate and complain and cry about things instead of taking advantage of opportunities that arise and that others over the years were not lucky enough to have had.go play wow or summat i am sure you can get a job as a gold farmer on one of the servers."
"ok, one more maybe by your own definition you should go play wow. i thought it was funny that you posted cat pictures on coad and got banned for it. i actually admire that for originality. that wasn't an insult. apparently that's a sore point with you. at any rate, fly safe, i've posted in several more threads if you'd like to go call me names in them too"
"like anybody is supprised. a self claimed 2004 player who thinks that posting cat pictures is original?..yea right pal your lies are getting worse. no need if your ideas are as moronic as they were on here but il check anyway."
"disclaimer: i am an armchair tacticiancurrently, mid-range combat is nearly non-existent in eve. i think that there are a few things we can do to encourage more mid-range combat.currently, these are the reasons (as i see it) why combat occurs at extreme close or extreme long range:1.viable range of high-dps weapons2.range of warp scramblers3.range of stasis webifiers4.prevalence of mwds in pvpthings that we should do, however:a. create new forms of t2 ammunition designed to give high dps at moderate ranges (40-60km). this would be part of a general overhaul to t2 ammunition and should not be unbalanced relative to close-range t2 ammo.b. extend the range of warp scramblers and warp jammers, like so:warp core burst scrambler: 3 jamming strength, 7.5km rangewarp core modulation scrambler: 2 jamming strength, 15 km rangewarp core attenuation scrambler: 1 jamming strength, 30km rangec. discourage mwd use in pvp. currently almost all ships in any pvp situation use mwds due to the lack of importance of signature radius and the prevalence of capacitor boosters in pvp (making maximum capacitor less important). goumindong actually proposed an interesting solution that would address this problem by making stasis webifier effectiveness dependent on signature radius. another possibility could be to change their penalty to something that would be more painful in pvp - perhaps weapon tracking and missile explosion velocity.d. increase the range of stasis webifiers. currently all non-faction stasis webs have a maximum range of approximately 12km, meaning that any ship fitting one must be fit for close-range combat. this ties in with goumindong's suggestion covered in point c, but something else that is also a possibility - create different sized stasis webs:frigate webs: 80-90% effectiveness, 10km base rangecruiser webs: 50-60% effectiveness, 20km base rangebattleship webs: 25-30% effectiveness, 40km base rangei realize that the above changes will affect nano-ships and perhaps hurt their effectiveness a bit, but it will also give them a greater operating range as they will be able to take advantage of these changes as well.yay or nay? am i on to something here or am i just another carebear that thinks he knows what's going on in pvp?"
"if chribba has 10.0 ore standing i would favor just giving him an ore single issue prototype veldnaught. +400% veld yeild. -60% anything else and his faction capital sized mining lasers. that guy is fun.i am still hoping for better yield ore in 0.0. basically veld in empire stays as is and if the region has ark empire gets very crappy ark roids. in exchange though, 0.0 gets supercrystalline veldspar with like 5-6 times the yield in trit. it wouldn't be a straight jump. it would occur in .5 sec bands in that region. .5 above where it normally shows up is gets cut to 60-80%. .5 lower than when it shows up per region it gets 50% boost. numbers are of course made up and not balanced but they could be."
"this game more than many other mmo's has some fantastic opportunities for players who like to trade and get involved in science and industrywould be great to see more industrial expansion. ideally see something more than a whole economy geared towards people blowing stuff up (though where you get the extra consumers from i'm not really sure)"
"have you ever tried to manage corp standing to make sure that only the right people dock in outposts or gets shoot at by your pos, or have you tried to catch a hostile only to see him dock at your outpost becourse corp standing was not set?i propose that corp should inherent alliance standing so that if someone is hostile to alliance he is hostile to corp as well.corp standing should still override alliance standing as it does not but i really don't see any reason to make corps set the same standings as alliance just so their pos's shoot the right people and their outposts lets the right guys dock.should be simple to do and i cannot see any downsides to this, so what do you think?"
"freindly bump. kelsin, i don't care what your motivations are, if any. i just had a question."
"your proposal is ill-concieved and targeted towards appeasing a minority (a minority which star fraction is well known for championing, nonetheless) that would rather mope around forums *****ing about how hard it is to get a foot-hold in nullsec rather than doing what every other successful alliance has done in the past and actually go out and take it.this proposal is as transparent as the rest of star fraction's agenda. funny that, i could have sworn it was going to be the goons that would try to subvert the csm process to their own ends."
"castrated is about right. 100mbit of bandwidth would make me much more likely to fly this ship again."
"even if 100mbits were given there is a need for replacement heavies + a set of lights atleast. also compare it to easily the best bc: the hurricane. it mounts an effective shield buffer while being able to fit 3 damage mods in its lows, its guns require no cap, and it's dps isn't drones meaning that it does not need to take time to travel to a target while also being more useful under sentry fire also giving it the capability to use ecm drones. if the myrmidon fits a dual rep tank, which given it's bonus, it will, it won't really have a damage mod. also, it is very cap dependent relying upon cap boosters, it doesn't receive a gun damage bonus as well as having it's dps as a vulnerability. it's not like the myrmidon can just fit a rack of nosferatu to suck an opponent's cap dry, it can't use neuts effectively because it is heavily cap dependent, it receives no weapons damage bonus while also not having a damage mod in it's lows...that' leaves the midslots and current drone layout to make up for it. it doesn't. an extra mid while nice allows you waht? eccm, fine. web point disrupt mwd eccm. considering the fact that your weapons aren't the main point of damage anyway and drones do auto-aggro i don't think locking will be the biggest issue. an extra web is nice or a sensor booster, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the myrmidon doesn't really have a niche."
"drake is the best of all bc. (sorry i couldn't resist)also i still think changing the turrets to larger drone bandwidth is the way to go. the brutix is already a gunship like the ferox. caldari switch to secondary weapon type and it makes since that gallente should too."
"signed. i'd like to see more in-game mechanics support for roleplay stuff people do. people can erect stupid statues of themselves irl so why not in eve?maybe make them degrade slowly over time so they need a little occasional maintainance (sp?)"
"actually, i agree. this is one of those areas that clearly delineates the difference between you and i. i see wrong as wrong even if i'm the one doing it. it is still wrong. but just because i've never been innocent doesn't mean i can't stand up and say it is wrong either.plainer, i've never had any fear of facing the consequences or repercussions of my choices and actions. that this idea would be trolled is so blindingly obvious that only moronic trolls would find \"win\" in standing up and identifying themselves as trolls. they don't think about what they are doing - they are just programmed that way. but unlike them, i always know what i do and thus i am, at that specific moment, ready to own up no matter what the price.ps: just because you are a liar and a hypocrite does not mean others who honestly hold contrary positions are the same as you. just as a bit of advice."
"let me get this right...you are too stupid to check the bottom of your browser to see where a link goes so you want the ability to type in custom names for your links banned.the following link is not a rickroll:xd"

"level of intelligence attack is ad hominem and pointless. with youtube links it becomes a matter of trying to remember a specific url sequence or (which is why i said blind linking) people have taken to using redirectors.firstly, i work from home. thus what i read is my business. secondly, i know what to look for as i'm far from computer illiterate. however in my experience i've had to determine whether some poor guy was blind linked somewhere while at work because our monitoring software detected such activity. it is very very hard to some times to do so and human resources (even colder hearted people than you) are quick to terminate people regardless of whether or not it was a blind link./me sighs. again you think that because someone champions a cause they must be a victim of it. stop displacing your lack of maturity or ethics on the people that enter your limited awareness. we, the rest of the world, are not like you. thank god for that."

(carrier 5, lol)or you could sum up all the sp and just leave it to the player to feed it to the skills.the disadvantage of the first is that it needs some anti-superlonglvl5skill protection. the pro is that the skilltraining is alredy a part of eve.for the summing up sp... well, i can't see a serious disadvantage besides vets not noticing that they can get their sp reimbursed and will send in a pention.

"there are several current problems with starbase logistics from the perspective of anyone who regularly needs to set up new poss. the two most significant of these are, simply:that the process of anchoring, onlining a control tower and its modules can - and regularly does - take a minimum of five to eight hours to complete. this time commitment can not be reduced.that, with the exception of the first hour, the entire process requires constant user interaction with the game in order to progress. this can not be avoided.it's worth mentioning that there exist a number of laughable design flaws and bugs in the management and anchoring interfaces - but fixing those is a matter for bug reports, not the csm. instead, i want to focus on these two broader gameplay issues with a reference to the way these flaws make them so much more unbearable.---issue 1the problems with setting up new starbases begin when the player starts anchoring pos modules, after the tower itself has been anchored and onlined. each module has its own anchoring and onlining timers before it can become useful: guns and electronic warfare mods take five minutes to anchor and a further five to online, while cynosural system jammers take a half-hour to online. unfortunately, the actual process of setting up these mods is entirely manual, and breaks down like this:the module to be anchored is launched for the player's corporation from their cargohold.the player either right-clicks on the module in space and selects \"anchor\", or opens the pos management interface, selects the desired module and presses the \"anchor\" button\". a green box appears around the module in space, which a set of silver arrows that can be dragged along each axis.the player then moves the green box to the desired location on the grid, then right-clicks any of the arrows to select \"anchor here\".after the anchoring timer, the player either right-clicks the module from within ~5km and select \"put online\", and presses the corresponding button in the management interface.i've italicised the broken parts. since a typical 0.0 deathstar will include anywhere from 20 - 40 modules in need of anchoring, the simple process of setting up a control tower can require six or more hours of constant, tedious player interaction. add to this that the arrows themselves are tiny and difficult to position (only a few hundred metres long), which can make simply positioning each module a tedious and - in the case of players that suffer from rsi, such as myself - physically painful process.---issue 2there exists no way to hasten or streamline to the process of anchoring and onlining pos modules. if you want to set up a full 0.0 deathstar, you must return your attention to the game every five minutes, adding up to six or more hours of unavoidable tedium that actively detracts from gameplay. if we accept that the element of risk introduced by making it take long enough to set up a pos for a hostile force to react, the game desperately needs a way to reduce the level and duraction of player interaction required.i should say that the option exists to pre-position all the mods at a tower so that the player need not deal as much with ccp's ridiculous placement interface - but this requires leaving them unanchored and floating in space, vulnerable to theft and destruction. the risk associated with attempting to step around the inadequacies of eve's interface are totally unreasonable. the game desperately needs, at the very least, a method to pre-position modules so that the player can simply position every module and then find something fun to do for the next eight hours.---the original \"features and ideas\" forum thread i posted on this issue can be found here."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"i was too bored by the process to even read all of the op so god only knows how bored i would be by the process itg (in the game)"
"there can be no better summation."
"it starts to be alot of fun when you are onlining 3 or 4 death stars in the same system, 5 to 8 hrs of warping between pos's anchor, online, anchor online lol, drive you crazy very quickly.i would like to see the ability to online and anchor at the same time, anchor one mod and online another, or maybe stream line it even more, upto 5 mods anchor and online at the same time. i understand why the time sink, its to prevent mega alliances from insta spaming systems, but this happens anyway, and for the people doing it, it drives them nuts, but just because they are going crazy isnt going to stop them from putting the towers up.maybe even a pos layout screen that lets you plan your pos setup, then it takes the 8 hrs but does it on auto, keeping all the mods in the pos shields until each mod is moved one by one to its place, anchored and if the layout says to onlined by the tower itself, not a player sitting there for hrs on end banging his/her head on the desk waiting 5 more min for that next array."

"i would rather see a skills que in place, then to continue getting s.p. during expired times. the fact is that most people saying, this is not a good idea are bringing up valid points. but the problem is the chance for abuse (not saying that all those opposed to it, are abusing it, but i sure some of them are).the problem comes in when people create a second account and train up an alt to sell and make billions of isk by exploiting a privilage given to us by ccp to help with those valid reasons mentioned.so a possible solution is that you can still train but at 1/4 the speed or with something like for every 4 months countinuous subscrption to an account you can get 1 months worth of training on that inactive account but both these ideas would be more dificult than just getting rid of it all together"
"you should go back to your school teachers and complain. you obvious do not understand the difference between speculation and deceit. and i'll admit that what i suggested was an unfounded speculation but one has to wonder if you do not benefit from the system as is why are you for strongly for it? the clearest bit of logic (to what gain?) proves that you may not be quite honest in your intentions. to be fair, you might not have expired accounts (right now) but that you might just be trolling. perhaps you invested in matalino's datacore farming warehouse ipo. the one thing that is missing is a clear idea of why you think it is wrong.so, instead of trying snide personal attacks about what you think i want eve to be why don't you tell me what is wrong with taking a critical look at passive resource gain?i realize that sp gain, passively, is an inherent facet of eve. a pure fundamental that differentiates it from the rest of the mmo market. however ccp already has no sp gain on expired accounts active on eve china. so there is data available about the effects this can have, pro and con, for ccp and the playerbase.as to rp gain; i think passive gain and expired account passive gain should be reviewed with a critical eye. it is, plainly, free isk. one can, and has, argue that it is a return on investment of skill training and standing gains. passive gain should be a clearly unplatable choice in comparison to active gain of research points. the doubling of return is clearly not it since it is far easier, and less effort, to skill up & standings grind alts on a second account. then you simply let the account expire and start again with another account. keep up the rotation and you have alt economy of scale.this is not working smarter or working harder. it's just taking undue advantage of the game by people that don't pay to play. any advantage like that is a clear disadvantage to those who do pay to play.i await your response and hope that you can refrain from the ad hominem or the straw man argument styles."
"and how is that china server doing? oh? 3000 at peak you say. let's use it as an example of why this is a good idea.i think ccp would try this again (they have already tested the waters with the 'accidental' note in the patches that was 'intended for the china server' (even though they have said the entities are completely separate). last time drew massive amounts of ire from the playerbase, but greed is good.personally i don't care, my accounts are active most of the time anyway. however, i cannot support this issue as i do like letting them lapse occasionally."
"half supported. yes on the rp, because that's messing with teh t2 market.no on the sp, because it's just silly to deny such an awesome game feature"
"i really think this thread needs to be split into 2 seperate issues:sp gain while account inactive: no support for stopping skill training while an account is inactive. doing so means that my account will stop training even if i renew 1 minute later. and i think its important for people to be able to do other things without getting significantly behind on their training.and rp gain while account inactive: definatly support, if you can gain rp while your account is lapsed you can leave it lapsed until you want to cash out. you are essentially getting an award for doing absolutely nothing. where skill training will eventually expire, rp gain does not."
"ummm if i go afk for like a week and my gtc runs out i dont want to lose sp. ok. thx."
"if you were smart, you would of spearated the two issues."
"i stated early into the thread that while it maybe different points being added on the issue is essentially the same. accumulation of passive resources upon expired accounts. while my history demonstrates my level of \"smart\" it also shows that i do things honestly. to split the issue, by me, would be dishonest in my book./me shrugsso you're reason for this to continue is it is a safety measure to protect you from your own \"fail\"?i agree, it is an awesome game feature. but like i said, bringing one kind of expired resource gain into review should also bring the other as well.concluding my involvement here: half support is fine too. csm members are not idiots and will see the value of this idea upon it's own merits. they will also see what is \"popular\" of this issue and what is not. so the point of splitting it up is really moot. just speak your pro's and con's and support or not support and everything will be good in the end.

"my suggestion is to modify local chat so that it doesn't show who is in system.local chat is currently used as a tactical tool and i believe this hinders the atmosphere and game play potential of the game.this would make space much more exciting, potentially lead to more dynamic pvp opportunities and would encourage people to work together more and in new ways. it would make space feel like the giant ocean it is, not just a series of interconnected fishbowls.i believe that constellation chat should auto-update, rather than local chat. this way hostiles can still be located but not instantly pinpointed to a single system.i think this would be a balanced change for the better, as though it may benefit a potential attacker, it may also benefit someone who doesn't want to engage ie a miner or someone hauling. it would make fleets more reliant on intelligence from players rather than from a box full of names.discussif you are opposed to this idea, before you post i ask that you take this viewpoint: imagine what i have detailed in the op is being implemented, what checks and balances would you suggest should go hand in hand with this change?would shifting scan able asteroid belts, similar to the instances that can be found using the basic ship scanner satisfy you?

"i support this issue. not because i think he earned it because how it added to formation of the csm, but because i was allways disapointed by ccp's response to that matter and because the formal reasoning of ccp for his ban was something alike \"he put additional workload to our employees, which is an eula violation\".additionally while they accused him of illegal \"hacking\", they never showed any proof/evidence to thoose accusations."

"does that mean you are interested in discussing the matter in the original post?"
"it means exactly what i said. i cannot condone anything illegal for a multitude of reasons.whatever actions were taken, ccp acting on hearsay regarding attacks which were not focused on them is something i find disturbing should it prove to be true. i represent people who have been on the receiving end of claims of \"denial of service\" attacks which was farcical at best and i can tell you i don't like the insinuation. i don't find it hard to believe others may have been falsely labeled without merit."
"the results of his findings did not show that \"illegal hacking\" was involved in aquiring the information. he was banned for \"putting workload\" to ccp employes. a very vague formulation from ccp, which also doesnt explain how a player can protect himself from accidently putting workload to a ccp employee either :pin the end, every eve player profits from **********s findings and the introduction of the \"internal affairs\" \"department\" at ccp."

"in the very least as a way of forcing ccp to be honest with itself. blaming the person that exposed one's flaws is not a healthy step to take in the process of removing those flaws, and bringing it up in the very committee that was formed because of it would be rather fitting. it's pretty easy to demonize ********** but it's not ccp's position to police what rules or standards someone allegedly violates outside the game, just the rules in the eula. to put it in simpler much more drastic terms- nobody in the history of the game other the kugu has been banned for allegedly breaking a law in real life, and the punishment was handed out for the crime without an investigation that a real lawbreaker would get.not liking someone is not a legitimate reason to ban"
"fully support bring kugu back."
"unbanning might undo some of the pr damage this has caused ccp. if ccp does this right they can put a huge positive spin on this unbanning."
"you shouldn't get banned for exposing unjust dev behavior, i'll say unban the fella."
"supporting this."
"supporting this."
"signed"
"after reading the story on eve tribune i support this. the council should definitely try to get some response from ccp on this. from what i read ccp handled this whole matter poorly."
"free kugutusmen"
"always thought getting banned for what he did was out of order."
"he is banned because he was upsetting people at ccp, not for any game reason. don't for one second think it was because he acted illegally in any way towards ccp.as a direct result of his discoveries, possible lines of corruption were removed. additional communications between ccp and the playerbase were implemented. i think as a community we should be thanking him, even if you disagree with his methods."
"all the dude wanted was his rug back."
"being banned for exposing those who cheatrd was out of order in the first place"
"he did the community a favor and was banned because it was \"inconvient\" to the devs."
"agreed, however would like a clarification as to it being a special case or not - else i think there will be an influx of these cases."
"dude did a good thing for this community."
"supporting this"
"free kugutusmen!"
"kugutusmen is a fighter for da ppl and ppl want him free!"
"supporting this"
"i'm ofcourse biased due to my corp but i've also heard both sides of the story which put the press releases by ccp and the bob caod-propaganda back then in a whole different light.the banning of ********** has been a blemish on ccp's reputation. one which almost made me quit this game. the way they have handled the whole issue has been utterly unprofessional and by unbanning ********** they can make a gesture to the playerbase that their stance on the matter was sub-optimal in the past and that they have now changed their ways.thanks for starting this initiative, torshin."
"darius,while i can't currently find the post, ccp xhagen said in a post early on in the csm discussion that if the csm asked, he would get ia to show up... good luck"
"supported.unban him immediately, and end this grievous miscarriage of justice. especially given the cheaters, and those that profitted from their actions weren't punished in the least. it's ridiculous that a whistleblower took the only fall."
"okay, my ignorance is apparently just the guy's name, because i certainly know of the incident in question. yeah, this ban is bs, and he ought to get his account back."
"personally i don't know enough details on if his ban was just or not. all i can find on the internet (including wikipedia) is that he was banned for creating workload. i support that he ether get unbanned or a just reason be provided as this is a blemish on a company who has created an amasing game."
"supporting this"
"supporting this, what ever happened to that ccp employee? prob works in the petition dept.just quoting that cause bb is ****ing awesome**edited to include the stupid thumbs up thing"
"never. ccp handed him a ban. the ban stays. they are under no obligation to allow anyone to play thier game if they so chose and frankly peeing in the sandbox just makes it moist for everyone."
"i support this product and/or service."
"agreed, its about time ccp corrects their knee-jerk reaction and banning."
"voting before the thread disappears"
"notification warp drive operation 1 is complete"
"a 1-depth skill queue or dual training would go a long ways to reduce the annoyance of a skill having only 30 min left, but you can't stick around to switch the skill when it completes. so i greatly support the idea."
"/support"
"supported."
"how about you just start another skill then? problem resolved. anyone has anything to add?"
"do want."
"considering yesterday's past events, i now support this."
"supporting this."
"this seems necessary, now."
"fiasco. it's quite sad that he couldn't even hide his bias while acting as a chairman. i understand during the discussions. but it's totally not cool to be so biased while acting as chairman."
"after his actions in the most recent meeting, i'm signing this."
"jade's off the reservation and needs to be reigned in."
"i abstain. that counts as a vote of support."
"i don't think i even need to say anything after the unprofessional bs that jade showed in the last meeting. something needs to change.(wow, this thread has more supports than jade's \"big thread\" about blowing up stations, hmm...)"
"i'm fairly suprised that one even hit the meeting. while i would like to discuss the options or things which could have the same effect, i think that the amount of support shown is waaay too low to even justify it reaching the agenda.while i did vote aye, since it reached the agenda, i still think it was incorrect for it to even reach the agenda. some issues were much more important and would be of much more interest to the average player."
"i was surprised, myself. perhaps there needs to be clarification on the minimum required support for an issue to make it to a formal vote?"
"it's pretty clear as-is - unless one of these threads hits ~11000 thumbs, it's a straw poll, and no more. it's csm member support that dictates agenda appearances, not public support. now, they'd have to be idiots to ignore public support generally, but i'll even accept it in the case of platform commitments, which is what that issue was. i can't tell you offhand what the other 8 successful platforms were, but if other reps want to ram through their main election issues onto the agenda, even with low levels of support, i see nothing wrong with that. frankly, they'd be disenfranchising their voters if they didn't."
"as much as i think darius was also out of line, jade is just plain crazy.kick them both and restore balance and peace to the council!"
"jade is a useless moron with delusions of grandeur get him off my council"
"i have nothing but the utmost faith in jade constantine"
"welp, he was just as delusional as i feared he would be."
"he's off his rocker"
"jade you are a total rear end in a top hat. i support your removal."
"i agree with a gs member, uh oh"
"thumbs up for hamlet"
"i don't know how this is supposed to be surprising but vov"
"ugh, the goons are ruining this game with their skilless blob warfare and constant undermining of the csm.i mean come on guys, ccp try to do something new and unique and the red goon federation has to go **** all over them for it???"
"yeah"
"why is it 99% goonswarm members doing thumbs up in this thread and barely no others?"
"because while most alliances have a small segment that browse forums avidely, goons coming from somethingawful.com forums all tend to do this. so there's more of us than your average alliance :)"
"maybe the other people posting in the thread are incapable of reading a chatlog."
"because goons don't like having anyone other than one of their own as chair of the csm and resent any attempt for the chair to act like one. i.e. moderate the freakin meeting."
"i want jade constantine as well as everyone else on this council to quit the political games and get to work. last night was an embarrassment and a slap in the face to all the people that voted. take a look at your fancy elected governments all over the world, as soon as politics get involved, their productivity drops to near zero as they are bickering over non-issues. cut out the politics, your egos and your personal pet agendas, and start serving the people. honor your duties as a council member and work towards making this game better - for everyone.despite the unprofessionalism in yesterdays meeting, i'm not going to support this thread as it's yet another non-productive political game. while jade constantine is the one responsible on paper, it is not constructive to start attributing everything that went wrong to a single person, be it jade or anyone else.i ask of everyone to refrain from pointing fingers and look at themselves for a moment. think how you can prevent this from happening next time. i have taken part in numerous discussions and i have seen debates that were chaired by people that performed much worse than jade did in the last meeting turn out extremely productive. again, you can't attribute yesterday's fiasco to a single person.let's all think about what happened, learn from it and make sure we'll all do a better job next time!"
"yeah. everybody knows that goonswarm has a higher percentage of people that can read.i've been around long enough to know that goonswarm isn't biased in any way. why...they're the cream of the crop....real peachy keen individuals.......always fair....that's goonswarm.oh look. i think that pig just made orbit under its own power.windjammer"
"thanks, ank. at least this is one thing i can agree with on this thread.best regards,windjammer"
"but alliance pilots are only 10% of the eve population ?"
"get back in your corner and sharpen a pencil or something(j/k)"
"thanks for the personal attack instead of a defence of jade's actions. when even his own alliance's alts won't defend him you know he's sunk."
"i was prepared to see how things pan out.but after reading the latest csm log, i have to say that i have no confidence in jade's abilities as chairman."
"i am going to agree with ankh here.while i do believe that the meeting was poorly managed by jade yesterday, particularly the blatant and biaised editorialising, this is still a 'learning' process. we are in effect creating the model by which future csms will operate and that is by its very nature an 'interesting' and painful process. i do hope that jade, indeed all of us, can learn from this and move forward more constructively.we should not get distracted by the bickering towards the end of the meeting when a lot of good work was also passed. if even 50% of the issues we have passed on to iceland get seriously looked at by ccp and resolved then i think csm will have done an amazing job (bickering aside)..."
"let me see, i will go ahead and assume that you are intending that this message was pointed at me as well. first point, honoring your duties. it's my duty to represent the people who voted me. i will assume that it's in everbody's interest that people act maturely, so that we work effectively. i *several* times told people to move on and i tried to addres the chairman, in order for that to happen.what did it help? nothing. i was ignored until i called out jade personally.unless jade does take this critism to him, i can't really help preventing this. i tried several times to make things go smoother. but i wil make the same point as above, i was blalantly ignored.i really hope that things will be better next time. but i will judge at that time."
"he deserved a chance but showed he is not capable of beeing the chairman."
"yea,and it feels a bit like ccp have put you all in a empty room and given you some ikea furniture to decorate whit but not given you any assembly plans, so its gonna take some time for you guys to put it all toghter.but i think you will fix it,if not, get hammer and nails and some super glue."
"(repost from jita park) as to the general complaints about muting raised here. i stand 100% behind what i did. and i'd do exactly the same next time, to any csm member who ignores 2 formal warnings on disruptive behaviour. i'm expecting certain rules of courtesy from csm members in council and these need to be respected if this process is going to go anywhere.its been established that raising a hand \"!\" in channel is to be used to indicate a desire to speak. from there the chair recognizes individuals by name and they speak in order as called. once we've moved to a vote on an issue it is not appropriate to continue debating against the notion of the vote - clarification can be asked for, its considered respectful behaviour to listen to clarification while its being given.now text based meetings of this sort are extremely challenging - there is no verbal queue, no eye contact, and very little peer pressure on members of the council to behave properly. yesterday's session is an example of what happens when moderation from the chair is not followed. we managed to get through the agenda by pure force of will and stubborn resolve on the part of the csm officers however - if we'd ended on time - items 6 to 17 on the agenda would not have been heard.but it does show there are problems. i'm pretty unhappy with the in-game chat system and its functionality in this medium. the mute function does not work as it should do, the word limits mean that statements are broken up and its too easy for people to interrupt and break the flow of meaning. i'd personally be much happier with a voice meeting or even using irc chat where the moderation functions work correctly.end of the day though, that agenda was discussed and resolved and what needed clarifying got clarified. i repeat, i'm a 100% behind the moderation decisions taken and will do exactly the same thing next time if people refuse to respect the process of the meeting and keep cross-talking and interrupting and behaving disruptively."
"so how will you be voting on this issue when it comes up in the next meeting jade?if it doesn't come up at the next meeting i'd imagine that your position will only become more untenable"
"the institution of a vote of no confidence in the position of chairperson is integral to the ability of this body to function democratically.this issue needs to be on the agenda, as well as formalizing the powers of the chairperson to control the meeting. even deferrence to an existing set of procedures (such as the procedures of the british parliament) would be desireable."
"well if lavista or bane wish to allege that that i've violated csm processes or suffer from obvious mental illnesses then i'm going to vote against obviously. (unless of cause they can show precisely how i've violated those processes or maybe produce a certificate of mental illness). i guess either possibility is as likely."
"i have no intention of raising this issue. i'm sure things will work out next time."
"actually this issue would determine if a vote of no confidence in the csm chair is allowed at all. interesting that you would assume that two of your csm members want you removed as chair though."
"that's a sudden change in position from earlier. has something changed to make you change your mind?"
"no. i just have high hopes that jade will take this seriously and not make the same mistakes next time."
"the motion doesn't call for a vote of no confidence in you. it calls for the institution of a procedure whereby a vote of no confidence in the chairperson can be called and passed, and what occurs once this has happened.your behaviour has merely highlighted the necessity of such a formal procedure. whether it is ever called to depose you is up to your fellow councillors."
"considering jade has stated that he feels he did nothing wrong and would act the same next time i feel you are sadly mistaken."
"but i'm not going to judge if an elected person isn't good enough for a job, from 1 failed meeting.i'm sure while jade states he would do the same, that probably isn't the whole truth. he will think and learn from history, like everybody else."
"the lesson learned from that last meeting is for the chair to be firmer, sooner, and take a much more vigorous hand in preventing unrecognized interruptions from the representatives lavista. if people will not follow the discipline of raising their hand to be recognized to speak then it is impossible to keep order between nine people in an text chat. if this happens again i'll be inclined to act earlier and more decisively to warn the people doing this and ensure we don't waste time with pointless cross talk and off-topic interruptions while we are trying to go through the agenda."
"keep digging."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"talking about a 180 degree turn vista..."
"no. i showed my support for discussing what options we have for removing a chairman, should it be needed. i have already discussed this idea several times, even before i was elected. i didn't show support for removing jade. i'm still not happy about what happened, and i don't agree with the way he conducted himself. but i still think he should have a second chance."
"good people protecting bad people is the greater evil."
"i'm not protecting him. i just don't think it's right to even think about removing anybody at this point.i'm sorry if you don't agree. but lets not cause too much drama, if jade does conduct himself differently at the next meeting."
"if you think being even more authoritarian than you were in the last meeting is really going to help then the meeting was a fiasco precisely because you pulled your dictatorial routine - as the chat logs clearly demonstrate. the meeting did go on a long time - but tbh the majority of this was your fault for reopening debate on two issues which had already been discussed. as i said in my mail to csm members your points should either have been addressed at the time the topic was debated or held over and put on the agenda of the next meeting. to imply that the meeting dragged on purely because of the disruption of other csm members is ridiculous.the more you tighten your grip on a fistful of sand - the more of that sand slips through your fingers. use commonsense and accept (occasionally) when you are wrong and things will go a whole lot easier for us all.tbh if someone is being disruptive it should be up to the csm body as a whole to highlight that and then the chair can take appropriate action. as it was i don't feel that inanna was being particularly disruptive and from my perspective you muted her more because she dared to call you out on your 'editorialising' than for any real practical reason.you may disagree with my thinking but people can read the chat log and make up their own minds!"
"hardin, if you want to help curb this excessive abuse of the \"powers\" of the chair - invented or not - please support my motion to include formalizing said powers and introducing the ability for the council to call a vote of no confidence in the chairperson."
"just when you thought it couldnt get any worse...we have last night. a true eve classic in every way. can you imagine when the ceo got the chat log emailed to him last night. sitting there with his morning coffee-about 30 lines in you get one giant \"wtf\" followed by screaming, banging, and throwing stuff at the intern seated just outside.yes jade wield your almighty power even more-let's see how that works out. next step wholesale resignations from the csm board followed by jade sitting alone in a conference room in iceland-occasionally muting himself while he endlessly scrawls \"i won the most votes\" on a white board."
"you might want to read jades responses in the thread on the meeting"
"jade, you should not hand out 'warnings' to people who's message appears within a few seconds of you halting the debate. its completely uncalled for in a chatroom setting due to the fact that person was probably typing their message before you signaled the debate to be halted. also if someone wants to finish something or have some sort of input on the subject you should give them the floor - not mute them because you want to rush to the vote. also don't plan on so many agenda items, knock out the ones with little support to leave room for discussion, so the meeting won't take 4 hours to complete. also, politics is fully a part of the csm. the csm is a political system you will have to make due with this fact."
"you will do no such thing and i will not ask for your permission to speak. that's just ****ing ridiculous. i support this motion. somewhere this went from a council to discuss eve to the jade constantine look at me hour. (or 4)"
"if jade knocked out the issues that had little support its exploding outpost item wouldn't have made the agenda silly."
"after reading the chat log in all it's bureaucratic power trip glory, there should certainly be some from of mechanism for the csm to change chairpeople if they lack confidence in the existing one. frankly i'm surprised there wasn't one already, it is a staple mechanism of your basic comittee.whether jade should or should not be removed is an irrelevant side issue - thats not the proposal. the proposal is to get some form of mechanism for no confidence votes onto the table in the first place, regardless of who the chairman is."
"can i ask what is the difference between asking permission to speak and abiding by a system where people speak in turn?"
"in one you ask permission from someone... in the other you wait respectfully for your turn. now that that's out of the way i was responding to jade's statement that people should wait for jade's permission to speak. clear enough for you?"
"you are digging your self a big hole. for the players best interest, and your own, please step down.no confidence in the chair."
"it's a matter of interpretation to some extent - if people are raising their hands (the \"!\" in chat, right?) and then speaking in order and the chair is the one recognizing each person in turn - then that is a little of both.there was a lot of people speaking without respectfully waiting their turn and that's part of the problem."
"no, let them serve their term and vote differently next time."
"they are there to fulfill their role. if they can't do it competently they shouldn't be there and let others step in."
"the first time the \"!\" was seen was at yesterday's meeting. serenity took it upon him self to start doing it. i am not going to pretend i give a hoot about anything beyond jade's abuse of authority it doesn't have. i don't. that is what was wrong with yesterday's meeting. if we could all conduct ourselves without this looming air of threats and desire for e-power then i doubt needing to prostate one's self to someone who isn't in any position of any authority would be an issue."
"but you're an important internet space c e o how dare they(p.s. \"prostrate\")"
"how dare you correct me dog. *sets read only on all forums*"
"you're supposed to say you were right when you said prostate and anyone who says otherwise is either a) part of a goon conspiracy or b) wants csm to fail."
"i had actually typed that out and got distracted. thanks for stealing my thunder."
"i support the vote of no confidence."
"csm e-pen power has made jade harebrained. i'd expect more from a 38 old chap.wait, it's jade. i wouldn't!"
"all part of the goon conspiracy to make you fail at the csm.am i doing this right?"
"once persons are voted in their positions they should be given peace to do what they were selected to do for the period. especially in online environment possibility of bringing up votes for light reasons is bad. it will eventually lead in to situtation where no one can do anything because their actions are instantly reversed by a vote next day. or even more likely they're voted to be banned etc. instead of crying out loud for \"democratic\" mob justice how about thinking new methods so issues can be handled through more fairly and in orderly matter with less personal conflicts."
"i support this! some people don't seem to understand what they're voting on here. we're not voting on a call of no confidence in jade . . . we're voting for the ability to call for a vote of no confidence for the chair of the csm."
"good idea to the op."
"i believe this is necessary."
"i move for a vote of no confidence in darius johnson. he was supposed to be my black brother. but he lied about his skin colour."
"everyone deserves a second chance."
"i'm going to quote this so hard when someone tries to institute a vote of no confidence in the goonfleet csm members based solely on their corporation.what's that? you mean they did that already?"
"please note who voted against ... (and why)"
"this idea is garbage. it doesn't take a strategic mastermind to know this would simply encourage the superpowers to maintain large dead zones around their space."
"i love how the thread to remove you as csm chair is half as long with almost double the support."
"do not support."
"nay"
"the random people of the assembly hall,recognising the chairperson's responsibilities are crucial to the effectiveness of the csm,noting further these responsibilities include unbiased judgment, maturity, and professionalism,deeply disturbed by the actions of the current chair, jade constantine, in csm meeting three and during the time since, including editorializing at the time of the meeting, and muting an elected csm representative who spoke out against said editorializing, further deploring jade constantine's failure to take responsibility for said failures as chairperson, as well as his threatening of further immature and reprehensible actions,desiring a successful and effective csm,1. calls upon the csm to undertake an immediate vote for the removal of jade constantine from chair;2. further invites the csm to duly elect a new chairperson;3. regrets the necessity of these actions;4. further reminds the csm representatives that they are responsible to the entirety of the eve playerbase to make the csm a success;5. expresses its hope that the csm will be more successful in the future.yeah. i have too much free time. aside from the manner in which it is written i think it speaks for itself. the thread for csm meeting 3, with relevant jadeisms, can be found here -"
"here's how you do it. 1. get your csm reps to pass the csm electable chair issue to the constitution in iceland. 2. hold the election for chair and hope the csm reps choose another chair. 3. result."
"there is nothing indicating in the csm constitution that if this resolution were to pass it would be invalid. furthermore, there is nothing indicating in the csm constitution that an amendment would be necessary to replace the chairperson.\o/ legalese."
"i support this wholeheartedly"
"no ****can we just wait a couple meetings before we act like world is going to end?"
"nah, removing jade is as counterproductive as allowing the council to simply re-elect chair and members. whatever happens ccp will claim it was a success as part of their ham-handed philosophy of player content as king."
"i don't expect the csm would vote jade out because it would add a whole new layer of stressfulness to their positions if that kind of thing happenned."
"i have not read that thread but i have read the chat logs for the 3rd meeting. and as i progressed i went from blinking to, \"this is ****\" to literally being left speechless and with a gaping mouth. how can this person be chairman?also his behaviour towards inanna zuni (which i do not know or have had no contact) is a total shame. along with serenity steele trailing along.appalling. and even more so when you realize this is real world behaviour and that has real life names attached to it."
"the fact a goon wasn't muted or warned first is going to really open some eyes i think."
"i'll add to that by noting that there is no csm constitution. it's a word that was tossed out and made up at the last meeting. there is also nothing preventing a chairman from stepping down. as a matter of fact it may actually be explicitly written into the founding document with a vote for the new chairman as an obvious fallback. i do not have the document in front of me so the above may be partially inaccurate, but i find it a tad disingenuous that one would refer to the documentation in this instance when we can \"fill in the blanks\" when it comes to assigning one's self undefined powers.in other words this is all possible today without a doubt. as a matter of fact that was also mentioned during yesterday's meeting."
"no. vote differently next time."
"why would you have to re-elect anyone? just give the person with the second-most votes (hardin) the chair and give the first alternate a seat on the council."
"the re-elect idea was a jade proposal that seems to be all the rage. v0v"
"frankly, all 'please remove the chair we don't like them' petitions should be tossed out on principle. as long as there is a mechanism for the csm itself to choose elect the chair of their choosing, it's silly to have endless petitions from aggrieved players to remove whoever happens to be chair at the moment."
"there isn't one."
"after reading the chatlog, i support this. 'warning' and then muting people for no reason is not right unless there is a valid reason.i maybe just be paranoid, but anyone notice this was between two of the rpers on the csm?keep your rp sentiments out of the csm."
"one person has commented to me that they wondered whether that was because i have made it very clear i am not on the csm as a representative of my corp / alliance and so wouldn't wardec jade's lot.\"you might say that, i couldn't possibly comment\" is all i can say.iz"
"whist i personally think jade was incorrect for a number of reason to mute you i would like to take this particular opportunity to ask you to leave that area well alone. if the goons or any other alliance/corp represented on the csm decided to war dec star fraction for a slight on the csm i would expect most of the allaince would do two things. first laugh at people not being able to keep out of game activites out of game and secondly cheers for a free war. and whilst you may wish to quote a certain 80's tv show in regards to your opinion on this subject it is quite clear what you are implying by bringing it up. furtheremore i personally feel that the ones at fault is mostly ccp for not providing the csm will more structure before deploying it as i think most of the arguements, diagrements and time wasting of the last couple of weeks can clearly be placed at thier door for the lack of support in creating this council in regards to the procedural side of the csm. if there had have been more of it in place the csm could have got on with representing the people who voted for them straight out the gate rather than it having to spend all this time bickering about simple matter of internal policy."
"they are not at fault, they are to be _thanked_ for not providing said structure. we're here for the entertainment, not to watch boring meetings about pg boosting the nyx.oh, and a thumbs up for removing jade from the chair contrary to my vote at the election. for the entertainment value. ^_^"
"establish a rule of law and a code of behavior before removing anybody.not supported."
"remove him and maybe we could start to see csm with better eyes."
"i second this"
"yeah you are having a laugh to be honest. to say we'd welcome a wardec from the silly goons would be understating the case. there is no force in this game scares us in empire wars inanna. so cut the silly insinuations - it makes you look foolish."
"jade brings up a valuable point. in empire wars the enemies can just sit in the stations and there's really nothing you can do about it (in 0.0 you can blow up the pos and just take the station). i think we need to rectify this by making all outposts destructible."
"before jade thought he would win he said whatever chairman got elected should step down and put it to a vote. after he won he said it was not within the chairman's scope to determine whether or not he could resign (wtf?????) and that ccp would have to rule on it.in conclusion, i support this measure"
"lol you wish."
"as compared to stealth bomber fleets attacking dreadnoughts?"
"that makes us look discojealous!"
"jade is completely out of control."
"i hoped he would calm down or assume a more mature posture.i was wrong. jade really is feeling like he is some sort of god."
"hey weren't you the goon alt who said she'd rather vote for sirmolle than me in the election! smooth."
"jade has gone mad with a moderate amount of power. it's actions to this point are inexcusable."
"honestly, is this some kind of goon campaign to get a goon as chairman?no doubt jade made errors, and would be nice when he would admit he did. but people act like the world is going to end. this happened all after 3:30 hours behind eve to chat with a group others. with eve chat so you have to split what you want to say in several posts, and meanwhile others do the same so everything is one large pile of garbage. not to mention people keep writing stuff when they should sh ut up. and then additionally after 3:30 hours and you want to finish it people also have the urgent need to try to make funny remarks which arent funny. i dont agree with what jade did, but i can understand why he did it.thread goes to goon level orange, next level is red. when red is reached, ccp will initiate total forum lock down and say it has to do with expansion deployment"
"hey aren't you the old man who roleplays a female sex-slave, is trolling a tread just because some people disagree with your childish posture, behaves like a dictator and wants to change the game to suit your own way because after a long hiatus you found out you can't even assault any space anymore with your stealth bombers, and is bitter/passive agressive enough to remember the name of every one who criticizes you!hairy."
"yes i'm rather afraid it is. get used to goon threadnaughts until they get their way."
"remove ankakarebearfail from chair!!! \0/"
"sir molle is the only true internet god king of eve. i will not allow jade constantine to usurp his title!"
"because i'm obviously a goon, right? let me add \"jade is a delusional moron\" to the op, hang on.omg...i finally got it, that other thread that refers to removing a chair based on metal illness..."
"[protip!]i actually clicked on your little avatar and saw that amongst your handful of previous posts there were ones flaming me. nifty eh!"
"why don't you mute me about it?"
"welcome to the real world, you are not everyone. look arround, 90% here is goon or alt (which is probably goon alt, but hard to determine). now goons may have tendency to post quite much, but not this much in the average topic."
"either that, or i dunno, here's a mr slippy's wild ride of adventures grade idea i'm just throwing out here ... maybe you could post with your main?(if you haven't done so earlier in the thread already that is)oops my bad given away another goon protip for influencing the support totals there boys and girls."
"i support this. i am not pleased with the chairman, and this whole situation is extremely awkward if nothing happens, i hope the community will choose someone better next time."
"welcome to the real world, you are not everyone. look arround, 90% here is goon or alt (which is probably goon alt, but hard to determine). now goons may have tendency to post quite much, but not this much in the average topic.goons have no restrictions on their posting. there's no need to use an alt. v0vit's certainly easier though to demonize everyone else and insinuate there's some form of organized campaign. it's way easier than accepting responsibility for example."
"which is the primary reason for this proposal. its hard to have faith that someone will stop making mistakes when that person pretends no mistakes were made and its all some sort of tinfoil-hat conspiracy.furthermore, the trolling jade is currently doing throughout assembly hall threads is endemic of his overall lack of professionalism."
"goons take the blame for everything regardless of if they have anything to do with it.ccp really screwed up without setting some ground rules for this sandbox before they handed it off to the csm children to play in. now it's take whatever power you can and blame goons for anything you don't agree with. because goons are bad right? right?too bad hardin didn't get the most votes at least i have some confidence in him to be a bit more mature. oh and i support this motion."
"that's absolutely no problem whatsoever:"
"indeed.no because holy crap have you seen our forums and the moderating that goes on there? a cork hat would do a better job than jade and a slightly better job than a goon."
"i'd quit eve before i joined the goons, and i'd probably wind up disliking darius as chair almost as much as i do you. bane seems like he could be okay, but i'm hardly confident of that. but given the number of non-goons in on this \"jade's a tyrant\" bandwagon, you'd think you could at least attribute it to something other than a mysterious \"conspiracy\". and besides - even if a goon did get the chair, what would happen then? they're bloody anarchists! it's not like the role gives them power, because whatever power it does have they'd refuse to use."
"you are a fickle man herschel yamamoto. lets see what the future brings."
"actually what he is expressing is a neutral objective view."
"not especially. i voted for you because i liked your vision for the game. i still do - i think there's a few flaws in the implementation, but most of what you outlined i still want to see. my objections are to your actions as chair, not to your actions as a member. i haven't said anything at all against your being on the council, or you bringing forward your platform commitments to the council. i just find your actions as chair appalling. i want you out of the chair and still on the council - i don't think i've said anything that would go against that at any point. i know i stood against the no confidence topic when it was new, but that's because it looked like an attempt to kick you out for reasons of personal dislike. abuse of power is a whole different ball game."
"nope. i don't this all the choises he has made are perfect but considering what he has been up against (and i'm not talking about the goons or anything like that rather the lack of support from ccp) i think he has done a resonable job of it. biased? yes of course.overly so? no not really. i'll happy tell him he sucks if he does ;)"
"i didn't pay attention to the csm or any political aspect of the game (0.0 wars and huge alliance) but i'm pretty sure the chairman shouldn't be posting here.i thought the csm was supposed to add a political aspect to the game and now that something goes wrong, instead of thinking this through, everyone just start ranting over it?i don't think the chairman is the only thing out of control right now.this whole thing is gotta be a joke."
"wait, you think its o.k. when the csm chair applies bais and moderating the discussion because ccp hasn't provided the best tools they could have?how in the world can you make the logical connection between those."
"well you and i disagree on the issue of the muting obviously. i say fickle because it was one decision out of a fractious 4 hour meeting which otherwise place a lot of good issues onto the agenda for the forthcoming meetings with ccp. now perhaps you are right, perhaps i'm wrong. but end of the day you get the whole package when you vote for someone - i'm passionate and mission-orientated when i get involved in something like this. i intended from day one to make a go of this process hence the major effort i've put into issue research/agenda building/feedback and driving the skeletal structure of the csm towards something like a working model. yes yesterday was messy as all hell and lots of disagreements came from my decision to mute inanna. but you know what? i'm proud of the fact we slaved away on a hot evening for 4 hours to get 15 player issues onto the agenda for iceland despite everything. i'd rather have imperfect accomplishments than perfect nothing. over these past three weeks we've built up this process from virtually nothing and are going to achieve everything expected of us in the csm docs. as others have pointed out we aren't making money out of this - everyone is taking time from work, we're paying for our own beer and going to iceland for a lot of meetings and chit-chat and pr stuff for the general good of this game. so if you want to sit back and say \"hey jade as a chairman you're rubbish\" over a 30sec mute intention to get a vote done at the end of a 4 hour meeting and say my judgment is critically flawed as a result then hey, be my guest. but taken in the context of the huge amount of effort i (and other csm reps) have put into making this process actually work rather than simply throwing our hands up in the air and blaming it all on ccp and non-delivery of resources and promises then you are going to need to take a little criticism in return. yes, fickle is not unreasonable."
"that about sums it up. it's a bit late for appeasement, don't you think jade? you put too much effort into denial to stop now. distraction won't work any better."
"i think it is fine for the csm chairman to moderate a discussion as that would be part of the job of the csm chairman as described in the csm document. in regards to bias no i don't think the csm chairman should be biased in stating what others have said and i have said as much however the csm chairman is also a member of the csm elected to give his/her viewpoint and as such will obviously have a personal bias in one direction on every topic no matter who they are. in general i feel jade has kept his neutrality in most situations, with a few excpetions, and as such has done a perfectly resonable job. perfect? no of course not but all things considered perfectly resonable. as for ccp not providing the best tools they could of i think you may wish to think about that a bit harder as ccp have provided next to no tools. in fact it would be more accurate to say they have provided a stick, a drawning pin and a drinking straw and told the members to build a car. the lack of fundamental procedural guidence from ccp has led to all of this as is perfectly apparent when you consider what the difference would have been had they provided instructions to the csm in regards to the chairman's powers to maintain order, how to use them and how they should not be used (one example out of a many). however i assume you feel differently from your many many many many posts on the issue. *shrug* flame away my dear chap."

"i only fly amarr, and our t2 crystals aren't horrible. my only request is to let the crystals stack after use. i know they're 'used' but if they could just be stacked that would be awesome."
"not only gun ammo needs changed, but missiles as well. as the owner of a t2 fury missile bpo, i've been without much of a market since faction missiles came out./signed"
"quake, javelin, gleam and many t2 missiles need much love. all other t2 ammos could be looked at, too."
"why dont we add or replace t2 ammo with side effects like, decreasing speed, scrambling and similar, that would change whole game mechanics ;) and put some fresh air. imagine missle that prevents your target to warp for 1 second, or missle that distrupt lock. dont we have bombs like this with area effect ?anyway something should be done, aside some particular cases t2 ammo is useless."
"the short range ammo is almost universally obsolete in front of the availability of faction ammunition. t2 ammo definitely needs a look at... and the cost of amarr t2 ammunition too, from personal experience, sometimes i spend as much on fitting the ammo as i do on the guns themselves.and you can't split one faction crystal worth 4000 shots between 4 guns. you need four... at least let us be able to repair the special ammunition somewhat. [like repair 20%, reduce max lifespan of the charge by 20%]"
"t2 ammo definetely needs a look, as it stands the penalties are too prohibitive to see much use."
"yeah, t2 ammo should do something faction ammo doesn't already do. i don't care if it's webber missiles, long-range ammo(which is just fine as-is), high-tracking ammo, low-sig ammo, high-damage ammo with fewer stupid penalties(like, make them equivalent on cap to the highest-damage t1 ammo), or whatever, it shouldn't just be picking a few higher spots on the range vs damage curve, and punishing you greatly for using them."
"agreed, something needs doing about this."
"keep long range t2 ammo (buff null and tremor a little bit with extra falloff)change all short range to -10% damage bonus (less than t1, more than 30% less than faction ammo) plus extra effects on your target:void: - cap (e.g. 3 units for large)javelin: - ecm burst effect (e.g. 1 strength lock-break, no 20s jam)conflag: - + heat or heat damage (first does nothing unless the enemy overloads, second would be quite strong over time) to random enemy slots.gleam: - optimal and falloff, 10s.hail: - speed 5s (e.g. -3%)quake: - scan res 10s (e.g. -15% e)rage: + sig radius 20s (e.g. +20)fury: - agility 10s (e.e.g -10%)balance penlaties (need to be similar to today but more lenient in certain cases). where penalties conflict with the effect on an opponent, that should be removed (e.g. stupid to have sig radius bonus on a torp that has a big sig radius, why not use a normal torp).essentially eaech 2o effect is designed to give some advantage that the ships that usually use that weapon would like - blasteboats being able to have their target having cap trouble as well as them, ac boats, if they choose to close range, hurting their opponents speed."
"nighthawk is still horribly gimped if nighthawk pilots have to use powergrid implants while other command ship pilots get to use damage/speed/whatever implants instead. fail troll is fail."
"looking at your fits i can do naught but lawl. n-types, rows and rows of fitting mods, webs but no points, random or no meaningful amount of hardening. i don't know what game you're playing but here in eve the name of the game is opportunity cost and maximizing your strengths. you want the biggest guns and launchers and think the comparison between heaviest caliber missiles and heaviest caliber guns is a fair or accurate one. the problem has nothing to do with the nighthawk and everything do with how close range missile fits require more than standard heavies while the opposite is true of guns--since your fits are neither valid pve or pvp i don't know why you are so insistent on making false analogies. if you're planning on using gang mods you should be using the fleet command not gimping a combat fit--therein lies your problem writ large, you want everything. use faction gear, pg & cpu implants or a different ship but don't confuse the issue. you're not a victim of ccp, get over yourself."
"given that you don't even post with your main his point is valid, you either don't understand how to pvp or all your fits are comedy fits--kb link please."
"i'll explain all this slowly, as you apparently can't read very well (since all this has already been explained, in most cases it has been explained multiple times).1. the fits posted were as close to real-world fits as possible while remaining meaningfully analogous to one another.2. the use of n-types and other named mods was explained.3. the use of rows of fitting mods (in the case of the nighthawk) was not only explained, but it should be self-evident from the title.4. if you have better setups to post using better hardening schemes while still remaining realistic, useful, and similar to other fits then please post them instead of crying.i'll use your ignorance and lack of reading skills as a chance to repost one of the more enlightening setups that put into very clear focus the nighthawk's biggest problem -explain what the above post has to do with fitting, as you put it, 'the biggest guns and launchers'? if you could read you'd understand that the nighthawk can't even fit heavy missile iis and a basic (and rather poor) pvp setup (with no gang mod) without being incredibly short of powergrid.continued."
"i've already reshown, with the assistance of your lack of reading skills and logic, that the nighthawk can't even fit heavy missile iis. the issue has nothing to do with fitting hams. again, my fits are meant to be as closely related to one another while remaing useful and analogous (which a comparison-based problem necessitates).a. other command ships do not require faction gear for useful fits.b. other command ships do not require pg implants for useful fits.c. telling people to use another ship because one is broken is inane, and perfectly illustrates how clueless you are to this issue, and that you are simply trolling.i'll look forward to your posting some numbers, evidence, or fits that provide some actual proof of your uninformed opinion. so far you've done nothing but provide a whiney and unsubstantiated opinion. numbers and examples are sort of useful (sarcasm) when proving and/or disproving problem-solving.as for my posting with an alt - i've already stated this and i'll state it again. any single individual (even one that doesn't play eve) could come into this forum and provide some numbers and evidence of a problem and be entirely correct. accusing me of posting with an alt (which i indeed am) is a nice attempt at a strawman and an ad hominem, but it once again illustrates that you have no evidence or proper argument.ps, however, i do appreciate you bumping this thread, and keeping it on the first page. further responses from you will also be appreciated for the same reason, whether they continue to be devoid of reason or not."
"no one is trying to convince you of anything, merely give other readers a more parsimonious reading the \"great nighthawk imbalance\". you conflate the basic problem of fitting scarcity that every ship in the game is subject to into such an embarrassing metaphysical crisis and think you're perfectly valid on all your tortured readings. i asked for proof of your fits as a means to see what you practically run not as a means to undermine you as i could care less about your person, and you read all my posts as personal attacks, i told you the comparisons of ships and weapons wasn't fair or accurate, you called me illiterate. is everyone flying a nighthawk touting perfect skills? if not surely they too must be making some concessions, which is at the heart of this thread. despite your attempts to remain scholarly and empirical, your hostility and consistent oversimplification of general ship parity to mean identical ship fitting strategies reveals that you are little more than a self-interested partisan."
"a. thanks for the bump.b. the evidence and proof is present to be read, as many have already done.c. you managed to use rhetoric to avoid saying anything of substance, and you managed to, once again, avoid providing a counterargument, facts, evidence, proof, numbers, or fits.d. see a."
"no my good friend it is you who is being combative--my approach has been interrogative from the start but remember you aren't the only audience. you insist on misunderstanding or distorting my initial two premises and as such the rest of my scheme naturally evades you. let me rephrase my point in a different way. to wit, your fundamental position, if it is interested in game balance, is backwards. initially you must evaluate the practical reality and deduce the developer's logic and test those hypotheses rather than abstract hysterically. surely it is no accident that these changes you've been asking for haven't materialized? all your points signify and confirm that the scarcity of fitting is indeed universal to enough of a degree to allow for balance, parity, unique costs to benefits and therefore nothing is amiss. you should be interested in leaving as small a game play footprint as possible unless you are trying to precipitate a genuine and damaging imbalance between the command ships. when your approach is the reverse, you offer much so called evidence to answer leading questions--this is simply dishonest intellectualizing and harmful for game balance."

"five launchers on the nighthawk. no kidding. and you're still using 2 rcu iis. you really think that's sensible? also... the nh needs its lowslots for the same things that other 5-lowslot shield tankers do, such as the raven, maelstrom and, indeed, sleipnir. that is - damage mods, dc, agility and speed mods or lowslot eccm or sensor boosters. or are you advocating halving the sleipnir's pg so it has to fit pg mods in its lows?more! there is no point flying a field command if you do not use a gang mod. otherwise, use a bc or bs. i appreciate that the other field cs have problems fitting a gang mod (apart from the sleipnir really) which i don't believe they should, but we're discussing the nh here, not field cs in general.tanking is not a role. in itself, it is not a useful ability. it is only useful when married to some other ability - such as tackling, in the case of hics, or decent gank. hence, you cannot fit a big tank to a pvp nighthawk and also be a useful pvp ship, because you will neuter its gank."

"the nighthawk is a command ship, it is designed to use a command module, other command ships such as the sleip, absolution, and astarte can fit one with no problem. not to mention, this issue was tackled in the original thread. if the nighthawk must forego the use of a command module in order to be useful, then it should still be equivalent to the other command ships when they do not have to fit one, which is far from the case.ummm, 5 launchers? the nighthawk can fit 6. and your awful 5 launcher nighthawk with no command module still requires 2 rcus. thanks for yet another setup that explains the powergrid issue of the nighthawk.also, for rigs - other command ships do not need to use fitting mod rigs, therefore the nighthawk should not have to use them either.the nighthawk does not have some incredible tank. why people are under this hallucination is beyond me. in fact, the nighthawk, if anything, has a rather average tank.hmmm. let's see, how about nanos, inertial stabs, a third bcu, or even eccm.thanks for your assistance in showing that the nighthawk does indeed need a powergrid boost. i'd honestly never thought of posting a five launcher setup that requires two rcus in order to make the point."
"still waiting on those numbers, evidence, proof, or something remotely similar to a sound argument.however, i'm still thankful for the regular bumps to this thread!"
"do you see any of the other field cmnd ships fitting gang mods? no, it's because they would rather have the extra dps. people fly fleet command ships for the gang mods! i actually ment to type 6launchers not 5. if you use your head then you would of seen that.nighthawk does have a pretty bad tank, dono how you fit it but the way my mates do they can tank a **** load"
"both the abso and the sleip fit them because they have free high slots without hardpoints. neither ship has a hard time fitting one either. the astarte can and does sometimes fit one, depending on the situation. so yes, i see them used (and personally use them) very frequently.regardless, i've pointed it out and you've ignored it, if all the command ships decline to fit a command module then they are far ahead of the nighthawk in fitting possibilities, thanks to the nighthawk's amazing lack of powergrid. the issue isn't a command module's grid requirements. other command ships can fit them with no problem. when only one command ship can't fit one then where do you think the problem lies? with the ship or the module? use your brain.that's interesting, because you typed 5 again in your response after that same post. however, even if it was an accident, show me another command ship that must use 2 fitting mods to fit a full rack of it's lowest powergrid t2 weapons while at the same time forgoing the use of a commnd module. once again you are helping me prove my point.feel free to post some setups showing this amazing tank, because if you actually fly the ship (or throw it into eft) you'll see it has nothing approaching an amazing tank. the sleip can easily fit a command mod, full rack of weapons, an amazing tank using an xl shield booster, damage mods, and nanos with no fitting mod. try that with the nighthawk. thanks. i'll be looking forward to that particular response."

"oh come on, your mates are obviously talking about pve. everyone else knows that sprs and passive-regen tanking are too slot- and cap-intensive to be useful in pvp.the pvp nighthawk having a big tank is a classic eve myth. claiming as such is a good way of showing that you have no idea what you're talking about."

"please be constructive, erotic irony..."
"unfortunately for the trolls, my argument that the nigthawk shouldn't lose grid compared to the drake trumps all their inane excuses.are there any other ships that lose grid like that going from t1 to t2?what is a drake fitting that a nighthawk is supposed to ditch?this chart says all that needs to be said:powergrid of tech 1 bc's compared to tech ii versions:hurricane 1350 --> sleipnir 1460myrmidon 1175 --> astarte 1450harbinger 1500 --> absolution 1575drake 850 --> nighthawk 710 (<---wtf?)"
"to those of you having, er, difficulty, understanding the nighthawk's pg problem, here is a simple comparison. i don't know how i can make the problem any clearer than this. both the sleipnir and nighthawk have similar slot layouts and are fit in similar fashion. one is a good, popular pvp ship that is also extremely viable in a nano configuration. the other has is hopelessly gimped for pg and has a useless precision bonus, making it rarely seen outside its current home of afk-l4 running. sleipnir7x 220mm ii, gang modmwd ii, medium electro cb, lsb ii, sba ii, inv iidc ii, 3x gyro ii, warded ladar backup cluster2x solidifier rigs5x hobgoblin iis (with 15 m3 drone space in reserve).tanks 553 dps (cap lasts 5 minutes with mwd off).deals 547 dps without drones (barrage; 2.7 km optimal, 23 km falloff), 646 dps with drones.nighthawk 3x aml ii, 3x sml ii (yes those are frigate weapons!!!), gang modmwd ii, medium electro cb, lsb ii, photon ii, inv iidc ii, 3x bcs ii, warded gravy backup cluster2x solidifier rigs5x hobgoblin iistanks 588 dps (cap lasts 2 minutes 20 seconds with mwd off).deals 189 dps without drones (cn bloodclaw; missiles can travel 42 km but are largely ineffective against unwebbed targets), 288 dps with drones.we fully appreciate that to fit a gang mod sacrifices should be made. but we believe that the nighthawks currently has to make far too much a sacrifice.there is no reaso for it to have such a low pg, especially on a ship that lacks the flexibility of the sleipnir. the sleipnir is not overpowered, and it is impossible to imagine that a nighthawk with boosted pg will be overpowered."
"if the astarte/abso were to try to fit a gang mod, they would have to gimp the setup, by either dropping to the lowest teir guns, or by dropping what tank they have. they have no cpu/pg to spare on a gang mod.and it's quite easy to hit the 5 button instead of the 6 as they are right by eachother and typing late at night doesnt help either.edit: show me any other command ship that can hit outside 50km."

"what the hell does this have to do with the nighthawk's powergrid?the cerb can hit farther than other hacs.the raven can hit farther than other battleships.see a pattern here?missiles have a built in advantage that compensates for their flight time and below average dps - that advanatage is range, which is a caldari trademark.nice try at going completely off topic though."

"this may or may not be somewhat of a pet issue. i'm not certain if smaller corporations have the same problem but i imagine any corporation over a certain size will run into this situation and i feel it's something that could be addressed.as it stands, as ceo of goonfleet my evemail is unusable. this is because every single corporate going on generates an individual evemail. every time a player joins, an evemail. every time a player leaves, an evemail. every time a pos runs low on fuel, an evemail. every time something is shot, an evemail. essentially this puts me and i'm sure at least a few others in a position where our evemail is completely unusable. it is my assumption that this was not the intended purpose of the evemail system, but rather that the evemail system was intended for communicating. to allow for other players to get in touch with me regarding issues when i'm offline or to initiate diplomatic contact. i would propose that a separate system be used for logging corporate events, be it a log similar to the new kill log, or a separate mail account specific to the corp's needs. there have been a number of times in my case where attempts at communication have gone ignored, including communications from ccp, simply because i cannot at times even open my evemail. it would take a significant amount of time to clean this up, and even should i do so it will be self defeating because i will receive hundreds of evemails a day.essentially i'd like to see these messages going somewhere else so that my evemail can be used for... evemailing. i'm not sure how much support this topic will receive as i'm not sure how widespread a problem it is but in my case it's untenable. thanks!"

"i support new ships. especially for exploration."
"an exploration vessel would be extremely useful for and help develop some of the things introduced as 'mini professions' to people that prefer that sort of game style. after reading one of the csm logs it is discouraging to hear you should not be able to finish most exploration because you are a single player.first off, do you really want to group up and wait for someone to scan for you or waste all your time for the benefit of others? (typically now that i am a ceo i would not say such things but first and foremost i am a player, and exploration was a mini-profession not a group type thing just certain high level complexes in 0.0 and the ones that got moved to the exploration system to avoid exploitation of its resources)there are already exploration sites that are not solo-able but having a ship that would be capable of scanning and a decent chance at running the exploration complex would bridge a giant gap for this game play. not having to tow around multiple ships and all their equipment to do exploration let alone in new and more dangerous areas like 0.0 sov controlled space areas where by standing issues you can't dock at player made stations and having to leave all your stuff out in a open space 'bookmark / safe spot' where it will get deleted.second off using mmo as an excuse everyone should play together for every type of end game type content is weak, especially in a game where you are not encouraged to trust other players. massively multi-player online does not mean you must group up to play, most of the end game features are already centered around groups, like most daily important game features blobs and sov. / conquerorable 0.0 being able to select to do something with others is what makes mmo's great but being forced to group for things is a major stopping point in most games.i am very surprised to see such a useful idea shot down with a minimum of conversation."
"it was really discouraging to see how certain csm candidates refused to look at the game from a larger perspective, but instead just shot down the proposal because they believed that ccp should not spend time increasing solo activity viability and dismissing people that support this issue as lazy.i believe that this proposal would positively impact a large amount of players, as well as making eve a more diverse game. i was amazed that this idea was rejected while many what were in my opinion trivial issues did make it to the iceland agenda. perhaps we'll get another chance of bringing this issue up at a later time, but i'm affraid it's off the list for iceland."
"after reading the chatlogs of the discussion concerning the proposed exploration style ship, it seemed pretty clear that some of the folks didnt have much idea about exploration or just weren't interested in it. especially the 'hey, why don't we make it possible to raid an outpost with a single ship as well?' response to making it easier for explorers to fulfil thier role with a single ship.off the cuff comments like that really show you guys in a bad light and demonstrate a kinda 'it doesn't affect me, i don't care' attitude imo."
"well, it would seem that unless you play the game as they want then you shouldnt play.what a waste."
"i support this idea."
"so. something like a marauder, lots of spare high slots for tractor beams, bonuses to said beams, with the damage, tank, and cargo hold to clear the mission and space to fit a probe launcher?probe launchers aren't class limited, fit them on a marauder and go to work"
"well i liked this idea and i voted for it and tried to persuade people. sorry it failed."
"the \"laziness\" comment is the first thing that made me a bit furious about the csm. you are supposed to represent player interests, not offend us. you can be sure that this will affect my votes next time around.the question you have to ask is, is exploration meant to be work or fun? if it's work, then i simply won't do it for the limited rewards. thank you very much.if it's supposed to be fun, then how can one be \"lazy\"? the current exploration mechanics just aren't appealing to me, and that's quite disappointing after spending a lot of time preparing for it. i didn't do this for the money, but with the idea of having fun. there are better ways for me to make money, so why should i bother?a new ship certainly isn't the only way to make exploration fun, but it would at least have been worth bringing up. i wouldn't want the ultimate ship that makes teamwork completely obsolete. i merely would want a ship that makes deep space exploration at least remotely feasible, without having backup in the vicinity. i quite like the idea of giving astrometrics bonuses to the marauder actually, it would fit perfectly with their \"home away from home\" slogan. and what could be less lazy and more dangerous than flying a 500m flying brick deep into dangerous territory? don't you want players to take more risks? this would have been a great chance."
"i like the idea but i dont think they need any significant damage at all.what they need is probe bonus + tank + medium size + new hull that looks like the one from starcraft.reason: i dont want them to become useful in pvp. really. covops have a defined role and they're good at it, i dont want to see gank covops, where covops pilots are suddenly top of the killmail. at the top of this page was aguy complaining about certain suggestions because they had too few dps (whut?) and asking for basically an ishtar with better tank and a probe bonus (mental!).they need tank to survive the explorations, and bonuses to do science stuff (i.e. the arch, salvage, and hacking) that these exploration sites encourage. if you're coming up with the combat sites, you need to bring a combat ship.so, entirely for example:t1 hull, new, sisters of eve.cruiser sized, 5 high, (3 turret), six mids, five low.600m3 cargo, slow max velocity, but good agility. ship bonuses: 10% bonus to scan speed, 7.5% bonus to armor rep/level. role bonuses: 25% to scan strength, 50% to codebreaker and analyser success chance, 200% bonus to cloaked velocity. thus, tanks nice, can fit bonussed hack/arch plus cap recharge (carebears love passive cap, remember), similar tank to a myrmidon, equal to covops probing + better strength, can hide while scanning but cant warped cloaked. 3guns to clear friggies.there's no way you should be having heavy firepower on these type of ships. if you want to run combat sites you should bring combat firepower, especially the ded plexes and escalations. however, this vessel allows abilities that dont exist (e.g. strength and arch/hack bonuses), overall a cool science-oriented science vessel."
"i was very disappointed this motion failed, and i disagreed with the laziness argument. i feel there is a role for solo explorers in eve and it was a great pity this didn't get through."
"short range = transversal and not hit.long range = just plain damn range and not hitmid range = optimals and death. i think something needs to be done to allow for increased life expectancy in the mid ranges."
"the problem with midrange combat is that you cannot tackle at these ranges in main combat ships. this neccessitates the use of tackler pilots in quick ships or gallente recons. the issue ends up being that you need to put pilots in tacklers instead of battleships, which may not be the most efficient use of pilots, and that you need to have a higher degree of coordination between tacklers and dps, which isn't really a gameplay issue but more of a barrier to entry."

"i was going to post something very similer to this but a lot less elequantly, well done.the trouble with your fix is it seems to me to be dificult to implement from ccp's side and prone to abuse .. for instance you could warp friendly titans to the field, doomsday nothing and then move your capitals and support in knowing that hostile titans will be less effective.what i suggest as a fix is simpler but hopefully just as effective.reduce titans hitpoints to the same kind of level as carriers.at the same time as this increase their ability to tank in excess of motherships. perhaps a 7.5% increase to rep amount and remote rep amount per level and a greater cap ability?this will mean if you have titans on the field and want to instadamage with multiple doomsdays you will pop your titan fleet as well as the enemies capital fleet. this does make titans more vunerable to killing but i think that this is neccesary anyway in relation to their power.you would still be able to out tank normal caps and even motherships and with effective spidertanking this would still make titans very difficult to kill but you reduce the ability to instapop capital fleets.it would still be possible if you could get a titan fleet of the same race and stick to one damage type that your own titan fleet is heavily resisted to but this comes with its own problems and allows the enemy to counter."

"i can completely get behind this idea!"
"i can see the rl logic behind it. two lumberjacks do not cut down a tree in half the time because they get in each other's way and have to coordinate their swings. likewise, projectiles racing toward a ship can get in each other's way, lasers might catch on missiles heading towards the same target and if you blow a hole in a ship just as someone's shooting at that same spot then they're going to go straight through and hit nothing.game balance? well, it seems it's focus-fire or lose these days. i can see the argument.i do not however support nerfing focus fire against bigger ships. tiny little shells against a massive battleship have plenty of places to impact without getting in each other's way."
"so you're basically saying, if you have double the guns you don't have double the firepower?apart from that not making any sense at all, it must be one of the worst ideas i've ever heard.."
"i wholeheartedly support this idea. it will help eliminate the blob warfare that is ruining eve online"
"this would make a blob nearly unkillable, you wouldn't even have to call primaries anymore. a logistic ship here and there, a tank on every ship and bam, you're entire blob is unkillable barring lag."
"absolutely surrealistic, you should die a fiery death if you're being primaried, that's the whole point. if you don't want to lose your ship in pew pew anymore, go nano or go home."
"i propose we get mythbusters in on this. they can have multiple remote-controlled trucks driving past multiple remote-controlled machine guns and see if the speed of stopping the trucks is directly proportional to the number of machine guns."
"what a horrible idea. please stop posting."
"basis for the idea is good enough, it's to easy to do focus fire, no need to position yourself in any way, i agree on that.but your suggestion is unrealistic. a better way would be to introduce a line of fire. if you have a friendly between you and your target, you cannot hit target. also enemies should be able to move in between you and your target, taking all the damage.this will give defenders an advantage, as they can entrench themselves, and attackers a harder time.my idea will also encourage blobbing and put a huge load on the servers, so it's not acceptable."
"eee.... lets make a only first torp from ganking raven hits, rest should not be counted - it should counts only when ur staying on one leg with your mouse raised above your head while screaming \"i love caldari\""
"line of sight is the only viable solution. but it is not viable to be implemented because of high cost on hardware power."
"worst idea ever."
"what a load of old twaddle. sounds like the whining of someone who got ganked if you ask me."
"whining about focused fire is so 2006.there are other ways to deal with blob warfare. like functional non-titan aoe as a blobbing deterrant."
"dreadful.1) op states a solution without stating and explaining the problem(1b. the problem here doesnt actually exist).2) op seems to be operating on a different planet (\"you actually like the current setup??\"... well, yeah, obviously)(2b. suggest the op hasnt actually got sufficient combat experience to comment, but cant i cant prove that)3) focussed fire is a vital part of the combat paradigm in eve. nerfing it makes about as much sense as nerfing warp drives, stargates or targeting."
"see this? this is where the support would be......but it's not."
"see, two missiles erradicate the existence of said tree into nothingness in half the time one does."
"ship trails are always something i enjoy watching. they give the game a certain complexity.in homeworld, ship trails were actually modded pretty heavily as players found them aesthetically pleasing.when trinity hit tq, all ship trails were nerfed to some extent in both classic and premium. i don't know if the game was given a huge \"multiply\" filter for trails etc, but their visibility was taken away at longer ranges, making drones harder to track (sort of) and with ships that accelerated quickly you had no visual reference as to how fast they were moving without glancing at the overview.don't get me wrong, i fly by the overview. but sometimes actually seeing the game field is helpful too. i just see this as an unnecessary visual nerf (let's face it, it has nothing to do with lag, and you can disable client trails via the esc menu anyway)."
"im not sure, but im guessing they got nerfed to increase performance, if thats the case wich one is the heaviest - performance or aesthetics?"
"moot point. you can disable trails in the esc menu, as i said."
"performance hits are server side, not client side."
"yeah, i noticed it too. it is really a very minor detail, but i'll give my support to this one."

"i support this, not because i think t2 bpo owners have an unfair advantage, but because it creates cost inequalities which increase the barrier to entry of invention.in addition, if you actually own a t2 bpo and support this, you can put your money where your mouth is and trash it, you can even wait until you've gotten \"max runs\" out of it or whatever your proposal would entail."
"with these changes it seems more like a nerf nano-ship thread, trying to be disguised as a helpful \"encourage more mid-range combat\" thread. mid-range combat does exist, just look at any long range cruiser set ups (40-60km).and when making suggestions like these try to see the ramifications of the suggestion and how it would effect a ship or type of ship please.p.s. tarminic if your intention was not a nerf nano then please forgive me if my opinion sounds harsh"
"a lot wrong with this. sniper ships can easily load short range t1 ammo and do massive amounts of damage at 40-60km. but why? you are so much more vulnerable to getting bubbled or tackled.non-faction webs have a max range of 10km, not 12km, and they can be overloaded to 13km.how would a 30km scram promote fighting at 40-60km. they can just warp off so wtf does that do?mid-range combat is actually quite available using standard in-game tactics. all you need is to drop a bubble/interceptors on the opponent and you can go out to any engagement range you desire. hacs/bcs can hit quite well at 40-60km and are very effective as they can be much more mobile than a bs group. so yeah, your proposal doesn't show how your changes will promote 40-60km fighting and sounds like you want to nerf something else. 20km webs and 30km scrams doesn't sound like it will have any bearing on 40-60km fights for obvious reasons."
"i do agree with the webs a bit and with the scramblers a little less than that :-)mid range combat takes place in medium gang sizes, where the tackler and primary damage dealers are short ranged ships while all the support is mid ranged so they don't need to travel (or at least not that much) to apply damage on the target.solo mid-range was never viable due to dps limits and fleet mid range is also stupid due to usual fleet ranges being 2x the longest mid-range ..."
"no problem, after writing it i could easily see how it could negatively impact nanoships, thus my note at the bottom. though i do think that the prevalence of nanoships alone and in small gangs is too high, that wasn't the intention of the post although it would be a side effect. this may speak to my recent inexperience as a pvper then. i've never been in a fight that's taken place over a range longer than 15-20km.p.s. am i allowed to support my own topic?"
"well i am no pvper myself. but my limited 0.0 experience tought me to rely on mid range and stay out of harms way :-) it has a few benefits:1. easier to stay out of bubbles2. faster target switch as there is less distance to travel3. the best option for a caldari specced character :-)4. option to pick alternate targetssmall gangs don't have the player resources to separate roles, so you have to do all (tackle, tank, damage). thus they are 99% short range.medium sized gangs do have the luxury of numbers, so you can safely ignore the tackling part and fit for range and damage (with a little tank if left alone). usualy that's the best options for missile ships and mid-range snipers (moa, ferox, munnin, zealot etc.).fleets are very dedicated in their roles and mid-range is not one that works there.also for mid-range to work properly, you'd need a mechanic to keep your target longer at that range. webs are unfair, because they work from 0 to max of their range with same efficiency. in fact there is no effect in eve that does not work at closer range but works at longer range (not talking about usability but about effect)."
"(disclaimer: i am an armchair tactician too.)there are some interesting ideas here, although i'm not sure that mid-range combat is \"broken\" enough to need \"fixing.\" that said, though, a and c sound reasonable. i remember seeing a nice thread about slightly buffing abs and/or slightly nerfing mwds a while ago.b and d could be seriously unbalancing, though, but you're right in thinking that they're necessary to get combat occurring at greater range. making webs and scrams effective at longer ranges makes them more powerful, and broadly speaking they don't need to be more powerful - they're doing their job fine already. perhaps instead of extending the range of all scrams and webs, introduce new scrams and webs that can operate at greater range - but make them harder to fit (grid- or cpu-wise) or operate (cap-wise), except on certain ships which could get bonuses to their use."
"it would be nice to see longer ranged scrambling, but the problem lies in how to implement it. either it costs more to fit, costs more to use, or the whole warp core strength thing is completely re-done.maybe make bigger ships gradually harder to scramble, starting with 0 strength for frigates and destroyers, 1 strength for cruisers and battlecruisers, and 2 strength for battleships. then another jump for carriers and dreads, up to the 'invulnerability' of supercaps. then you could use a longer ranged, less intense scrambler on weaker ships, but require more for larger ships with more sophisticated warp systems.interceptors could get a role bonus of +2 warp core scrambling, and whatnot.i just ramble a lot."
"the webber strength being affected by sig radius is interesting. although i could see a problem with the disparity between a large slow ship trying to web a smaller faster ship (which even with the sig radius increase from the mwd would still be smaller than its target) - in a gang situation wouldn't that mean the smaller faster ship could tackle even more easily with less threat of being counter-webbed and blown up?still it seems like something that could be tuned with specific numbers, if you combined it with different range on webbers (or better, a falloff for webbers where their effectiveness fades out at higher distances).maybe the stasis webifier section could be reposted as its own issue though?"
"hell yes! other than the rorqual, it's been a long time since miners got some love. i'd like to see some real incentive to getting out in 0.0./signed"
"as somebody who is basically a carebear, i heartily endorse this idea. the lolqual was an insult to industrialists, and it's high time we get some attention.this may help the macro-miners, but there are other ways to go about hindering them rather than helping them. my idea about periodic high-security raids, as well as other ideas such as asteroid veins, will hinder their activities.i do run missions, and the removing all t1 loot from it will hurt me slightly. however, if you increase bounties to compensate, i see no problem with that idea.about being able to build anything in the game, that would require what would essentially be an industrial rewrite rather than a modification. we should be able to produce bpos by copying if we devote the appropriate amount of time, but i don't see that getting rid of bpos completely, unless we do something related to invention for t1 bpos."
"supporting, because moar carebears = moar targets"
"i think that the best way to incentivize industry is to give industrialists more options when it comes to the use of their skills.being able to use industry and trade skills to improve what you can do with business inside of a station, for producing the goods or whatever option ccp will leave open.either way, supported."
"i'd really like to see new ore types, the long over do system wide roid fields, and or roid fields you need to scan for.perhaps even require those in mining barges/exhummers to be in a corp (not a newb corp) to fly them, so that other players can wardec the macro miners blow them up solve the problem.change the respawn amount in roid fields would be nice.just my two isk."
"i think the op meant new stuff for industry, not a nerf to industry.op supported."
"even though i am a 0.0 vet and a pirate i thoroughly support this topic in all its glory"
"there seems to be some contention on the forums and in the csm itself in its chatlogs, as to how the csm meetings can be better conducted (as evidenced by comments about chairmanship, talk of \"no confidence,\" etc.).i suggest formally adopting robert's rules of order, which is the basis for debate in most legislative, committee, and corporate meetings all over the world. most organizations use some simplified version of it, since it can be rather unwieldy for small groups, but it balances the rights of individuals while keeping the meeting on track. since the csm has trouble holding an informal meeting, the csm should use a simplified form of robert's rules of order.see rulesonline.com or robertsrules.org for the proverbial whole nine yards."
"i meant to start this thread last night, but got too caught up in the drama threads. yes - adopt rro asap, and put 90% of this stupid procedural bickering behind us."
"yup best idea to date tbh."
"\"all remarks must be directed to the chair. remarks must be courteous in language and deportment - avoid all personalities, never allude to others by name or to motives!\"this will never work."
"heh.nevertheless, supported."
"agreed, but we'll also need a way to add \"house rules\" as the csm's usually meet online not in a room. this difference may warrant changes. but given how little guidance ccp has offered to date, it a good starting structure. it would also avoid stupid statements like a vote of 4 for, 2 abstained and 2 against being ruled as voted down, when robert's notes abstain votes go to the majority (iirc)."
"supported, i read in this weeks notes how one rep found it important to interrupt constantly. could have taken an hour off the 4 hour meeting from that alone...."
"in practice, most bodies that use these rules use them very loosely (like company board meetings and community organizations); they only need be invoked when ignoring them is causing problems. when a situation is obviously contentious, they're very helpful in keeping things fair.(and oh yeah, obviously supporting my own topic here)"
"/agree"
"agreedi kinda assumed the csm would be following this sort of thing from day one anyway but takes all sorts i guess."
"those websites are the most recent pre-1923 versions, since they're the only ones in the public domain. modern rro books have provisions for meetings by alternate technical means, which should be close enough to chat channels as to make no difference. i assume the chair would go out and buy/bittorrent a modern copy of rro or something, for this purpose."
"agreed"
"this is a must.even just to make it easyer to track each csms input on issues.big fat hairy support for this."
"what the hell? the csms aren't supposed to be debating anything. the people present opinions on what needs to be presented to ccp, the csms vote, then they move on to the next issue. the only debate that should take place is here in the forums, not in the meetings. the csm members need to manage their time better, and the latest meeting was clear and decisive proof of that."
"i agree"
"i don't mean this is an agressive or dirisory tone at all but what do you think the csm is there for at all if not to discuss an issue? i mean if we just talk about it here and they forward it on to ccp then there is no need for them as ccp can easily let us talk for a while and every six months add up what got the most support and talk about it themsleves."
"we have now had three disastrous meetings of the csm. chatlogs have been released and yet we still have yet to receive a single set of minutes of the meetings.this is clearly unacceptable considering the importance these csm proceedings hold for all eve subscribers. the chatlogs themselves are inadequate, badly formatted and in a horrible format (why rtf why).finding the votes on a particular issue is almost impossible or even whether an issue was voted on at all."
"do you really need minutes for the weekly fiasco?10 jade loses the plot20 goto 10"
"that is beside the point. minutes are meant to be produced for every meeting. they have not been. qed, fire the stupid bint in charge of making the minutes and get someone who can tell which end of the pen makes the ink go on the paper."
"is it ccp or is it the secretary that decided that the meetings should be held in text chat? im not sure but i suspect its ccp.since your issues seems to be whit how the meetings are beeing held, i think you should make a new thread and suggest a new method, personaly i think they should get a internal forum where they can discuss things instead of text chat, that would make it much more organized."
"there are chatlogs? where?"
"my issue is that the promised minutes of the meetings are not available three weeks after the first meeting. chatroom meetings are fine however the way the chatlogs are distributed is stupid."
"not supported.from what i understand, the minutes of the meetings have been completed and sent to ccp for distribution however, for whatever reason, ccp has yet to post them up despite having promised the csm that they would within 7 days of the meeting.therefore the problem in this case lies with ccp and not the secretary."
"i have honored my duties and sent the minutes to ccp within the timeframe given in the csm document to the best of my abilities.ccp has failed to release them to the public.see last meeting's chatlog.proctoheliosis, what format would you prefer for the minutes? rtf was chosen because it is platform independant. keep in mind that mac and linux users wish to read it as well. i'd rather hear your input and suggestions instead of only complaining how whatever we do is wrong."
"how about a god damned text file? rtf is a horrible format. it's also not completely cross platform. for example opening it on my computer gives me the logs in a greek font. i have to manually change it to read them.the three column tabbed format means the interesting portion (what was said) is only a third of the page wide making the logs multiple pages long for no reason.and if what you say is true and ccp has failed to release the minutes you have sent them then perhaps it shows just how little they care about the csm process."
"i would like to see the chatlogs released in a csv format so we can rearrange columns for readability. in fact i might just go and write a script to convert them."
"as pointed out already, the problem isn't ankh. she's doing a great job."
"much unlike mistress jade constantine"
"this ^^also, has anyone else noticed that this happened between two roleplayers? just putting on a tinfoil hat here, but meh.roleplayers should not roleplay during the csm in my opinion."
"allthough jade isnt doing it good atm, i think it is way too easy to just put all the blame on jade. anyone who ever done an msn conversation with 10 people know it is impossible, so why would this work?"
"this is your first formal warning. do not disrupt this thread with your arguments."
"i lol'd."
"oh noes lol"
"please cancel your subscription. unplug your keyboard. turn off you computer and never return.kthxbyte"
"to be frank; given the time and geographical issues and what i have just read; it is a miracle anything is going to happen.ok. pro tips. your secretariat should prepare an agenda and meeting papers in support of that agenda (ccp should support this). every item on that agenda should have a resolution in clear, short terms setting our the proposed decision. sorry, but that rules jade out from writing any resolutions if an item is just for information; then record the decision as noted.never use msn for meetings. use voice and secretariat records. deliberations of the council and consideration need to be kept private as you may be privy to game design issues.draft agenda1. quorum (including choosing a chairman if it rotates)2. acceptance of previous minutes3. matter arising from previous meeting(discussion about issues that have been raised from previous meetings)4. general businessa - ccp reportreport from ccp detailing significant matters of relevance. a document put together (a report) covering an agreed set of matters. tabled for discussion and noting. if you cannot trust any member; simply warn them what will happen. and make it clear that they will be hounded across the world with litigation.b - proclamationsa review of proclamations to determine which ones have the most support and a reference to ccp for issue evaluation and management.resolved: that ccp be requested to formally advise the committee as to its considerations on \"pos warfare - flogging the dead horse\"that puts ccp under pressure to formally state its case in writing to you guys evaluating the pros and cons. if the paper is any good then you can seek permission to table it and then put it on these forums for everyone to see.c - assembly hallnote the status of issues and summarise the discussions.d - other businessit's easy, if you plan and prepare. and document for everyone to see. where actions are requested; secretariat follows up!"
"thanks for your well reasoned response to this thread. however, i will have to give you a formal warning for using kthxbyte, a misspelled catchphrase."
"its all good, problem is we've been told we have to use in-game chat and as i think you can see from the last meeting - that is a very problematic medium given the personalities and timescale involved. i'd be much happier using voice chat of course - but we will need to get ccp to sign off on that."
"no one wants to listen to your whiny voice for 4 hours while you pontificate about how important you are. especially if you talk as verbosely as you post."
"on the csm website. bookmark it, as it doesn't seem to be linked from anywhere on this site.edit: ankh is doing a very good job, and the delay is caused by ccp. they do have this whole factional warfare expansion to push out the door tomorrow, but that's not an excuse to ignore a process that they themselves installed and deem important (the csm stuff).they're a multi-department organization, they should be able to deal with multiple things at the same time. and none of that soon business is acceptable either, imo."
"jesus wept.tell ccp to wake up to themselves. chat logs ffs. if that's how they run their business then they deserve to go bankrupt. voice comms and then get it transcribed if you have too. but not that tripe. um, guys, fundamental rule of meetings. if you are not there; you cannot vote and if the vote is carried on the voices and a quorum is present; too bad, so sad. any other way is anarchy. it encourages people to be on time!what's with this moved and carried crap? just move a motion, bring out the critical points and vote; once moved its a resolution and binding. topic closed. next item. (not really but it works best that way)chairman should not vote. they have a vote in the event of a tie.agenda's look like they are not working well and the chairman needs to stick to the agenda. your secretary needs more support from ccp to build a worthwhile agenda and supporting papers.chairman's task is to facilitate debate over the agenda items not participate. you really need to stick to the agenda and only open up for new items under new business. if people wander away and make spurious motions; ***** slap them and let them loose under general business.get people to state the nub of their case and what they want. if they cannot say it simply and quickly; get them to prepare a paper for the next meeting; if the issue needs more work but sounds valid; get ccp to do the supporting work.meetings are for decisions; not for in-depth discussions. papers and presentations should contain the meat of the issues.i notice that people are all saying they have to visit iceland for one day; um, interesting for people in the lower half of the southern hemisphere. that's a 5 day trip; 4 spent on planes! i guess half the world is ruled out of ccp's democracy! use videoconferencing"
"ankh is fine, the problems with minutes and such are ccp's fault."
"to be clear, you may want to give your definition of \"table.\" that may sound like an odd request, but the phrase has contradictory meanings in different societies, and historically it has caused much confusion and trouble in diplomatic encounters. it's a colloquialism that generally should be avoided in international meetings."
"hey, my voice is sexier than yours you damned forum alt!"
"eh?? slab of wood with legs nailed on, isn't it? * * note, to the table purist, those monstrosities made of metal and plastic are not considered 'true' tables, although at first glance they might appear to have the same form, and indeed, function. in extremis, stone may be considered as an alternate material."
"ank is doing fine, i do not agree with her views, but she is in the right spot i think. until something else happens that would change that. she needs to be a bit more organized and prepared before the meeting. she gets a little distracted though out the meeting from time to time but that's because i think she is focusing on a couple things at once tbh."
"your voice is awful"
"says the man who burst into tears on our vent after we criticized the fleet warfare capabilities of goonswarm ... lol."
"i don't support this. ankh is doing a fine job.jade, please stop trolling assembly hall threads, at least pretend you take csm seriously."
"i take the serious threads very seriously. i pay the non serious threads the respect they deserve. i hope it won't hurt your feelings if i laugh at the monster trunks / titans thread next?"
"yes, imo nano ships is the only counter to 200km falcons.flying around in low sec in a small gang with a sniper fitted bs for killing falcons isnt a good solution, id recomend nano ships instead tbh.90% of the fights in low sec is at the same gates and stations."
"i hate falcons, you need to have at least as many people in gang as the falconn have jammers +1 (so 6-7), and in the meantime your gang is getting slaugthered dead. so most gangs our corp puts togethere are in the 5-10 man range, meaning that we got no ability to counter the falcons. now, here are the counters to nano ships (which people claim are uncountrable):1. heavy neuts2. curse/sentinel3. rapier/huginn/hyena4. good tracking medium range guns5. cerberus and other high-speed missile ships6. ecm ships7. damp ships8. tracking distruptor ships9. doomsday10. remote repping bs fleet11. warrior iis12. faction webs/officer webs13. nano ships14. webbing drones (really, they work... kinda)15. high alpha shipshere are the counters against the falcon:1. falcon2. doomsday (not possible in low-sec)in addition this is what you can do to mitigate the effect (note, non of these counters):1. bigger blob2. eccmnow, how many of the falcon counters and mitigations seems reasonable for a small low-sec gang?if you need a specific ship to counter another specific ship, something is wrong."
"falcons are fine its just the ecm effect that ppl do not like and falcons have become the target of all that frustration.don't blame the falcon blame your choices in gang members and ships and your decision to engage a gang you know you cannot hurt with your particular setup."
"what do you expect a 3 man gang to achieve? you have no diversity (as you don't have the numbers) and flexibility. your 3 man gang is only safe to take out at most solo or 2 ship gangs of inferior qualities. or you pick your targets very wisely in which case you still need a forward scout.in your case even a lousy blackbird will be more ecm than you can handle. so it is not a falcon is overpowered issue.as i said, don't nerf a ship because of your lack of preparation or resource. would you ask for a carrier nerf if one was dropped right on top of you?"
"it is quite common for experienced pvp corps to fight gangs twice their own size.it has been mentioned several times in this thread why a falcon cannot be compared to a bb or even a rook, and we are not discussing the ecm strength.this thread has nothing to do with lack of preperation, lack of resource or even carriers. it would be nice if you could stay on topic and keep a civilized tone."
"the stupidity of this post offends me."
"this makes sense - but are there any situations where a corp might not want the standings to change automatically? (i can't think of any off the top of my head, but you never know) maybe instead of it being automatic there could be a \"align standings to alliance\" button or something."
"the only situation i could think of, is that the corp has a spy in an enemy corp or alliance, and their own alliance doesn't know about it.in which case, mirroring alliance standings, and then having any corp standings override the alliance mirror.do people even set their spies blue? i don't know anything about that sort of thing anyhow. still, mirroring is a good idea."
"ugh i have found this a problem...supported!"
"as a ceo, i respect my alliance's standings (for the most part) but there are standings that are unique to my corporation. we have one corporation that operates in the same patch of lowsec we do and they've agreed not to fire on dfias and we've agreed not to fire on them. that doesn't meant hat all of our alliance is blue to them, nor should it. most of our alliance doesn't fly in that region's lowsec.there was an incident where one corporation was kicked from the alliance we were in, due to personal squabbles between that corp's ceo and the executor of the alliance in question. we did not agree with the action and refused to attack our friends in the corp that got kicked. the alliance had them set to -10.0 red (which was childish). dfias had them set to +5.0 blue.corp standings are not personal standings are not alliance standings and that is as it should be. if you can't handle outpost management, then pass the torch to somebody else in your alliance who can handle it."
"csm chair should only be allowed to mute someone, if there is a majority call from the other representetives present to do so."
"disagree - it's the chair's job. the problem here is that the chair abused powers he rightfully had, not that he invented powers he didn't."
"it's not his job to silence any of the csms from discussion. he has no right to silence another elected official. nobody but ccp has that authority."
"the chair is an organizer. nothing more is defined anywhere. muting people in the discussion channel was never granted, therefore it was invented."
"sure."
"the chair has the right in any discussion to end any disruption to the order of the meeting."
"not in my opinion. this is a council of equals. not a lord and its subjects. also there wasn't any disruption to the meeting in question."
"the chair is mad with power and defines disruption as anything they disagree with. what now?"
"the chairperson has all the formal administrative powers that being a chairperson grants; those powers are not up for debate. traditionally a chairperson has the power to silence or even eject any member of the body who, in the chairperson's opinion, is disrupting the meeting. any such decision of the chair can be appealed to the body and overturned by a 2/3 majority vote.(and by \"traditionally\" i mean according to robert's rules of order, which is the basis for the rules of debate in most legislative, committee, and corporate meetings all over the world.)sorry, no support."
"adopting some already established rules of order is certainly...in order."
"this is a terrible idea and will be sure to bog down csm meetings even further. you simply can't have every single detail or your process be wrangled over by the majority. you need a moderator who keeps things in line and who keeps things moving. aren't any of you familiar with robert's rules of order?"
"try calling somebody a liar in parliament, and you'll get thrown out by the speaker. try bellowing out of turn in just about any body anywhere, and you'll eventually be thrown out by the chair. you aren't thrown out by the election commission, the president/crown, or anyone else, you're thrown out by the presiding member chosen from your own ranks. if someone starts posting cut and paste spamspamspamspamspamspamspamspam every second, i *want* the chair to mute them. i just think that the chair should limit his use of such powers to situations that actually warrant them, rather than abusing them to silence an opponent who was just questioning what was going on."
"since it's kinda what we've been talking about here, here's a proposal to introduce robert's rules to formalize the powers of the chair and the rights of individual members of csm."
"no they do not. sorry. i hate to break it to you but this isn't space parliament."
"if it is or if its not is the point in question tbh and i support the rule of law or tradition on this matter, the fact is that the forms must be observed or every meeting will degrade into a shouting match where everybody talks/types and nobody listens. it is a chairpersons right and his/her place to police the discussions and censor or reprimand the individuals if he feels a breach of the rules is occurring. a formal protest may be made about the decision but should not be done while that session is in conference so not to disrupt it further."
"robert's rules are used by every body, aside from elected legislatures who have enough time to establish their own, that i've ever seen. and even in those bodies, the chair has the right to eject members who are misbehaving sufficiently. the right to temporarily eject members under certain circumstances is a universal right of the chair of an assembly, and should be here as well."
"if only there were a document which could have laid out all these rules and procedures...look, in my opinion ccp should have laid all this out. now we're dealing with the results of that. i'd be perfectly happy to abide by any rules that were fair, but that's simply not where we stand today and shoehorning in rules isn't going to change past abuse or give me any confidence that they'll actually be rendered in an evenhanded fashion.there's no reason why people can't just have a dialog about spaceships today without people being bullied or muted. that's a personal choice. that ability was never explicitly granted and with good reason."
"i bolded the important part for you. the assumption here is that the chair is able to exercise sound judgment. this is not the hand we've been dealt."
"the real problem lies with the whole idea tbh.you put together a group of ppl who volunteered to represent the most self important, petty minded, moaning, complainers and whiners in eve, and i include the members in that group. then you give the group a little authority and then give a individual authority within that group.i'm surprised its not been reduced to hair pulling and name calling sooner tbh."
"oh, granted. i'm defending the position, not the occupant."
"no support.anyone voting for a chairperson should do their best to recall that the traditionally defined job of a chairperson is to officiate and supervise the intended meeting. that indeed means to silence or even eject a member whom they believe is being disruptive.if people dislike how a chairperson conducts meetings, or disagrees with the chairperson's individual take on what defines 'disruptive', then they need to vote for a different chairperson in the next election, or rules need to be written in regarding an impeachment due to no confidence."
"this pretty much sums up my feelings. in the beginning of this whole thing i was rather excited about the whole thing. i thought that maybe, just maybe, this was being taken seriously by ccp and there was some chance that this could. despite the obvious problems a system likes this has, do some good for the community. not star fraction, not freespacers, not small gang pvpers, not pvpers heck but everyone. i had hoped that there would be some great debates on issues that affect everyone in the game. and then we come to what it is now. arguments over the details of how the csm should be running. the policies of how the csm runs should not be set by the csm for reasons that i think are pretty obvious. ccp should have given all members of the csm a clearly defined set of guidelines to work from and their acceptance of the role as a csm members should have be on the proviso that they accept and stick to these rules. instead what we ended up with is, from what i can see, little or no guidance on any issue pertaining to the running of the csm. the attitude shown by ccp in this whole affair is nothing short of pathetic and they should just own up and say they have no intention of putting an ounce of work into running it than is required at the bear minimum. i mean the minutes haven't been put on-line for goodness sake! it's not like it is a more than 5 minute job for someone. in the end i feel sorry for each of the csm members having been duped by ccp into do a staggering amount of work on this with nothing in return being given to help make the ride that much smoother. i feel sorry for those who voted who have to read chat logs of procedural nonsense than should never have come up in the first place. we voted for people to represent us and our views not to try and find a way for a committee to run in an internets spaceship game. i would be surprised if the csm managed to get anything that we want to be done in the first term because setting up the core principles of a committee like this between a diverse group of people is a nightmarish idea at best. should someone be muted? should someone have the power to do so? should a majority of the voters or the majority of the non-abstaining voters count? should a rep be allowed to vote in absence through a proxy? all these and more i would have expected ccp to have set in stone before they even thought of opening up the vote to elect members to a committee.tl;dr version: it's ccp's fault for not caring about the csm enough to provide even the most basic guidance please stop blaming jade, darius, ank etc. etc."
"i'll blame jade for not acting like an adult when he's dealing with grown-ups, though i agree with it being ccp's fault the csm is spending the majority of their time ironing out how the csm is supposed to function as a group."
"i don't know how well jf logistics work at present, and it's possible this would be overpowered somehow, but if it isn't then this seems pretty reasonable."
"hmmm, i quite like this. jump freighters were worried about as being \"overpowered\" but they're still not popular, partly due to price. they are very nice in size, jump range and fuel cost per m3, but lacking in versatility, especially with the versatility of the smaller but tougher and slotted rorqual. this might add a nice twist to them. there doesnt seem to be a downside, as its nothing to do with normal caps, its not going to change the dynamics of 0.0 logistics, which is where jumpfreighters were worried about being too good...the only slight isuses are 1) the agility bonus, which is pretty useless if they never have to gate-jump again. 2) they'd never gate jump again,. why have a ship that can gate jump when nobody will use it because if they were gate jumping, they ought to be in a normal freighter for safety."
"supported."
"sounds like a good idea to me, what would come of the rorqual as it isnt exactly combat :)"
"i believe this is a valid thing to look at, however it makes jump freighters virtually immune to hostility. right now, the only way to kill a jump freighter is with a well-planned high-sec gank, a war dec. (which means it will stay docked if the owner is smart) or when it jumps to get back to high-sec. you have to be willing to take at least some risk with using a jump freighter otherwise its equivalent to re-instating interbus and have everything magically moved for you at cost. granted, this is a concern, not a necessity, because id love to have them! ill reserve support until someone can logic through that concern and how it will affect game balance.fake edit: dont forget that black ops ships can use gates as well and enter high-sec (and jump from high-sec). if you make this, it would be valid to allow them to use them as well."
"this makes jf's overpowered in the since that they could buy low in rens and then take one, maybe 2 jumps to jita to sell, talk about mega logistics, if you can make 300 mil isk in 2 jumps then thats very fast isk, i dont support it, and think this should go in the features and ideas forum till its more refined, though i dont think it will ever really make it onto the drawling board..."

"/sign"
"supported.main reason being to streamline the voting process as with this you only need to post once as opposed to spamming up the thread with additional signed posts from each of your alts.also, voting rights for an account should be tied to a single \"main\" character, no voting with the other characters on the account to pad a vote. once you pass your alt account vote to your main, the alt account should also not be able to vote (though the alt account can always retract it's permissions at any time, stripping it's vote from the main's in any topic the vote's been used for and becoming eligable to vote again with that account's main character.)just need to add a line to the character details that is always visible (unlike the corp/alliance ticker) so your details will end up looking like this, for example:-redlioncaldaripolaris projectcuratores veritatis alliancerepresents (x) accounts (where x is equal to the number of accounts you hold votes for)edit: could also be a good dea for building on the turnout for the csm elections themselves as many said that they just didn't vote with all of their alt accounts because they found it difficult to get in to vote even once."
"first of all id like to get off on a positive note. i hate carebears with a burning passion and belive that they are only here to serve the greater players (a.k.a anyone who has actually used a weapon on another player(ingame ofc))now i understand ccp feeling the need to put up a player council so they could say \"hey we did it first screw u wow\" and they could pull in more subscirbers by promising \"your votes will count\" and all that crap but star wars galaxies beat you too it with their galatic reps or w/eanyways the point being that csm is faulty because they do not represent the full eve community. my reasoning behidn this is:1.there is not 1 pirate representative.2.there is not a merc representative (sry if im wrong on this 1)there may be afew 0.0 alliances reps but they will be outweighed by the carebears. this will unfortunately lead too...1. the nerfing of wars (1 war dec per corp or some crap like that) 2.concord in low sec (comon lets face it carebears will whine until they are safe everywhere in eve)3.the eventual death of lo sec pvp (its bad atm)what i propose is to totally wipe clean the current csm comitte as its kinda obvious they rent getting along anyway (im looking at you jade)and if they do bring it back they should have it split so every group has a fair representation. i dont care who got the most votes as carebears far outnumber the pvpers (however if it wasnt for pvpers carebears wouldnt have anyone 2 sell their stuff 2 now would they) so what i propose is.15 seats minimum3-mining 3-missioning 3-0.0 alliances 3-mercs/empire war 3-piratesthis means that pretty much all the groups get a fair rep rather than just the carebears and afew 0.0 alliances (which is what it is now)also please ppl stop posting crappy ideas (no they arent going to nerf nano, no they arent going to nerf blobs (well maybe...)no they arent going to nerf titans,t2 bpos,motherships etc) now i understand that many of you will object to this as you want the entire of csm to be controlled by carebears but it will lead to your demise eventually along with all of eve....."

"the votng system is extremely unfairsince carebears have a misguided view of pirates thinking them exploiters and omgyouwouldntgethisinwowhowcantheykillmewhinewhinewhinethey will all vote for the carebears so....... if a well respected pirate went up for csm they would get maybe 1/100 of the entire eve population voting for them if all the pirates banded together and voted..."
"pirates vote for pirates and carebears for carebears. that is democracy, welcome to it.and reading your post, i can understand when carebears have those feelings.yeah uhm, right. you are sick. this is based on what exactly? your imagination?most carebears dont give a crap about low sec. only thing they want is that idiots like you stop being an idiot and just let them be happy without telling them they are wrong for not going into low sec.there are 2 reasons low sec pvp is almost dead:1. no reward in low sec compared to high sec2. gatecamping + 'pirates' who only fight when they outnumber targetsnone of these problems are due to carebears.and your definition of fair is kinda flawed. lets do that irl, i know how we can split country in 2 groups during election: one group is me, other group is everyone else. and of course both groups should get same ammount of representatives...oh and yeah, before you flame me, i do pvp."
"are you using \"carebear\" to describe industrialists and people who does pve in general?because that isn't true. many people go into these things to fuel their pvp habbits. same is true for me."
"often \"carebears\" put up alot more risk then normal players, especially on the industrial side. but anyway, issues are brought up here and talked about in neutrality so list your pirate issues and if enough agree it will get discussed."
"doesn't hardin have a pirate background? i thought he mentioned that. lavsita does. but being a roid hugger does not disqualify me from my views of pvp. what determines a \"carebear\"? do look at there character sheet and say. hmm well this guy is a carebear? or is it by his platform? or should they claim \"pirate\" \"0.0\" (industrialist/carebear\" like being nominate green party, republican or dem?"
"well if you consider me setting up the privateers and burn eden alliances then yes - maybe but seriously i have been a dedicated anti-pirate right back to the good old days in sarum primehowever while my 'roleplay' character may be a hardcore pirate hater i personally recognise the value of pirates to this game - and would never support anything that would see the profession wiped out. hell verone wouldn't let me!"
"ok well aslong as there are atleast 1 or 2 reps but i still think my original csm plan is teh sexest"
"::facepalm::"
"we've seen the chatlogs of the single-chatroom-based csm meetings so far...objectively i'll comment that they're getting quite...messy.the reality of such meetings is that one has to deal with factors such as typing time and the fact that 8 or so people might want to talk at the same time - this is common knowledge. regarding my personal experience, i've 'chaired' such styles of meetings in my own alliance with about 12-15 people in attendance, and they've always gone over an agenda quite swiftly - using only chat much of the time. there should be two channels where all the csm members are attending, one taking the role of the 'floor' and the other taking the role of a 'draft' channel. the 'floor' channel is moderated, and the 'draft' channel is unmoderated.the 'floor' is moderated, and represents the area where discussion actually occurs. speakers recognised by the moderator can be allowed to speak, and at the discretion of the moderator, more people can be recognised and the floor discussions take the form of a dialogue. the purpose of the 'draft' channel is for csm members to state that they wish to discuss something or enter a current discussion/that they have an objection/that they have a question. the reason this is useful is it allows the moderator to organise the speakers into a logical order, rather than the floor becoming a shouting match.in the meetings i have held, the 'draft' channel is actively monitored by the moderator. however in the case of the csm, it would seem that it be more appropriate for the vice-chair to monitor the draft channel and organise speakers while the chair moderates statements and dialogue in the 'floor' channel.accountability is not lost - dual chatlogs can show how long speakers are waiting for their voices to be heard and whether ideas are given reasonable time for discussion till voting. since the draft channel is unmoderated the speakers have to self-moderate to allow the vice-chair to pick up on who wants to take the floor.naturally this system may have many avenues for refining, but i think the core message towards improving the csm meetings is adopting a 'dual-channel' system.please state any improvements you believe this proposal can take on and i will edit them as in as addendums when i next check it.i would like to propose that the method we use be adopted by the csm to help them get things done."
"oh and i like my idea :p"
"this is a pretty good idea. although it kind of appeared as though there was some sort of established system for declaring you wish to speak (posting an exclamation point) and when you were done speaking, it looked to me like it just wasn't being followed. it could be that just adhering to that system would speed things up."
"i am in favour of taking the task of maintaining order at csm meetings out of the hands of the csm to allow them to focus on issues while somebody else focusses on fairness in points of order.in most democracies this role is called a speaker."
"this or some other similar mechanism to facilitate meetings makes sense."
"that was never established. serenity took it upon himself to do that."
"this i like - it fits with ccp's demands regarding text meetings, and it will eliminate at least half of the chaos we've experienced thus far."
":: looks at your alliance ::as i've commented already on (yet!) another thread, the very first use of a \"!\" to ask to speak was by serenity in last night's meeting. there was no full-csm discussion nor statement from the chair at the commencement of the meeting about its use.in my experience, the use of a \"main - recorded\" channel and a \"sidebars - raising hand\" channel is the normal / best way to go, and i said this last night.iz"
"should it be established? i thought it was mutually agreed upon, my b."
"thank you for expressing support - mind showing your thumb?"
"ianna it's hardly fair to claim to represent all players and then start poking at people's corp tickers. clearly people speaking out of turn was a part of the problem, and there are ways of making your dissatisfaction with the proceedings known without jumping in - and although i in no way would lay all or most of the blame at your feet, reading over the chatlogs you often insert little parenthetical statements that clutter up the log and i can only imagine that makes it harder to follow what is going on when the conversation is happening in realtime. keeping a meeting orderly is a group effort and whatever criticisms you might have of the way it was chaired, you weren't contributing to that order either.going into the next meeting it would behoove you all to adhere to common parlimentary procedure and refrain from interjecting except to say \"i have something to say\" or \"!\" or whatever you want it to be. but the more people fail to follow some consistent process for speaking-order, the more you're all going to run into gavel-banging, \"you're out of order\" - \"no this court is out of order!\" situations."
"i'll second the efficiency of this method for chat-based agendas. it's worked great for our alliance meetings so far."
"currently position of chairman of the csm is given to the candidate who recieved the most votes in the csm electoral process. this seems fair on first sight, but might result in a chairman who lacks support with other csm candidates.i recommend a csm internal vote to appoint the chairman of this council, since the chairman is likely to be able to do her/his job best with support from the csm members themselves.in short:- public vote for the csm candidates (as is)- csm internal vote for their chairman (new)this process would make sense for the next csm elections."
"yea. speaker or chairman of parlament should be elected by parlament as he speaks for em..."
"this is a duplicate thread - the original has already received csm approval, and will be taken to iceland."
"ah, good to hear this has already been approved."
"hey sorry farrqua, missed that. i'm not sure what you mean by \"what stops\" 3 big alliances from attacking the same system. in the example system i linked (which i'll reiterate is not what the csm is taking to ccp, it's just there as an example) alliances lay claim to stargates in areas they frequent and when those claims are contested they have a certain amount of time to respond and re-assert their claim. if they don't return to re-assert the claim the stargate falls back to a neutral state.so to answer your question it more depends on the long term presence of these forces - a single encounter in a single system isn't going to swing things one way or another, it's more the cumulative effect of an alliance's presence in an area. nothing stops the scenario you're asking about from happening, but the long term effect is based on the presence of those alliances in the system over the long term."
"i.e. its ping pong.\"guys, the owners of the station just depend on the long term occupancy! its totally fine!\""
"well, shield-buffer hurricanes fail tragically under sentries, and tbh, no web makes them unable to use the 3 gyrostabs fully (meaning; toe to toe with high-damage ammos loaded). using ecm drones does sacrifice a notable amount of its dps anyway.besides, no hurricane setup you do won't kill a ham-gank drake up close (none of the bcs will, the harbringer being probably the most likely to do it or a really really well tanked rigged myrmidon with implants vs a not top skilled drake which could kill its drones anyway. you can do a 2xmar ii, 2x eanm ii, dc ii tank plus damage mod. losing drone dps hurts, but oh well.yeah - but on the other hand, you can't simply give it all it has now plus 5 ogre iis. it simply does too much dps - it used to enable the myrmidon (together with blasters, possibly supported by one magstab) to do metric tons of damage while still having a not so flimsy tank. killing drones yielded huge issues because you simply couldn't kill em fast enough before the dps literally melted you.also, don't use 5 hammer iis if you're looking for flat out dps - 2x ogre ii, 2x hammerhead ii and 1x hobgoblin ii is the mix you're looking for when you're interested in dps.it is. i can't wait to skill into t2 hams."
"comeone guys, there was a time when i could fly with myrm towards x bs protected mining op kill everything and possibly escape or pop. now i cannot match any other bc with similar amount of sp. yes i can tank, but i can tank not better than noob drake with 5mil sp pilot - drake can do it perma, i have max 10 800's.tell me how ur utilising your myrm?. in fleet tanking is useless, solo ? what for ?. rating - take a ishtar, drake, cerb even lousy deimos can do better not mentioning other races which i'm not very familiar with.i understand every race has to have useless ships, as it seems but tier 1 galente bs is much more versatile than tier t2. it has no niche. if i'm seeing myrm in hostile gang right now i'm pretty sure that its pilot took it to get insurance back or experimenting with some funny setup like ecm myrm or nano myrm, in both situations threat level from him is low and he will die last ;)"
"literally castrated?"
"i will not say the myrmidon is useless, it still tanks well, and can still put out good dps, but that isn't my issue, my issue is i put most of my sp into drones, i am and will always be a drone boat pilot, i can fly drakes, harbys, etc, but drones are my tool of choice, i would love to give up 3 turrets and 2 highslots on the myrmidon to get back the full 5 heavys, and a little more drone bay, it wouldnt do any more dmg then it does now, and would lose highslots so as not to offer utility slots like the domi, it is however the gallente bc size drone boat and needs to be put back where it belongs. /signed, though to the op can we be a bit less dramatic so people will take this more seriously"
"why is it impossible to appeal to a higher power about biased or unfair moderation on these forums. i have evidence that moderators have deleted supporting posts in the assembly hall forum without noting they have done so and without reason. when i asked about this at the email address given i was ignored completely (over a week without reply now despite a second resending of it in case it got 'lost').given the clear possibility for abuse by moderators on these forums and no one policing their behaviour (a complaint about them is sent straight to the people you are complaining about, a situation unacceptable in any scenario) it is clear that it is past due that these abuses are investigated by internal affairs (if this department even still exists)."
"this is never, ever, ever going to change, but it would be nice to have someone bring this up"
"agreed."
"its not impossible.as i understand complaints about moderation is sent to the community manager. he is not a mod, more like a moderator for the mods.and internal affairs still exist."
"in the past i have received replies from that address signed by the same person that performed the questionable moderation in the first place (ccp navigator)."

"the center of many, many ships is not at the center of the camera at all times. the model of many ships including the myrmidon, scorpion, raven, ... hell, all of them are off center (save for the pod).anyway, this is a simple issue that needs very simple fixing. simply set the point of origin on the object or the object axis to be in the center of the screen at all times.here is a screenshot of a sub-issue that i would like to address that ties into this to an extent.that is a myrmidon viewed close up. what are we centered on? the area where the thruster meets the ship. i believe ccp has made the model \"center\" the thrusters + ship and it is causing us much grief.a simple fix to the models should not prove a problem. when the new ships came out in revelations i remember having a huge issue on the test server with the myrmidon axis being all wonky, but come tq time they fixed it. now they've broken it all over again.please support this so we can have working directional scanners and a more attractive visual appearance in-game that does not have issues such as this detracting from game play functionality and aesthetics."

"edit: login cookie deleted contentbad plan. you'd have to search out wrecks then come back to them an hour later. not everyone plays eve for hours and hours on end. ninja salvagers are already disadvantaged by the fact that they can't tractor beam. the wreck maker can tractor beam. there are so many counters to ninja salvagers, from getting a gang salvager to aggerssion gaining strategem. giving in to the mission running carebears would reduce mission ruining to mindless farming even moreso than it already is. the game encourages player interaction. greed is on the mission runners side in the form of salvage evolving into loot stealing.the choice is how do i counter a salvager busting in on my mission - freedom of choices and result of that. this is a tactical choice, and this should be encouraged. for the most part, you don't actually fly your ship, you choose the equipment and skills to fit it - so tactical choices are very limited already."
"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks."

"after reading the logs from the latest csm meeting it seems like some of the council members are acting like immature children and muting and kicking each other from the channel where the meeting was held. what are these people doing on this council if they have to resort to kicking and muting in order to solve conflicts .you would expect these people to at least behave like adults and be able to talk to each other without kicking people .i guess ccp will have to continue to communicate with their customers using these forums instead since this csm thing obviously isn't working.you can't really blame ccp though. they didn't vote for the candidate(s) that obviously aren't up to the task of acting like adults.edit: link to the log in question:"

"csm members are still getting settled in so the first meetings are supposed to be pointless.the point is that if all these people meet in rl it will change for the better.if you ever attended long boring corporate meetings you'd know."
"this must be recorded when it happens. must i say."
"ccp is able to record serverside with vivox's eve voice. so that shouldn't be too hard.while i'm not a big fan of eve voice, it's much better than text-based. only issue i see is editing out secret information and quoting the meeting for future reference."
"jade constantine is roleplaying as if hes in front of congress.that will never, ever work. there is no \"have the floor\" in a chat room.heres what you guys do. heres yet another freebee that i really need to stop giving out but hay i'm used to being exploited \o/use a forum to separate the topics into their own threads.you post a complete thought without interruption.you don't all have to be logged in at the same time.and when it comes time to hold a \"meeting\", for god sake use voicechat."
"i really don't understand why the meetings have to be chat based. chats aren't suitable tools for communicating and discussing complex matters.why isn't there a internal forum for the csm. though forums are also used for trolling, they at at least sometimes come up with something productive, while i still have to witness something worthwhile being discussed in chats.also a forum would have numerous advantages. instead of having a set date on which all participants have to attend, you could set a time window for discussion and a deadline for votes."
"you cant effectively hold a 'meeting' with 7 people on a chat program.what else is new today?rain is wet? front of a train is stronger than your head?"
"they get free trips to iceland. we get some comedy and drama. voice chat would multiply the hilarity tenfold, but honestly i don't have five hours to listen in on a voice meeting between those clowns!"
"voice comm's anyone? (gratz to all the people who voted in jade; brilliant)"
"wait, i didnt check entire chat log, but i didnt see wall of text. this can only mean one thing. the jade in the chat is an imposter"
"i voted for you vista because of your post on the forum and what you wanted to do. you need to drag some stability in there. plus you have the balls to come here and post that is worth something too.ahh it feels good to yell at a rep. or we can just pod them over and over."
"use voice !!!"
"new teams go trough 5 stages during their lifecycle...as explained here"
"qfe from that log its seems like he/she is a condisending arogant **** :d(yes i know i spelled it wrong bite me)"
"it wont help, have you ever been in a voice chat meeting with jade? its about the same as him having op."
"normally i rail against all lvv posts, but this one is good. if you weren't such a carebear i might have voted for ya."
"sounds like par of the course for jade atleast someone is calling him out on his ******ed ****."
"wait, people are surprised that jade constantine is a giant, bleeding female reproductive organ?"
"yes they need to get a forum,, text chat isnt gonna work :\"
"so did they just not adopt a parliamentary procedure at all?"
"i'm pretty sure they did, trying to sort through the chatlogs, i'm pretty sure they basically have a parliment where the chair is a 12 year old kid who can stop anyone who disagrees with him from talkingoh well, we all knew that the csm were never actually going to be able to change anything, at least now we get a few laughs out of the whole debacle"
"self important tedious c**tsdid any of you really expect anything else?"
"they should simply vote an arbitrating member. democracy rules even if members are not keen on the arbitrator, the group as a whole voted for that one person.or if you want to get pragmatic, you could always vote 3 arbitrators that vote to move on or continue a pointless discussion.second, this really does sound like they simply need time to adjust and adapt to each other. but have a single strong headed person chairing the meetings will only disrupt enough for everyone else to walk out. the chair's role should really be that of a listener to ideas and interpret those into a group understanding, by pushing his or her own ideas is never going to work if people do not trust the chair. chair should be voted in, by other members not take senior role due to popularity contest.i have not read through all the chat logs or the ccp guidelines for running the meetings (i hope they have them!) but i am sure the mature members of the council can set these simple situations up. contemplating with a perpetuate kid trying to push he/her ideas will make the whole process a shambles and never move on from this 'stage'.but remember.... youre meant to be a voice for the players!!! your opinions should not be pushed if it is not represented by the eve population!"
"why can't i just read the pdf in tahoma or arial?copied it and moved it to notepad. :|"
"this frankly. i changed the font to arial and it went from 67 pages to 42"
"crap you people. i'm gonna write this in big letters so everyone can understand what the word \"abstain\" means.abstain means you are not voting.so, if you have 10 people and 4 vote yes, 3 vote no and 3 abstain, that is a pass vote because majority rules, and the vote is 4 yes to 3 no.read this again:4 people voted yes.3 people voted no.another example.10 voters vote on an issue. 3 vote yes, 1 votes no and 6 abstain. vote passes.3 voted yes.1 voted no.majority rules.that is what to abstain means.taken from wikipedia."
"lol what did you expect? just read these forums and all the kneejerk thread and replies and you will see that jade constatine is a great ambassador for this community. even wow has a more mature community than eve these days.sad thing is, people like hardin are trying to do a good job gets overshadowed by ****tards such as seen in that chatlog."
"i am realy disapointed with the csm. the meaning of \"mayority\" discussion was just ******ed. to have no doubts i ran across several constitutions and other legislation acts and it is as follows: \"mayority\" - more yes than no, \"absolut mayority\" 50% + 1 of pressent voiting yes, and a special order of voting requiering more than 50% but that is not important. the chat based discussion is highly inefective that is obvious. also i don't realy see any diffrent points of view because most of the topics are concluded that they will discuss it with ccp insted of putting forward sertain solutions. and i agree with the person that said that the forum way is much more efficent :dedit: forgot about the jade issue. jade delusions herself that she is a real politician and acts as if she realy was. muting others for typing too slow is stupid and immature. hope there is a procedure to change the chair before another election"
"i am just wondering if jade is gonna adress his actions. i mean as mentioned previously, the csm is meant to put forward eve's community thoughts and feeling, and not there own...on a side note, who the hell voted for jade anyway?!?!? i mean seriously ...."
"i'd much rather ccp spend the rl cash that will be wasted on this csm on monthly ****up's for themselves.rl cash that we pay thinking it might actually go towards making eve a better game.fat ****ing chance with the cash wasted here."
"is there an option for like a non-confidence vote? or is csm stuck with candidates it has?"
"if we compare csm with the playerbase i'd wonder who'd we call more immature and childish. and lets not forget whining, spoiled and obnoxious."
"hello chaps,a few comments:1) i would just like to point out one thing about the 'chat log' posted here.the chat log came from a member of the committee who had channel rights, which is why it contains a note about inanna being muted by jade.unfortunately, the other members of the committee, who do not have channel rights, did not see that notification and therefore had no idea that jade had gagged inanna and jade didn't inform us.i only became aware that inanna had been gagged when she mentioned it to me in a separate convo.2) i was not happy with how the meeting went yesterday particularly jade's 'editorialising', his muting of inanna and then raising two issues we had already discussed after we had completed the official agenda and have made some suggestions to the other csm members about how this should be handled in future.however all that said the csm committee did has passed a large number of issues on to our iceland discussions with ccp - mostly unanimously agreed. if we end up getting ccp to do something about even 50% of these then in my view csm will have done its job making eve better for everyone! yes there is bickering but it is to some extent the nature of the beast.3) a lot of the responsibility for csm wasting time in 'discussions' over 'majorities/alternates' etc is down to ccp who have only provided the initial csm with very vague operating principles. as a result this first csm in particular will be more painful as we work these teething 'issues' out. it is my hope that as the csm process develops that less time is spent upon csm procedure and more time on issues that impact the game positively but have to say that at least initially we will see these debates as a csm 'constitution' is developed. cheers"
"it's the community's fault for voting in people they've heard of, rather than looking for the best candidate. while jade, ankhesentapemkah and the like get in, really good candidates without forum reputations don't have a chance."
"cant say im surprised or bothered after all they only applied to the csm for the free holidays to iceland."
"i must say i was rather amused and disturbed by that chat log."
"use.a.forum.they are superior in every way.they,1) separate issues into threads2) can quote so you know wtf people are replying to3) can't be interrupted4) have infinitely superior time constraintsand in general they make everything easier for everyone. hardin, so you were a counselor irl.well, this isn't gonna work in a chat room. a chat room is the most unorganized cluster**** of a discussion meeting you could ever hope for.whether it be to show off or make use of your irl experience, or just to roleplay that you're in a courtroom doesn't matter. you're better off using a forum."
"how about you start next meeting with deciding how other csm meetings are going to work? like dont mute others, even if there is a good reason to mute them. next, this was first time, give them some time to get used to these kind of meetings. allthough i dont agree with jade muting arround, i can understand that you get touchy after chatting that long.and finally, they indeed look like a good representation of the eve user base.edit: i got second thoughts, jade shouldnt mute less, but should mute more often. well maybe not really mute them, but it is a chat based meeting now where everyone talks at the same time. no **** it becomes chaotic and you want to mute some. ever tried an msn conversation with 10 people? one should be talking at a time. and if you are going to do that via text chat, the meeting will take 12 hours next time. solution: use forum (you cant post in each others posts, so it stays clear) and once a week (or something like that) you talk directly with each other using voice chat."
"fourm (fo<U+FFFD>rum)1. the marketplace or public square of an ancient roman city, the center of judicial and business affairs and a place of assembly for the people.2. a court or tribunal: the forum of public opinion. 3. an assembly, meeting place, television program, etc., for the discussion of questions of public interest.i think people often forget about what the word \"forum\" actually means. a forum is a discussion place. a chatroom is where people get together to chatter away about whatever. organized discussions can take place in a forum, where there is less organization in a chatroom, which can lead to chaos.i agree here that a forum would be more appropriate, but it is sort of amusing to watch how they problem solve.sadly, i have a feeling that after reading the entire thing, some of them are in over their heads (which... sucks.) and, i did not say all, i said some."
"i was neutral and open minded about the csm, but after reading the chat log, first impressions were initially , then , then finally i hope things improve- i am sure some of the csms do also, they have donated a lot of their time to this."
"i have so far spent at least 8 hrs of my eve playing time in 'csm meetings' which i am sure as you can see from the chatlog is not necessarily the most 'fun' time to be had in eve on top of this there is the huge amount of time i have spent reading through the assembly forum issues (go take a look at the amount of threads in there) and deciding on the merits/demerits to each.of course i am not complaining about that - heck i enjoy the political stuff - but to state that we only did it for a free trip to iceland is a bit ridiculous when from what i can tell most of the csm candidates can well afford to pay for their own holidaysalthough i am not sure any of us would want to pay for a holiday which will involve us being locked up in a committee room with 8 other egotists for 4 days (especially as it means i actually use some of my 'proper' holiday allocation which could have been better spent on a beach somewhere personally i stood because i am passionate about this game and do want to see it improved and believe that the csm does have the potential to promote positive change to ccp. of course we will have to wait and see how it turns out"
"if the majority of csm members have issues with the current chairman you should probably post a petition to ccp of a vote of no confidence and request an anonymous election within the group for an figure head chairman (committee arbitrator) be actioned.you will probably want to get over 70% of your present members to agree before posting any vote of no confidence to highlight its not just one or two individuals that are not happy with current situationotherwise this op is just a lot of hot air, and its main point to post is to derail the good job the csm is/or could be doing.edit: nothing more pointless and rather dimwitted is to post meanings of words. well done for your great understanding, but please stop as you might be suprised people know said meaning. it only serves to show your ability to be willing to belittle people in trying to prove a point."
"i think the csm needs to recruit a speaker to handle this. let points of order be left to someone who isn't trying to put a case at the same time."
"while i think everyone, csm included, would agree that the discussion left a lot to be desired, i think it's a bit of a misnomer to claim that any 'kicking' has taken place in this instance.as evidenced by the chat log, for those who don't have the patience to read it all, jade constantine did indeed block inanna zule, in fact on three separate occasions:however, there is no record in the chatlog of inanna being kicked from the channel. we thus have two explanations for why inanna left the channel at some point between 21:36 and 21:47: that jade, or another player with moderator priveleges, removed them (which is the theory everyone seems to be assuming) or that inanna, by design or accident, left the channel on their own.there is evidence in the logs to suggest that the former is doubtful, other than jade's own protestations of innocence:getting over the indignation of some of the csm representatives at jade's actions for the moment, i think we're best served by following the advice of bane:so rather than stirring up any more accusations, it seems appropriate to let the devs look into the chat logs and see if any discretion on the part of jade has taken place. while i'm not intimate with csm procedure (as, apparently, no one is) if the chairman did indeed kick inanna from the channel, some sort of review should place to ensure that such powers cannot be abused in the future. on the other hand, if inanna left the channel through other means, and was merely muted so the vote could take place, the issue seems less severe.the concept of a chairman being able to terminate unwanted discussion at a whim runs counter to the principle of a democratically elected body, and i implore the csm to remove moderator privileges from all members of the quorum to ensure an incident such as this is not repeated.having said all that, the meeting seemed to run quite smoothly save for the debate over the role of abstaining. issues that were brought up on these forums were discussed, the merit of some suggestions was carefully reviewed, and the entire process was completely transparent to the regular observer. the csm should see these early disagreements and disputes as a learning experience, and move on. a great deal of player interest is vested within them."
"inanna wasn't kicked - she was muted. some bug did kick her out of the channel though when jade tried to unmute her!"
"oh my god that painted an epic picture in my head, framed in pure gold.you made my day joe starbreaker."
"anyone taking bets on who gets muted next? my money is on lvv with darius as a close second."
"what was the actual reason for muting?"
"::shakes head solemnly::from review of all the current logs posted, it appears that our newly elected body politic is not quite up to scratch on the points of parliamentary procedure.things appear to be rushed before all results are in. haste seems to be this (dis)organisation's pitfall... not to mention unattentiveness to the propsals put on the table for consideration, and therefore more time wasted on re-review of the matter that was clearly stated mere moments before.it's a bloody chat channel... missed something? ... scroll up.csm: you must exsercise patience, restraint, and above all profesionalism. i would advise that this esteemed group, as a whole refamiliarise themselves with simple parliamentary procedure, and conduct meetings accordingly... reguardless of how long it may take.... stay on task until the task is completed.** point of order **votes in abstentia only count on the recorded vote, wherein the majority (yea, or nae) is counted for official result (simple majority rule), or in the case of the proposed (full majority) yea, or nae votes numbering 5 or more would be required for a proposal to be carried... votes in abstentia do not count as nae votes, and are to be recorded as abstentia votes (neither yea, or nae; as the issue or proposal is unclear and warrants further investigation) for the official record.... what i've seen thus far, does not please me in the least."
"rofl who woulda thought of the choices jade would be the one stirring up ****."
"they were like a deer in headlights when it came to exploration in a large hull'd vessel.wtf is their problem? i can do every level 4 mission in a raven but god forbid i can do exploration without having to travel a million f'ing jumps to pick up my combat vessel and come back to finish the site.these people are gd biased idiots. if you've never done it as a profession then stfu and let the people that have make the vote."
"this is what you get for voting for jade tbh."
"laffing like a mother ****er"
"at first i was sad that the person i voted for didn't make it, after reading this i'm a bit mad."
"omg! i can't believe the transcript of this meeting! are they all really arguing over how to hold meetings and cast votes? this reads of stupid petty squabblings of people who perceive themselves to be more important than they really are! my god! is this the best that was taken from the eve community? for crying out loud sack these people!!!"
"lol @ csm."
"vote alteration, petty bureaucracy, abuse of power, hours of talking whilst saying nothing.\"not fit for purpose\" did sort of spring to mind..."
"darius is a champ :)"
"lol?"
"thank you, hardin. to be fair, i think your conduct in the entire chat log is commendable. hopefully that conduct is contagious, and the first iceland trip turns out well."
"jade constant-fail"
"what a massive pile of ****.most of the csm got less votes than the number of people who abstained. and so far all they've done is recreate the tossbank that is eve-o forums in miniature.great going. 50% price increase for eve-online. new csm. coincidence?"
"i expect this thread to be at 10 pages when i get home in two hours.get to it! chop-chop!"
"this is by far the most compelling statement made in that entire log."
"thats quite debatable and is in fact for the council to decide for themselves. i have seen and studied organizations that use both ways of thinking. some require 50%+1 of the delegates to say yes (i.e. abstentions count as a no) and some require 50%+1 of the votes cast (i.e. abstentions don't count either way)."
"/me facepalms! well - one thing is for certain. if ccp ever feared that the csm would constitute a unified front from the player base keeping them on their toes and making sure they stuck to their promises, then they need not worry at all now. how pathetic was that.......!?in its very first \"meeting' the csm has managed to erode its authority completely. will anyone bother to try to leverage the csm from now on, or will it simply be reduced to being a channel for major alliances to try to manipulate the development of eve for their own interests. whichever it is - csm as a concept has failed...."
"whereas i expect some new forum rule that didn't exist before this thread was created to be in effect by time you get home.especially since i have \"scented\" it already."
"this.also thank you for this log. it brightened up my day with bowelfuls of laughter. and my bowels always needed a good laugh."
"hop on board to the lol train, tickets are free. what a shame, the power-hungry individual holds rule. we're all screwed."
"disappointing to the point of despair."
"i've been stuck in what seemed like largely unproductive meetings all day and then i come out and read this.all i can say is, thank you csm"
"for some reason, this character's name is quite appropriate."
"motion to nominate the official background music for reading of the csm logs."
"lol thanks for this its like reading jita local"
"damn, thats one cluster****."
"this is how democracy works guys. people aren't muted in nth korea, their just shot and as a result things work just fine there.make love not warcraft."
"put nine elected, power-sharing politicians in an internet chat channel without even emoticons to help convey emotion and non-verbal queues and this is bound to happen. i'm not terribly surprised, to be honest, though i am amused. let's see if the csm can do better once they meet in person."
"this is crazy.good ol' csm members, if you're reading this, you may want to look at getting a neutral non-voting parliamentarian to run your meetings. the kind of bias in those logs is inexcusable for someone running that kind of meeting."
"i hope like hell that it's filmed. :)"
"next pod cast needs dramatic readings of these logs with sexy results"
"absolutely"
"and here i voted for goum in hopes he'd ruin the csm. i could have saved myself a lot of trouble and voted for jade had i known he was so capable of destroying the csm in such a short period of time.at any rate, after reading that epic failure of a meeting, i do hope ccp steps in and does something to correct the situation. clearly the csm isn't working under the current ruleset.ps i'll bet 5mil isk that jade either gets arrested or thrown out of ccp by security while the csm is on their trip"
"reminds me of the movie, \"12 angry men\""
"i can just imagine it..ccp newsflash...riot erupts after chairman tries to forcebly use ducktape are we sure jade isn't a 'closet' minmatar??"
"thanks for giving me a laugh, its like goonswarm, childrens in the council."
"ahahahahahagg"
"this tbh.i'm getting more and more happy by the day that i decided to pull out of the running for what is quickly becoming a circus and a farce."
"i hate to say i told you you so but.....i guess the the whole csm thing goes down as just one more of the epic failures of evemaybe once they meat in person with reps from ccp thows cool (no pun intended) non violent icelanders can defuse the situation with on the csm boardbesides is it any wonder they are like this the csm board is primarily made up of americans"
"putting my head above the pa****t again i would like to point out that in last week's meeting (and most of this week's meeting) a lot of useful business was done.a lot of issues - are going to be brought forward to iceland - most of them fairly unanimously supported. many of these changes are small tweaks which incrementally and collectively should make eve a better game for us all - even if ccp only acts on 50% of them.yes, the meeting last night did become ridiculous at points - which obviously isn't great - but there is still the potential for a lot of good to come out of csm so please don't judge it on the basis of these chatlogs but on the results that are delivered.if nothing changes - that will be the point we can slam the csm - until then just enjoy the 'entertainment'"
"and here i was thinking i was bad at running meetings, guess i'm not that bad after all...jade, you need to step down as chairman, you are very obviously not fit for the position. do it yourself and you might save some dignity..."
"i bet they will- people tend to behave more respectfully when face to face as opposed to via a keyboard."
"actually the largest national contingents are dutch (3) and english (3). we also have one dane and just two americans"
"with all due respect to yourself and to the others who are actually taking this seriously, it's deplorable how much time is wasted in these meetings for petty and ridiculous stuff. if you guys need clarifications on what you should be doing and how you should be doing it with regard to the constitutions you should talk to ccp directly and stop wasting time with this inconsequential excrement that has happened for the last three meetings.you should not be voting on or discussing how the csm should be run, you should be discussing and voting on issues that the community has brought to your attention. your current chairman is more interested in petty bureaucratic issues which at the end of it all have no bearing whatsoever with what you guys were elected to do.stop bringing up these issues with the csm during the meetings and if you must talk about them do it on your own time on the forums or in private and then bring them to ccp yourselves. you are not serving the community with this.you should be talking about internet spaceships so for the love of all that is holy, please do it."
"i totally agree - keep your eyes on the prize. i do think a voice chat might be preferable though, one would hope that would cut down on the distracting parenthetical asides."
"@halca, if you havent decided how exactly the voting is done it is pretty useless to vote. so it is normal to first decide about such things"
"this is a problem for ccp to clarify, not for them to decide arbitrarily in a meeting that is being misused for bureacratic silliness. they are there to represent us, not to play at politics."
"the problem wasnt that, the problem was that jade wasnt exactly ideal, but also that many other members had serious issues about knowing when to shut up. 8 people trying to speak at same time on eve in game chat just does not work."
"my problem is that every single argument to date has been about some petty bureucratic crap that has no bearing on any of the actual issues being raised. ironically when they discuss real issues they get voted on and resolved quickly. instead we're forced to suffer through pages of chatlogs about stuff nobody really cares about. if they are really struggling this much at understanding what they should be doing and how it should be done then maybe it's time for them to go talk to ccp for clarifications instead of wasting so much time on this piffle."
"well, i read the csm logs and would agree, they were fiasco-tastic. so, i thought a bit, and suggested this solution:"
"well the meeting was 75% fiasco, 25% useful. but ultimately good issues got onto the agenda including the council-voted csm chair. i'll be pushing that one in iceland and hopefully it gets added to the constitution. if it does i'll be stepping down from chair and seeing what the re-vote brings. the council will be able to vote for its own chair and i'll probably get to sit back and sip fine wine. but at least i'll have cat-herded some decent issues onto the agenda and made a progressive change to the constitution in the inaugural csm. anything else is pure froth at this point."
"unfortunately halca ccp did not give us specifics on how this would work. we are therefore having to develop a 'constitution' as we go along.therefore this first csm was always going to be a bit 'messy' until basic procedures are put in place. in theory subsequent csm's will then have a 'structure' to work from and can avoid some of the more pointless 'procedural' debates."
"pretty much, yeah. i find this rather surprising, actually - ccp can quote a dozen philosophers in their founding document for this group, but they can't toss in a one-liner about using xyz's rules of order. has nobody there ever been in on a meeting?"
"talk to ccp about it please, if this is the case then you are doomed to continued failure. you guys know you are wasting time with this, so do something about it. i seriously doubt ccp will refuse to help on this issue but if they do i'm sure you guys could raise some hell if it was brought to light.so far these meetings have been deplorable and they seem to be getting worse."
"i cannot believe we're expected to pay for you all to have a free holiday to iceland. it makes me sick that we're expected to pay t20's wages, but this as well, it's utterly pukeworthy, and hiding it some irrelevant csm forum won't make it go away either."
"halca, i have to disagree with you. there have been plenty of 'good results' out of the first few meetings in the shape of issues being brought forward to iceland - the majority pretty unanimously.yes the chatlogs are messy - and plain childish at points - but please look at the bigger picture. if csm can actually deliver ccp action on even 50% of the items we already have on the agenda i would consider the process to have been successful. of course that still needs to happen but hopefully once we move to the face to face part people will be more reasonable (well i hope so anyway)"
"do csm members have staff working for them? or will vista have to re-write that document on his own?"
"i didn't mean to say that the csm have done nothing hardin, merely that you could achieve substantially more without this level of bureacracy for the sake of bureaucracy. talk to ccp about the constitution and formalise the rules, get them to clarify it and you will have more time to deal with the issues instead of wasting your time on something they might not be happy with anyway and in my opinion is beyond your remit in the first place."
"i am sure he could ask for help, but otherwise he has to re-write it on his own. and all the csms have to do their \"write up\" on their own.then again, that \"write up\" seems to be \"linking to forum threads\""
"i have to agree that this has been a sore point with me the entire time. ccp should have defined these things. yesterday's meeting was the first time i can recall the concept of a \"constitution\" being thrown around and i can't say i'm for the idea at all. essentially i don't see a reason we couldn't all just sit down and discuss and vote on the issues without the need for all the stupid posturing and power grabbing.instead of a group of adults sitting in a room treating each other as thus we're left with petty squabbling over stupid e-powers that were never defined or even essentially necessary. i'd have assumed at some point ccp would step in and end the idiocy but perhaps they see some merit in the experiment. essentially everyone has their own ideas about what csm is and what their roles and responsibilities are. this is now most obvious in the chairmanship role. i see it (and the document seems to define it) as someone who schedules and facilitates the meetings and codifies the agenda. jade appears to view it as the person \"in charge\" of the csm, with signing, discussion moderating and vote defining authority. an executive if you will.i don't think anyone expected to have a \"boss\" in this and i don't think anyone signed on for that. i also don't think ccp intended such, as there's no way to make that work."
"well, the only \"power\" i believe the chair should have in these meetings is the ability to moderate discussion. what that actually means is the issue that causes such friction. last night we got into a ridiculous series of problems because nobody amongst the csm committee (thats all nine members) had the wit (myself included) to quote the piece from the founding document that specified simple majority voting was the default rule. instead we had had a 5/4 in the committee on the issue and i tried to get clarification with a vote - vote was resolved, some people felt they weren't bound by the vote. eventually husko pointed out the quote from the founding documentation and we had a re-vote that signified our (re)adoption of the simple majority voting system.now i lost patience with a csm member continually interrupting these votes with off-topic comments, critiques of spelling and grammar, and general disparagement on the real life knowledge of people debating with them.question is - what do you do as chair of a committee in a text-based chat when somebody will not, follow the procedures of discussion and voting and is continually interrupting? face to face its easy, you look them in the eye and ask them to behave and restate the principle that you raise your hand to be recognized. in a text chat in a badly overrunning meeting where we have the time pressure of knowing that anything we don't consider will not be on the formal iceland agenda and you have a recipe of bad-tempered exchanges and frustration for all concerned."
"it's not that i'm surprised that jade has managed to alienate so many people with pompous, self-serving and narcissistic behaviour that would shame a spoilt 12-year-old. i'm merely surprised that it has taken so long.three weeks for him to be revealed in his egotistical glory is far longer than i expected. who would have thought that somebody banned by ccp for disruptive behaviour on the forums would turn out to be a disastrous, self-centred and comedic failure as a chair?"
"again you attempt to rewrite history when the logs clearly show otherwise. nobody continuously interrupted votes... how delusional are you that you're making this statement not 7 posts after the actual conversation is quoted? face to face you won't have a mute button. if you think you're going to railroad your agenda there as well i can assure you, you will find it significantly less easy."
"i wish!yes, we get to spend three days at the offices of ccp and spend another day flying there and flying home again. in that trip are three weekdays - usually working days for most people - as well as a weekend. thus \"free\" is misleading. there are three days to be taken as holiday from work (aka losing three days holiday when we normally would have planned to take it) and there will be numerous small expenses related to our trip which won't be recoverable (i am told that beer / alcohol generally is way more expensive in iceland, for a start!). overall, we are going there to *work* and will each incur unavoidable / unrecoverable expenses; this isn't a playtime at fanfest ...izps. re the thread title: \"members\" didn't kick and mute each other ... not plural ... singular."
"the logs show otherwise. read them."
"quoting an \"i know you are but what am i\" post. spoken like a true child. (i didn't expect you to reason your way out of it because you're wrong.)"
"that a chair can be neutral and unbiased during a meeting, and assist the parties present through the discussions (and remove themselves from the chair temporarily if they wish to say something about the subject under discussion) is not a difficult thing to achieve. i've done it and i'm sure other members of the csm have, just as i'm certain many forum readers / eve pilots generally have. it shouldn't be the case that we need some referee in there alongside the chair.in the elections i was the ninth person to be seated in the council, but the rules say we are all equal once we are serving on the csm. that appears to be regularly forgotten by some (hence my reminding them) and though i didn't get overwhelming support i *was* elected and thus i serve *all* pilots throughout eve, not just those who voted for me. i am not answerable to my corp or alliance (indeed you may have noted disagreements i've had with my corp's leader on the forums!) and don't have to 'politik' my statements or decisions other than to do what i believe is in the best interests of *all* pilots. i would like to believe that last night's meeting was an aberration and we will move on positively in future.izps. two of nine isn't \"primarily\" sfaiaa ..."
"hey jade could you just copy/paste in the chatlogs that show the disruptive influence that forced you to mute a csmtia"
"how about you reason your way out of it? how about you get the logs which have been quoted here and in other places for your convenience and make an argument as to why this member was being disruptive?because the way i see it is the opposite. that when things didn't go your way you had a hissy fit and attempted to change the outcome in various ways. the first time you redefined the outcome of a vote that didn't go your way, the second time you badgered two csms to change their vote in a vote that they had already voted in!"
"inanna, do you speak for all csm's as being comfortable to raising objections after what has transpired?"
"at all times i speak for myself; i could not say what others may or may not believe. when i speak for myself i try to best represent the interests of all eve players and not my personal belief or play style.i will, however, continue to query whomever is in the chair if they make a statement contrary to the agreed position or fail to explain themselves or their actions. that is the duty of any member of any committee or council and despite the bullying / ongoing threats i will not change that. if pilots do not feel i did a good job then they can choose to not support me at the next elections; if they believe i did right then they can vote for me. it is called democracy and, in my opinion, is better than autocracy.i think there is a quote something like \"here i was elected, here i stand and fight for them all\".iz"
"sorry, but that single sentence is one of the most stupid things i've ever seen posted on these fourms.what the hell is the point in a discussion if one person can ultimately decide what is discussed, and silence anyone with whom they don't agree?it's unfortunate that the csm has turned out like this, and that there's so much bad feeling in the air about it. actually, it borders on being dissapointing to be honest."
"what is it with the damned hippy-flower-child-politically-correct mumbo jumbo being spoken on these forums today? we have an agenda, rep starts bringing up a topic not on the agenda = chair (moderation) \"thats not on the agenda, please disregard that topic.\" we have a topic, rep starts talking about a different topic = chair (moderation) \"thats not the topic please return to the topic.\" we have a vote, rep starts debating other people's voting choices = chair (moderation) \"please refrain from interfering with the process of the vote\" etc etc etc. moderation of a meeting does not mean censorship. it means that you are doing what you can to ensure the agenda items get raised, introduced, everyone who has a desire to speak on it gets to speak and say their piece, and then a vote happens, results are recorded. without some kind of moderation what is to stop the meeting simply arguing about the first agenda item for 2 hours and getting nowhere? 99% of the bad feeling comes from people who for one reason or other have decided they want the csm to fail. don't be one of them verone."
"restating votes in terms other than the ones which were actually voted on then muting people for calling you on it is censorship. the things you're referring to don't appear to be in the logs."
"oh man that chat log is gold... keep up the \"good\" work people i need more lulz jade constantine we really need a what a dong emote."
"quoting for posterity. keep digging yourself deeper. the most frustrating part of this all is your inability to accept responsibility for your actions. you don't even seem to realise why what you did was wrong. now you're just going to brush off the community's outrage by saying we \"just want the csm to fail\".**** you. if the csm doesn't remove you from chair its a failure that should be put on all of them."
"99% of the bad feeling comes from people who for one reason or other have decided they want the csm to fail. don't be one of them verone.wow."
"one word. narcissism."
"i can blame ccp they thought up the crappy thing, anyway you csm guys you act like a bunch of kids. i hope ccp dont pull it or scrap it tho, becuase if all the csm meetings are gonna be as imature as that one, you will feed me with lol's for a long time to come. shows we elected a bunch of morons mostly. next vote i wont bother."
"lol, don't make me laugh. a few dozen goon forum trolls and assorted hangers on is not \"the community.\" seriously, get over yourselves guys."
"are you familiar with the term \"irony\"?in before goon conspiracy, ohwait."
"there is more \"support\" for this issue than there is for any of the issues you personally pushed onto the agenda under the guise of \"community support\""
"1) adhere to the voting rules ccp stated. stop trying to make new rules. 2) inanna zuni stop interupting.3) darius johnson stop being an instigating ****er. you are so transparent its not even funny.4) jade, copy and paste is the true way to paraphrase, ie don't paraphrase, when you have a bunch of people who vote on something.5) i can't believe the amarr roleplayer and the super bears are the most professional lot in that chatlog."
"you were a bit too slow. seriously though, i'm thinking of have a siggy made that says \"i muted a csm rep and 2000 goons flamed me\" - now that'll be funny."
"yep, you're right."
"has he come out somewhere and said he was paraphrasing? i asked him what he was doing and he is ignoring me."
"you keep telling yourself it's only goons. just like you told yourself you had won some vote for moderation capability. just like you told yourself that inanna was being disruptive. just like you told yourself that the chat logs show anything other than you being a tit.i think you're on meds."
"in a few days time you can see for yourself. something tells me you'll be a lot more polite in person. time will tell."
"there's plenty of non-goons criticizing your immaturity and unprofessionalism, along with fellow csm reps."
"i think you've got the wrong guy. also, how would i be able to see for myself if you're on meds? would i rifle through your purse? i'm an ******* not a creep."
"jade tried to paraphrase the first vote on the alternate member. it didn't seem self-motivated and there is a clear understanding that there are logs to make sure he doesn't twist and turn votes into something other than what they where.but moderators don't need to do that. they do get a mute button in meetings. they can pull the room aside to make sure they are on track. there was nothing malicious about what jade did in that log. there is something darius johnson did and that was try to undermine jade's postition at every opportunity he could. its pathetic. everything he said boiled down to, \"who the hell do you think you are?\"the funny thing is people are complaining about the time in that log. they want to get it done. jade muted someone who kept dragging it off topic late into the meeting. bane even wanted it to be over. a goon. jade decides to put the majority of the members ahead of one and gave a warning. that is what i saw.this is turning out to be a really poor soap. jade stated he already wanted to step down as csm chair well before the incident. what else do you want from the guy seriously. its nothing but a big target unless a goon with a forum brigade gets the position and keeps the threads rolling in their favor by volumes of worthless circle jerking threads.might as well just shut down the csm and let ccp write it off as a lost cause."
"in my eyes, given the amount of putrid adolescent slush that's poured out of the mouths of the very people who should be running the csm, it's already failed.as for your other points, i'm not saying that a meeting shouldn't be chaired. i'm questioning what the hell the point is in a meeting when people who're taking part can't put their viewpoints across because they're silenced by an overzealous channel moderator."
"he might not be, but i'm looking forward to you trying to \"mute\" people when your in iceland. it's a lot harder without the button"
"what are the icelandic laws if a public brawl or fight takes place? what is ccp's stance on it? cause, judging by the way the forums have exploded and judging by how people are reacting, there might be a fight. people could be more polite in person. or not."
"ccp could always claim it is a sporting event, sumo wrestling."
"um... nowhere is it stated any member of the csm should be muting anyone. least of all for having an opinion. my statement of \"who the hell are you?\" stands. the chair is a meeting planner. nothing more. it's not undermining if the actual authority doesn't exist. it doesn't. nobody in my opinion dragged anyone off topic with the exception of jade. repeatedly. i don't seem to be the only person of this opinion so i feel i still have some handle on my sanity.also... you mention jade stating he wants to step down repeatedly... i've said repeatedly that he is well within his rights to do so. nothing's stopping him whatsoever."
"begs the question \"why did jade do that\". its quite clear that jade editorialized, not once, but twice, the vote that hardin put forward. then, when someone questioned said editorializing, jade got indignant that they were \"disrupting the meeting\". bull****, the editorializing was disrupting the meeting.objections are only disruptive when they are frivolous. was it? certainly not. if its not(and it wasn't), then the disruption is caused by the person doing whatever was objectionable.in both instances, the first when jade editorialized a vote that had gone against her way and the second when jade badgered two people who voted in a manner that did not suit her needs to change their vote on an issue she wanted passed it was jade who was doing the disrupting. then why hasn't jade done so, the csm document provides provisions for said step down and jade had read the csm document at the time of making said claim.it seems, that when someone makes a claim in full knowledge of what that claim means, then they don't follow through on that claim when the time comes to do so they were lying about their original intent."
"i stand by that moderation decision 100%. i don't care if 10,000 goons get up on their hind legs and cry primal soliloquies to the moon about this. if a disruptive csm member is preventing us getting the business of the meeting done then i believe the chair has the right to temp mute them to get the business of the vote underway. this wasn't about stopping discussion - the person in question had their say (many times) and their objections were noted - but the group wanted to move to the vote and get it done. sorry if it chaffs your sense of political correctness verone, but i believe getting through the agenda items and properly representing the player base that voted for us is more important than listening to pointless circular arguments that have already been stated in the course of the meeting."
"lol. and she just keeps going. like the duracell bunny but... less professional. what i like the most: writing it off as a goon campaign when clearly several members of the council have raised their concerns about her behaviour and so have a lot of other (non-goons) people. how can one be that delusional? yes, jade constantine, you actually ****ed a whole lot of people off. and it will come and bite you. lets see how your self importance goes once you've lost your e-powers."
"i heard iceland has the oldest democratic parliament of the world, they probably have a rich history of vikings chopping off eachothers' heads in heated debates. the next meeting in iceland will be recorded right? i mean, that's very important. csm should be transparent and all that."
"further irony. in the same post you can insinuate only goons are complaining, while \"addressing\" verone's (who is most certainly not a goon) concerns which mirror those of everyone else.this is called \"psychosis\", disconnection from reality."
"to clarify this point with something that was said in another thread which i had to correct: here is the vote in question and context to the post."
"oh man that's a great quote."
"i'm 100% standing by my decision to moderate when someone points out something i have done incorrectly and later admit to. right?"
"none of the concerns brought up have convinced me that there was anything incorrect about the moderation decision. i stand by it 100%. if ccp think i was wrong they can sack me, if the csm think i was wrong they can support my motion to make the chair an elected position and then vote for somebody else. at this point thats all anybody can substantively say on issue. we can have another 1000 goon posts complaining about muting and pretending to care about the process of the csm but it will make precisely no difference.i made a call, i stick by it. move on or keep crying. either way the agenda is going forward and we'll see what happens in iceland."
"csm with jade:[ 2008.06.08 22:02:28 ] lavista vista > this is a waste of everybody's time"
"i love the way people voted for hardin's proposition that allows csm members who are late to a meeting come in after the current agenda item is over.and then jade's idea of paraphrasing"
"i chuckle at the thought that anyone would even consider me to be concerned about political correctness.back to the point in question, i still fail to see where you even remotely used a sense of rational judgement when \"moderating\" the meeting in question. moreover, it seems to me that this is the first instance of a csm member using their position to force their voice to be heard over another equally important voice.when i withdrew from the csm applicants list, i mused on how long it would be before this kind of thing would occur, sadly i had more faith than i should have and it was misplaced due to the fact a mere matter of weeks into the first council's office, it's already happening.on a serious note, i'm concerned jade, extremely concerned. if you're the elected person who's chosen to represent my voice, and that of the the rest of the community in an office with ccp, in a sensible, well presented and mature way, then how do you think it makes myself and thousands of others feel to see you throwing your toys out of the playpen, and throwing your weight about when you can't get your own way?and all this, just a couple of weeks into a six month term.i'm concerned jade, and as someone who you were elected to represent, i have to ask; you were elected in by the majority vote because people had faith in you to act in a becoming manner of someone given the position of csm chairman. how do you intend on repairing the apparently massive damage that's been done to the working relationship between csm members because of your hasty and overzealous silencing of people who aren't saying what you want to hear?please don't take this post as bigotry, because trolling you, i am not.i'm genuinely concerned where the already visible divide between members of the csm will lead."
"what about another 1000 posts from non-goons? i'm a mission running rping carebear who lives in high sec where i can stare at my shiny toys with impunity, and i think you were out of line, reactionary and completely delusional in your \"enforcement\" of your imaginary powers. i'm shocked and a little dismayed to see that the two goon representatives on the council are outclassing you in spades."
"why not? there are two sides to an argument. \"nuh uh\" is not one of them. no, they cannot. there is no provision for that in the csm document, did you even read the thing?no, they cannot. did you even read the csm document? the csm brings the issues to ccp. ccp responds. there is no ability to change the csm document granted to the csm.the only way that the chair can be an elected position as current is for you to step down as you promised you would as allowed by the csm document when you were running where the council would then elect a new chairman. why don't you honor your promise? why instead do you choose to redefine the debate to suit your needs. there is no fox news on these forums to parrot your reality jade. all we have is the facts, and they disagree with you."
"resolutions:- darius has an axe to grind, put it away. read up on what chairmanship means.- jade will restrain the desire to mute as it is far more damaging than useful.- everyone there will behave differently next time. their underwear, like anyone's, are better unrevealed.as i read the logs i was amazed at the utter deluge of interruptions from half the csm. i have chaired many similar text chat meetings and the only way it works is to shut up until it is your turn to speak. everyone will (should) have a turn with the floor, usually granted in the order of requests placed. the job of the chair is to signal when the next person has the floor. when a person is finished speaking (has the floor), they signal to the chair that they relinquish the floor. nobody else speaks in that interval, including the chair. when that process fails, the person disrupting must be handled or the meeting falls apart quickly.there was only one person following this protocol, and she gained the attention of the chair with an !. cheers to the one person doing it right :)i'll bet all my isk the next meeting is more civil, on all sides."
"well jacque ... this is the motion from the agenda: i wanted to be sure on precisely what we were agreeing too. as you will note from the chatlog - anytime people questioned my paraphrasing i invited them to restate themselves for the record."
"ccp can indeed remove council members."
"no damage has been done. this is all forum froth and trolling. in reality we'll sit down next week and whenever and continue our job. you are welcome to your opinion that this was \"hasty and overzealous\" muting. i (and incidentally the v chair) am of the opinion it was entirely correct muting of a person who had fallen into a pattern of disruptive behaviour in the meeting. i have no opinions about what people say in meetings. its the when i'm concerned about. as long as they follow the proper order of debate, they respect other recognized speakers and they curtail their interruptions when asked there will be no further problems."
"this is a lie. again. the first time you stated it wrong you were corrected. the second time you re-stated it incorrectly after the vote had occured and when inanna objected you officially warned herhere is the freaking chat log copied and pasted into this window for you to see, again, from the original point of you mis-representing to the vote to the point of you warning inanna<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:30:27 ] jade constantine > 1st is issue is = can a candidate walk back in a meeting in process that has empowered an alternate and immediately dislodges the alternate and regains his position?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:30:40 ] hardin > great phrasing their jade<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:30:43 ] darius johnson > that's a misleading way of framing it<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:30:47 ] inanna zuni > issue of proxies is not on the table<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:30:51 ] jade constantine > rephrase it please hardin<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:30:59 ] jade constantine > and we'll vote on your phrasing<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:02 ] jade constantine > go<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:11 ] inanna zuni > yes, biased statement there by chair ..<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:29 ] hardin > 1st issue is can the elected candidate return to a meeting and regain voting rights when the debate moves on to the next item on the agenda<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:46 ] serenity steele > i vote no.<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:49 ] bane glorious > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:51 ] jade constantine > i vote no<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:52 ] ankhesentapemkah > nay.<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:56 ] hardin > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:31:57 ] darius johnson > yes<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:32:02 ] inanna zuni > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:32:05 ] dierdra vaal > vote against (at least until the issue of alternate terms has been solved)<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:32:07 ] lavista vista > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:32:16 ] jade constantine > okay its carried<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:32:30 ] hardin > thank you<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:05 ] jade constantine > alternates can be removed from csm rep voting status at any time by a candidate arriving at the meeting<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:08 ] jade constantine > next part<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:15 ] ankhesentapemkah > nay<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:16 ] inanna zuni > jade!<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:22 ] inanna zuni > please do not editorialize a decision<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:27 ] jade constantine > please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin ?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:29 ] hardin > 2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reason<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:42 ] jade constantine > @ inanna please stop interrupting<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:56 ] inanna zuni > jade ... please chair \"neutrally\" then<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:34:26 ] jade constantine > i'm going to ask you formally now inanna ... please stop interrupting the process of the vote<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:34:33 ] bane glorious > inanna has a point<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:34:48 ] bane glorious > if you want everyone else to play by the rules, you should tooand here is the original proposal in context that was motioned to be voted on before your first attempt to change the proposal<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:11:24 ] hardin > okay<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:11:27 ] hardin > i propose<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:11:42 ] serenity steele > /emote suggests take it in 2 parts if it's easier<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:11:55 ] lavista vista > /emote agrees<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:12:01 ] hardin > that once one of the duly elected csm candidates returns to a meeting he resumes his voting rights on the next item of the agendanow stop lying."
"really? i couldn't find it in the document? where is it?"
"i'm sure you'd like it if that were the case. i'm honestly ****ed and not too impressed with you this afternoon. nor was i yesterday. i don't imagine that will change this week unless you ask your future self to go back in time and prevent past you from muting a council member with no cause. by my math 2 isn't much of a plurality."
"look for eula violations as a key word. i'll find it if you can't. i can't get at the doc right this second."
"lol darius come on. you loathed me from before we both got elected. i said no damage is done. not that we're best chums. we disliked each other before the csm elections, we dislike each other now, nothings changed but that doesn't mean we can't look at issues about internet spaceships and cast votes."
"discussing spaceships and casting votes i'm all for. unfortunately someone went ape**** yesterday making that difficult. stick to the agenda and don't try to silence or \"bully\" people and we'll all be happy birds."
"so, let me get this straight :you're pretty much saying that although the vast majority of people who've posted, and whom you chair a body to represent, completely disagree with your treatment of csm members and are up in arms about it, you see nothing wrong with it and as such you did the correct thing?furthermore, you're stating that you'll continue to do the same thing if you feel that someone is getting in the way of what you have to say, and that you have no problem silencing members of the csm for no other reason than to be able to talk over them.you have blinders on to the world jade, and there's something seriously wrong with the csm and it's goals if you feel that this should be your role."
"as i haven't got an answer from jade on this point, despite myself and others asking repeatedly, maybe you can point to when and where i \"kept dragging it off topic\"? as i really can't. iz"
"oh god you guys are so immature it's ridiculous. the transcription and this thread makes the majority of you guys look like idiots (yes both you jade constantine and darius johnson with your witty crew of hurf blurf goon followers). it's pretty obvious you guys can't be impartial about all this for whatever your personal reasons, so either get ccp to make you a solid constitution with appropriate bylaws, quit the csm, or snap the **** up and leave your baggage at the door during the discussions.the best part of the csm will be the inevitable youtube video of the future fist fight between jade and darius."
"i am sorry, i was excluding the \"eligibility\" segment, since jades post was clearly indicating that they had the power to remove csms at their digression rather than if they violated a pre-existing agreement which precluded their involvement in the game.though it should be noted that both the documents do not actually provide a manner in which ccp can remove a csm, only when a player may not run. technically, since a csm is no longer running after they have been elected there is no way for ccp to remove them, though i doubt they would care with an eula violation."
"yep since the \"vast majority\" of posters here are goons with an agenda to promote and are enjoying the simple joy of trolling. and since this \"vast majority\" = a few dozen individual posters at best its easy to ignore, especially since the motivation of these posters is ridiculously transparent.nope thats absolutely not what i said and you know it. poor play verone, very poor."
"i'll look everything over later. i could have sworn there was some line in there regarding ccp being able to remove people."
"i thought so too, but i went and checked and didn't find it. v0vi could have missed it though"
"and that is the very point i was making when i asked you to stop editorialising. the original motion was a *positive* .. elected reps taking their rightful place .. whereas you were redefining it as a *negative* .. alternates get dumped. whilst i am very happy that (some) alternates are in the meeting channel and can step in as required it is the *elected* members who are here to serve the podpilot population for their six-month term, your 'reworking' made out that the elected members mattered less than the 'oh so close but no tomato' ones, and i saw that as very wrong.iz"
"no, that is what you said and you know it. you know it because we have quoted you, in this thread, doing what you did. and you are quoted here in this thread saying you would do the same thing.so either the record is wrong. and its not, its copy pasted from the logs and formatted officially by the secretary. you were lying when you said that you would do it again. or you were not lying when you said you would do it again and verone's interpretation is correct. neither outcome is very flattering for you."
"just because goons post on the forum, it doesn't make it false.also, i think the reaction i have had from people who contacted me out of the blue on messenger, says it all. jade, saying something is false doesn't make it true. people have documented your behaviour trough logs. you have only stated that people are wrong."
"whist i personally think jade was incorrect for a number of reason to mute you i would like to take this particular opportunity to ask you to leave that area well alone. if the goons or any other alliance/corp represented on the csm decided to war dec star fraction for a slight on the csm i would expect most of the allaince would do two things. first laugh at people not being able to keep out of game activites out of game and secondly cheers for a free war. and whilst you may wish to quote a certain 80's tv show in regards to your opinion on this subject it is quite clear what you are implying by bringing it up. furtheremore i personally feel that the ones at fault is mostly ccp for not providing the csm will more structure before deploying it as i think most of the arguements, diagrements and time wasting of the last couple of weeks can clearly be placed at thier door for the lack of support in creating this council in regards to the procedural side of the csm. if there had have been more of it in place the csm could have got on with representing the people who voted for them straight out the gate rather than it having to spend all this time bickering about simple matter of internal policy. maybe if we quote star fraction members that think jade was wrong on a \"number\" of things he'll listen.that is hearthstone here"
"after reading the chatlog i must say that the incident was unlucky and maybe jade was a bit too hasty with the mute, but seriously the way some people smack on jade is just childish and ridiculous."
"aside from the other odd chatting etc that went on gotta say i agree with the following. sry couldn't help but to notice this one..hardin > arriving 5 mins late for a meeting shouldnt exclude the democratically elected candidate from not participatinggotta say i agree with that one post right there. why the hell would i want an alternate to vote instead of someone who was voted in just cause the guy was 5 minutes late ? mid vote on topic 1 per say, hardin arrives but doesn't know what's up ? sure let the alternate vote on that one topic. on to next topic alternate leaves hardin (in the example) would take over."
"that was precisely how the majority of the council felt about it."
"now you're putting words in my mouth.whe you run out of arguments jade, it boils down to one thing. apparently i have an issue with you, or goonfleet have an issue with you, or someone else who disagrees has an issue with you, and doesn't like you and therefore is trying to troll you.that's not the case in this instance. i still regard you as one of the most respected players in the game, hence the position you've been put in by the playerbase.if i was trying to troll you, cause you problems or be a pain for you, trust me, you'd know about it and these words would be a lot harsher.i'm genuinely concerned, because i don't feel that as a chairman, you should be silencing any member of the csm who wants to speak and has the right to do so."
"verone, myself and you haven't often seen eye to eye in the past, on a whole multitude of issues.what i will say here though, is that what you have posted in this thread, is 100% spot on, and has been echoed in various channels i sit in.i haven't been an avid supporter of the whole csm thing from the start, because it was pretty evident that this is the way it would go. i can't say i'm glad to see myself proven right though.jade, just because somebody disagrees with you, does not mean that they have an issue with you, or they are trying to troll you."
"fixed that quote for ya."
"believe me, i'm so glad my opinion changed and i decided to withdraw."
"<--not a goon and i completely agree with verone and by chance-some goons.add the power crazed behavior, obvious attempts at manipulation and spin in re-phrasing resolutions for dramatic effect, and top it off with the over zealous support of a star fraction specific agenda and you have a total disaster in the chairman role. hard to imagine a worse combination of immaturity, egomania and a total committment to a self serving agenda all bottled up into person sitting in the chairman seat.a terrible shame for what could have been a decent social experiement in eve."
"i feel sorry for jade. lost his time, his gf and now his virtual reputation (if he ever had one)maybe he should resign and let csm try to recover."
"whether or not they had the right to do so is the question. it depends on whether there are rules of order or whether any csm rep can shout whatever they want wheneve they want.if the chair's job is to lead the meeting and ensure it adheres to rules of order, then it surely is the chair's job to call for silence when participants are out of order.the question is whether there are rules of order - either implicitly or explicitly - that the participants are supposed to be abiding by.serenity steele may have been using a method of requesting the floor of his own devising, but all the council members should be behaving with that sort of decorum, otherwise we have the parentheticals and exclamations that get in the way of an orderly discussion where everyone has a turn to say their peace.i don't think the intention is for the csm chamber to be a place where people shout over each other. and in the end that means someone has to be able to enforce order if the members cannot contain themselves to orderly conduct."
"if ccp wanted that they should have specified such and put a democratic process in place to choose the group's chair. \"most votes overall\" is a poor way to determine this.another alternative would have been for them to appoint someone to chair the meetings. my main problem with the process so far hasn't been order. it's been the lack of guidance from ccp and the usurping of \"power\" by people not responsible for doing so.if you look to the meeting prior to yesterday you'll see that as long as we stick to spaceships and away from power grabs, we are quite capable of carrying on a dialogue without the need for a daddy."
"isn't this the social experiment going pretty well as expected?there is no reason the csm can't still obtain success in their original goal as long as everyone can take a step back, calm down, and get back to the task at hand. anyone with real life board experience knows that people make mistakes, can't shut up, talk out of turn, get their nose out-of joint, get worked up, etc., at meetings. it doesn't mean you ask for resignations or give up on the process. you just just take a breath, prepare your material as best you can, and go into the next meeting trying to be as progressive and productive as possible.there are a lot of good points made in these threads (and this is not a stfu post), but let's give them a chance to sort things out on their own. blatent optimism, i know, but if i didn't have some faith in people i'd have quit this game long ago."
"good heavens could you be more dramatic! do you think my dog and goldfish are going to die next! listen to yourself. i volunteered to an elected position on a bloody player council in a mmorpg. i muted somebody in a meeting to let a vote get counted. now my \"virtual reputation\" (whatever that is) \"lies in tatters\" i've \"lost my time\" (sounds like a doctor who plot) and i've lost my gf? though how you'd know anything about my personal life i've got no clue. go outdoors! smell the fresh air! get a sense of perspective and have a beer!go find a girlfriend and have some fun mate. *shakes his head* kids today honestly."
"actually i am quite surprised to see the meeting progress when no in game politics are involved. so when they are talking space ships you get to actually see objective game mechanic discussions at play (for the most part)but when the power play comes in and e-peen muscles are being flexed, that is when we see the crap. i am sorry but there should be no reason to silence any one with in the context of that last meeting. it was a bit over the top and unnecessary. if jade would have just listened more to the group and less to hear himself talk, you would have had a very short and productive meeting. a sign of a good leader is someone who listens more than he/she speaks. and leads more than he/she dictates."
"somehow i doubt if my comments in that meeting would add up to a substantial proportion of the 4hour running time. but continue with the silly troll-war. its all getting a bit desperate. maybe my parrot dies next right?"
"hell yes to this. cheers to you all for sticking it out and getting issues on the table with ccp, as that's the most important thing.that said, ccp did appoint a chair - the person with the most votes. and they charged that chairperson with leading the meetings. implicit in leading meetings is keeping some semblance of order and moving the discussion and agenda forward. while you suggest that the chair has no powers, the only documentation of how the csm is supposed to run says the chairperson runs the meetings.it would have been nice if ccp had written detailed instructions, but they didn't. it's up to you guys to work together to keep things moving and the only instruction given is that jade's supposed to lead that effort. i think it's fair to argue with the exact nature of how he's supposed to do that, but to claim ccp's intention was that he have no authority on which to lead meetings is false, as it does say in the csm document that that is his job as chairperson."
"the guy who yells fire in a crowded theater doesn't do much running either, but that doesn't mean the commotion and delays caused were someone else's fault."
"looking at the mirror jade?"
"further irony, jade criticizing fellow eve players for being 'nerdy' despite his own lesbian-love-affair-roleplaying."
"sir, i am not a troll nor i am trolling. nor did i make any comments about any of your supposed real life issues, nor do i care. i am much as apart of this process as you or any one else. i am apart of the friggin player base. i am voicing my concerns and views based on what i am seeing and experiencing both here and in the damn game. you can not silence me like when you mash the mute button on your fellow csm members. your actions speak louder than your self delusional rants. you created this mess and now you are trying to push it off to others including the player base that happen to have voted for you."
"as soon as i saw your corporate ticker i chose to disregard your post, knowing full well what it's content would be."
"well, i'm sorry to ask. but isn't that a bit narrow-minded, when you are criticizing somebody?"
"it's exactly what jade does so v0v"
"well if you are going to quote my dear chap learn to read things before you quote k? first it's heartstone not hearthstone and i said he was wrong to mute her for a number of reasons not wrong on a number of things. as to the issue of wether the chair/v.chair should have the power to mute i think it is frankly pretty obvious he should indeed have this power as asking someone to be quiet and let the agenda continue without some way of making them (eventually). having it otherwise would be akin to someone standing on top of a hill 5 miles away from a music festival shouting \"would you chaps there mind keeping it down?\"in any case with the quite obvious axes to grind around here i shan't expect my words to have any affect really. have fun damning someone who has put an insane amount of work and effort into this for not doing it the way you like *shrug*"
"well, that's a yp not an mp."
"given past experience all i've seen when i've disagreed with jade is members under his roster blindly agreeing with him regardless of the subject when things get heated.so to answer your question, no. i don't feel it's narrow minded at all given the situation."
"would u guys all shut up and shake hands. you've ben elected by the community to represent us... not **** about with ego issues on both sides.do the job u put ur self up for and were elected to do!"
"probably for the best. nobody who stood doesn't have leather for skin anyway. i'm sure it'll be handshakes and smiles at the next meeting before we on the dramallama for the next set of fun rides. don't worry about all this froth. as long as we keep pumping through the issues we are actually doing the job."
"the council will be able to vote for its own chair and i'll probably get to sit back and sip fine wine. but at least i'll have cat-herded some decent issues onto the agenda and made a progressive change to the constitution in the inaugural csm.nice, but remember those other 8 players that were also on the council and voted on those 'cat-herded' issues?plus, you are forgetting, it isn't the csm's or chair's responsibility to make changes to the constitution. all such matters should be directed to ccp to make rulings on, such as alternates in meetings, muting representatives etc.you have no more power in a meeting than any other csm representative. you can chair the meeting, but a failure of a meeting is your responsibility and no one elses. you have no rights to make 'final rulings' etc. read the documents again, then post the passages that give you those rights.take care,bruce hansen i still see you have yet to step down as chairman, despite your election promise."
"reposted from above:ccp did appoint a chair - the person with the most votes. and they charged that chairperson with leading the meetings. implicit in leading meetings is keeping some semblance of order and moving the discussion and agenda forward. while you suggest that the chair has no powers, the only documentation of how the csm is supposed to run says the chairperson runs the meetings.it would have been nice if ccp had written detailed instructions, but they didn't. it's up to you guys to work together to keep things moving and the only instruction given is that jade's supposed to lead that effort. i think it's fair to argue with the exact nature of how he's supposed to do that, but to claim ccp's intention was that he have no authority on which to lead meetings is false, as it does say in the csm document that that is his job as chairperson."
"yawn. why do you keep flogging this dead horse? i said i'd do my best to get a change to the constitution that made the csm chair elected by the committee. i've written, publicly discussed, and commended the issue to the csm, its been added to the iceland agenda. if i manage to see this put into the constitution by vote and consultancy with ccp i'll step down and stand for re-election as chair under the new rules. if it doesn't get added to the constitution i won't. its fairly simple to understand. i want to ensure that no future csm session will be led by a person who wins the popular vote but isn't capable of chairing meetings. if i don't get this surety then there is no purpose to resigning and i'll stand as chair for the full session."
"nice job with the \"deflect and redirect.\"i've been entertained all day with a million posts about this and i still haven't seen you accept your fellow csm's view that you acted out of line. until that happens, i think the handshakes will be in short supply.what i've read of your responses in chat logs and forum posts have been a number of excuses, deflections, redirects, personal attacks, broad sweeping generalizations about player groups, and other blather. if you really think reconciliation is the appropriate way forward, showing you have the humility to admit you were wrong might go a long way in moving on.so will you admit that you acted out of line? (this question only needs a yes or no answer, but i don't see that coming.)"
"you have no freakin clue. all the bodies which have decisional powers i've interacted with are chaired by an entity which has power to maintain the discussions on track according to the agenda. this include the ability to stop a useless diatribe, expel a member for the duration of the session, or even abort and postpone said session.it's done the same way from shareholder up to parliament & house sessions. the number of occurrences of sentences which had nothing or little to do with the matter at hand in these chatlogs is staggering.so imho jade displayed quite a bit of restraint before acting. anyhow, the csm looks exactly how i was expecting it to be: a kindergarten full of overbloated egos."
"i'm going to say i made three mistakes: 1. i didn't restate the rules of discussion and debate in the meeting at the beginning. 2. i should have simply copy and pasted the vote intro's. 3. i should have taken a direct judgment on the simple majority thing (and should have known in advance what the doc said)for that stuff i'm happy to apologize and say i'll do better next time. but on the issue of muting a member of the council after 3 warnings in order to protect the process of a vote - absolutely not. i stand by that decision 100% and would do it again."
"yawn. why do you keep flogging this dead horse? i said i'd do my best to get a change to the constitution that made the csm chair elected by the committee. i've written, publicly discussed, and commended the issue to the csm, its been added to the iceland agenda. if i manage to see this put into the constitution by vote and consultancy with ccp i'll step down and stand for re-election as chair under the new rules. if it doesn't get added to the constitution i won't. its fairly simple to understand. i want to ensure that no future csm session will be led by a person who wins the popular vote but isn't capable of chairing meetings. if i don't get this surety then there is no purpose to resigning and i'll stand as chair for the full sessionthis issue keeps coming up because it's something you said you'd do before being elected, and now haven't done. again, i ask you where the passages are that give you the right to change the csm constitution? i see no evidence of submission of csm constitution stuff to ccp for rulings, just proposals and votes in the csm meetings.you have now put conditions on standing down as chair? i also see that agenda item 4 (science and industry) had the voting before discussion and during it. can you, as chairman, please explain clearly and concisely what the vote for this item was for and what forum posts we can expect to see in regard to the issues listed in the volumous pdf document?take care,bruce hansen"
"i've told you what i said. and thats precisely what i am doing."
"arithron where did you see this conditionless promise to stand down as chair if elected? i don't see it anywhere, are you sure about that?"
"it was in one of the live/chats interviews iirc. you deflected the question with irrelevant information. you didn't promise to look at the csm document and then attempt to change it. you promised to step down if you had that position and then let the council elect its own. you failed to meet that promise. i mean, how hard is it. you said you would do something and when the time came you didn't do it."
"again, i ask you where the passages are that give you the right to change the csm constitution? i see no evidence of submission of csm constitution stuff to ccp for rulings, just proposals and votes in the csm meetings.still managing to avoid this one, since its proving a little harder than you thought to find those passages?"
"oh, so it's posted as an mp3 or something somewhere? link?"
"probably not. not all of them were recorded. notice how jade isn't saying she didn't say it. if you want to look in archives of this thread he was called out on it. you will notice in that thread jade did not say he did not make the claim. only refused to do it."
"you can ask jade, since he isn't denying stating that he'd stand down as chairman take care,bruce hansen"
"lol, seriously, only way it can be done is for us to raise an issue on the topic (as i've done with the electable chair proposal) we'll present it to ccp and ask if we can do it. if they say yes \"its done\". if that happens i'll set down and we'll have an elected chair immediately. i really don't understand where you are going with this line of questioning."
"as far as i know there is no recording or mp3 or whatnot. it was an open vent session when i said i felt the csm should have an elected chair and if i got elected i'd lobby to get the constitution changed issue raise->ccp agreed. i got asked - what if you win and become chairman? i said i'd still push for the measure and step down for re-election when it was done. others have tried to make an issue of this. but really there is no issue. i'm intending to do what i said i'd do and try my best to get this measure though. if i can't get it through then i have absolutely no intention of resigning and i will stand as chair for the session regardless."
"actually, you are supposed to be presenting to ccp player issues, not csm constitution ones. you seem to make decisions in meetings and through votes that will not be put to ccp. this, frankly, is an abuse of power by the csm, and not its purpose. csm mechanisms, if in doubt, should be clarified through ccp directly, not group decisions by the chair and representatives. before clarification, if it takes some time to come, you should be guided by the csm documents...which give you no rights to change/decide/propose alterations of the csm constitution.besides, any issue that is discussed and voted upon must be put to the players via the threads for 7 days...bruce hansen"
"no, seriously. the csm document clearly states that the chairman can step down and the council can elect a new chairman. the \"way\" it happens is if you buck up and step down like you claimed. do i have to get the quote and the page for you like we've had show you the chatlogs proving you are wrong in the primary matter of this thread?"
"it was"
"actually, i was referring to other csm issues apart from the chairman one...such as alternates/abstaining etc.i'm also asking for the written evidence that allows the csm to vote on these matters at all. you have produced no evidence regarding ccp rulings on any matters regarding csm constitution changes or csm meetings etc.bruce hansen"
"indeed and herein lies the problem as i've expressed elsewhere i feel that the csm shouldn't have to spend all it's time trying to piece together a way for it to work and should in fact be discussing the issues that matter to us. who is at fault in the end? well i don't think it's jade, i don't think it's darius or ank or any other csm member i think the problem lies entirely with ccps inability to organise it properly in the first place."
"or the inability of the csm to actually ask ccp for rulings and guidance on these matters. instead, they chose to act outside their scope entirely....bruce hansen"
"thats because we're making it up as we go along arithron. sorry but there it is. i mean we could have met first time and said:\"what shall we do?\" \"dunno\"\"ummm what should we do?\"\"dunno\"\"how should we handle all this stuff?\"\"dunno\"\"we know! lets ask ccp!\"\"meeting adjourned\"\"drinks on me! great meeting everyone!\"(next meeting)\"so what did they say?\" \"umm nothing really\"\"what?\" \"yeah they said its all in the documentation\"\"umm\"\"what?\"\"lets ask for clarification!\"\"excellent meeting adjourned!\"\"great meeting guys drinks on me!\"instead we opted yes, to make it up as we went along and try and score the win condition of taking a bunch of issues to iceland from a running start with 3 weeks and a bunch of forum trolling to put up with. end of the day we're going make that win condition and i for one am pretty happy to say to the electorate that they made the right choice to elect some can-do grifters in the role rather than a bunch of people who wouldn't dare take a move without everything signed and sealed in triplicate with the favorable entrails of a dove and the blessing of a local clergyman. have we made mistakes? hell yes. have we at least got something done hell yes. lets have a big drink of glass half full here and look on the bright side you bunch of moody so-and-sos!"
"so every record of jade's position on this is consistent, except for the one recounted by an unknown person who heard it differently late one night?"
"who are you calling a moody so-and-so? i think you do a disservice to those candidates who were unsuccessful by suggesting that they would have not applied themselves diligently to the job as most of the csm representatives have done.your assertions regarding ccp are frankly unfair, as you did have a ccp member in your first meeting where you could have put csm mechanism specifics to get clarification. besides, i am sure they would have given requests from the csm on csm matters good thought and prompt response.it still gives the csm no right to 'make things up' and step outside their remit, as specified in the csm documentation. that was an error i am glad to see you have finally admitted to. thank you. time for the csm to send a mail to ccp regarding some csm mechanism questions and constitutional matters eh?take care,bruce hansen"
"after reading the lengthy chatlog of the recent meeting of the csm, it becomes quite apparent that they really need a neutral arbitrator torun the meetings. someone with no vote, who enforces rules of order and the like, and can keep the meeting from turning into a free for all. it was quite clear that inanna didn't think jade had the authourity to give \"warnings\" and it was also clear that jade was frustrated by what he felty were disturbances to the voting process. this could be solved by someone with no personal agenda as a representative conducting the meeting in a neutral fashion. this person would have no vote, and their only goal would be to make sure that everything is handled fairly and even handedly. something along the lines of the parliamentary \"speaker of the house\" (at least the way it's used here in canada.)"
"more people, more imaginary and misunderstood powers, more fail"
"to clarify re i am quite happy that a chair should be able to warn a member that they have done something clearly *wrong* but in both cases, as i had not (indeed past meetings have had comments from others clearly disruptive to the smooth flow of the meeting) i asked for a clarification of what i was supposed to have done and what a \"warning\" actually signified. instead of getting answers to my questions (and neither did others get responses when they asked) i was muted and locked out of the discussion. imho far exceeding any 'authority' that the chair may have.iz"
"] jade constantine > i hope these are steps that will never be needed(this led to a vote on the principle of operator rights that confirmed that csm officers would maintain operator rights)yesterday i took your request for re-clarification of this statement on record to be spurious and again an attempt to prevent the vote in progress from coming to a conclusion. the discussion was over. we'd moved to the vote. you were not locked out of the discussion. you were muted to prevent you continuing to obstruct the process of the vote. as you can see from the timing of the log i attempted to un-mute you the moment after i formally called for voting preferences."
"you're grasping at straws if you think any amount of silencing a person on that council for any circumstance is acceptable."
"obviously i disagree with you. (i'm disagreeing with a lot of goons today it seems)."
"say the guy role playing e-hookers :rolleyes:"
"stop lying liar.this is the vote in question[2008.05.31 19:31:38 ] jade constantine > everyone in favour of everyone having op rights in the csm channel say aye :<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:44 ] ankhesentapemkah > yes for universal op rights.<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:45 ] inanna zuni > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:52 ] darius johnson > no<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:55 ] jade constantine > nay<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:56 ] serenity steele > no<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:56 ] dierdra vaal > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:31:58 ] lavista vista > nay<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:32:04 ] bane glorious > gonna go with nay<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:32:21 ] tusko hopkins > aye<U+FEFF>[ 2008.05.31 19:32:43 ] jade constantine > thats a no then ...so it looks like you are again redefining a vote to suit your needs. note how there is nothing in that vote that says \"the csm chairman retains op rights and the ability to mute others\" it simply says that this right should not be given to everyone. it does not say, anywhere that the right should be given to anyone, just that it should not be given to everyonethe discussion then moved on to the template document."
"i think this again demonstrates the need for a neutral arbitrator with no vote. clearly there is a point of view issue here, and neither side is being objective on the issue. this is what i believe in the end will make the csm useless. some good things were done in that meeting, but it has already started to degenerate. personalities will always clash, as will ideas and what some people think is right and wrong. a neutral arbitrator with a clearly defined set of rules and practices can help keep the process working, instead of degenerating into a free for all."
"i choose verone...maybe sirmolle"
"chribba might also be a good choice."
"isn't there some sort of scandinavian word for this kind of role? ombudsman? is that what this arbitrator would be?"
"an ombudsman is more of a supervisory position that would check onthings for the public interest. (like a legislative investigator.) what i'm thinking of is someone who would attaempt to keep the peace in a csm meeting using something like \"robert's rules of order\" or something similar, so that issues could be discussed and voted on without bogging down forever, and things could be accomplished. it also has the advantage of helping meetings not become overlong, etc."
"arbitrators are cool but you might need something with more firepower here. perhaps an abaddon."
"all that needs to happen here is for the csm who do not have the floor to shut up, until the chair gives them the floor. that is the essence of their job. if the chair fails to fairly grant the floor, ask ccp to replace them.looking at the logs, it is obvious half of the group have no clue how to behave in a text meeting. the next meeting should have jade directly giving the floor to an individual, priority based on the item list sponsor as a primary speaker and secondarily to impromptu requests for the floor. in all cases the only interruption is a ! in the chat. abuse and repeated interjection would be the only justification for muting. in the case of this meeting, it was chaos from the start due to people feeling anarchy was the mode and nobody was their boss. somebody is different, and that is the chairman. they sort the traffic.word to the chairman:never paraphrase the content of a vote. cut and paste verbatim.word to the committee:shush till you have the floor!"
"this, and everything will be fine."
"yes.to properly fulfil their roles csm members must be emotionally invested in their motions.to properly maintain order a speaker must be emotionally detatched.csm members can't act as speaker as well as debating motions."
"sounds like a good idea to me. i'll try my best to make sure this happens."
"totally agree, we don't need the worst of goonies in the csm, keep bane, remove darius."
"i am sure darius would gladly step down to a suitable replacement if it meant jade was removed as well :)"
"does anyone else see the irony in being called a simpleton by someone who doesn't understand basic punctuation?i agree however out with that awful darius! what with his powertrips and frequent abuse of moderation abilities!"
"great post. i especially like the part about not going to read the thread and then not not going to read this thread again later."
"naw. darius wouldn't step down. you're forgetting his ego. must really burn his cookies the way everyone seems to prefer bane over him.windjammer"

"after a power outage, i just got around to finishing my reading of the chatlogs, and i'm pretty ****ed off at the conduct of the meeting. the chair decided to arbitrarily mute a member of the council who had done nothing wrong \"til the vote\", and then proceeded to re-mute her twice more without ever actually letting the block off until after the vote had already taken place. and this was on the basis of two \"formal warnings\" for conduct that is entirely normal in a text-based meeting - the first was for calling a point of order, and the second was for taking marginally longer to type a comment than it took jade to ask for silence. this is abuse of power of the highest order on the part of the chair, and i'm incredibly disappointed to see it. also, on the issue of abstentions, it's a total non-issue, and the fact that a minute was spent on it is wasteful, let alone an hour. abstention = afk = absent from meeting, except as regards quorum and replacement by alternates. if \"aye\" > \"nay\", the motion passes, and if \"nay\" <= \"aye\", the motion fails. abstentions have no weight whatsoever - serenity is appallingly wrong when he says that they be counted as nays, and ankh is understandably wrong(but still wrong) when she says that majority-abstain is a failed vote. if eight of you abstain and one aye vote is cast, the motion is passed. it's the same as what happens if, say, 90% of eligible eve accounts choose not to cast a csm ballot - we don't throw out the results, we simply record the votes of those who chose to cast a vote, and go from there."
"this is actually a technical problem we discovered with the chat channel : the first notification of a mute is where i muted inanna (following polite requests, and two formal warnings against disruptive conduct.) the second notification of a mute (immediately before the vote) is actually me clicking \"un-mute\" which for some bizarre reason doesn't work and ends up kicking the person from the channel. the third notification of a mute is actually the un-mute once she'd been reinvited to the channel by me. = there are technical problems with the mute system in that channel. (we checked all this afterwards btw).but technical issues aside: its the role of the chair to moderate meetings. if people are refusing to ask to be recognized by the chair before speaking (while other csm members are quite happy to do this) then its the responsibility of the chair to ensure that steps are taken when this conduct damages our ability to make progress. polite requests were made, warnings were given. i took the step to mute the representative when she point blank refused to remain quiet while a vote was being conducted. the vice chair agreed with this step. ultimately the csm reps need to respect the authority of the chair to moderate meetings. if they don't then no progress can be made. if people don't like the way i handled this they are free to complain to ccp or whatever. but i'll continue to do my best to ensure we actually get things done rather than spending fruitless periods listening to endless cross talk and interruptions while other csm reps are actually respecting the process of the meeting and waiting to be recognized before speaking their own points. well as it turned out it was a complete non-issue. and it would have taken about 1 minute to resolve had we been able to move to a vote of principle on the issue in a timely and disciplined fashion. there is a lesson here."
"i am jade constantine, god chairman and emperor of the csmbow before my unpopular and unsupported issues lest i mute you"
"or post a wall of text that does not address your question, that too is one of the many e-weapons in my e-arsenal"
"] jade constantine > innana i'm giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chairaside from a (totally unnecessary) grammar edit on inanna's part, which she'd been doing all night, you just gave her a warning for not looking at the screen during an 8-second window, plus or minus lag, between when you could be interpreted to have called for silence and when she finished typing her message, or a 4-second window after you clarified slightly. call me crazy, but a warning over taking a bit too long to type a response is abusive, and destructive of respect for the chair.immediately after the second \"formal warning\", inanna asked for clarification of exactly what the warning meant. for that matter, so did hardin and lavista, which implies to me that nobody knew what you were doing. you certainly hadn't specified up until that point in the chatlogs, but the fact that three people questioned its meaning and darius questioned its validity means that i can safely say you also hadn't specified it anywhere else, which means you can't blame inanna for not knowing what she was being warned against or what the consequences of ignoring those warnings would be. those things are standard for any warning anywhere, either int he form of rules of order, contempt of court laws, or something else of that nature, or they're contained within the warning themselves, but you didn't provide them, which makes confusion basically inevitable. and apparently, this confusion and questioning of your decision were mute-worthy.while it is certainly the right of the chair to prevent members from disrupting the meeting, it is also the right of members to question, request clarification of, and even formally challenge and seek to overturn the rulings of the chair under all rules of order i've ever seen. not only did you ignore those rights, you disrespected them flagrantly, by silencing a member of the council who was seeking to do no more than exercise her rights as a member. you acted against the proper proceedings of a deliberative assembly, and misused your powers as chair to do so. your actions were abusive and generally reprehensible, and deserve condemnation in the strongest terms, and if i were at the table my first actions would be to nail down these amorphous rules of order well enough to find a way to eject you from the chair.i'm willing to accord you quite a number of rights due to your electoral standing, but dictatorial powers are not among them.oh, and tress, stfu. you're not helping."
"excerpts: these logs are getting longer and longer and the rules increasingly seem to be either still unclear or just a facade."
"why couldn't you have just stuck to the issues jade instead of trying to turn the csm into some sort of toy"
"jade constantine failing to explain his decisions, then muting people to avoid confrontation?who could have seen this coming?"
"very classy."
"both, actually. the rules are naturally unclear, because the constitution of the csm is a pr pitch, as opposed to a quasi-legal document. ccp is their usual overworked selves, and they haven't clarified further, and nobody at the csm is lawyerly enough to have forced proper rules of order upon the council yet. thing is, power abhors a vacuum even more than nature does. if there's unclear rules, every side will push as hard as it can to gain more power for itself - darius, as a common member, is agitating for the rights of common members at every opportunity and the utter irrelevance of the chair, and jade, as chair, is trying to define himself into far more power than anybody else probably wants him to have. they're both pushing for far more than they ought to get, but between their personalities and philosophies, and the fact that they're trying to further their own interests(which will make anybody fight a little bit harder) i'm not surprised by their actions at all. it's also true of every other organization with multiple power bases i can think of that's not bound in by some pretty ironclad law - the house of commons has spent 800 years hedging out the crown and lords, by means ranging from financial threats, to questionable constitutional changes, to civil war and regicide. presidents from andrew jackson to george w bush have sought to expand the power of the executive beyond that which their predecessors enjoyed, and congress has constantly pushed back. the fact that jade and darius(and others, of course, but those two are the most egregious) are doing the same thing here doesn't surprise me and, sadly, neither does the fact that they're both being so bush-league about it. but at the same time as i'm unsurprised that somebody will take up the banners of the anarchist and the tyrant, i'm disappointed by those who do. darius needs to calm down and get past his 4th-grade civics notion of absolute, universal equality in all things, and jade needs to get down off his high horse and acknowledge the rightful limits on his role as chair. and until both of them do that, there will continue to be unnecessary strife that makes them all look like children, or worse, politicians. i hope iceland solves the problem - face-to-face discussion is almost inevitably less bloodthirsty than text-based - but i'm not excessively optimistic about the good functioning of this council over the next five and a half months. i hope to be proven wrong, but the issues at hand seem too fundamental, and being stifled in those issues seems too likely to provoke bitterness, for these hatchets to be buried among this group."
"serves me right for voting for jade. i thought he could handle the responsibility of csm in a reasonable manner. boy was i wrong. my worry was that the goons would **** up the process. jade's actually making them look good, ironically. edit: after re-reading the logs, all joking aside, i'm pretty disgusted with the pettiness and immaturity jade showed multiple times throughout the meeting."
"don't you know he is very important in the eve online community"
"postcount = notoriety = respector maybe in his case, wordcount..."
"i find it quite ironic about how people were screaming for the ability to remove a chairman, should the goons get a chairman with the intention of griefing the council. but now it seems like it's turned around anyways. yesterday was an absolute fiasco. the way jade conducted himself is, as pointed out, unacceptable in my eyes. not only did he unrightfully mute inanna, based on vague and unreasonable reasons, he also totally ignored certain council members and had no respect for the fact that people had a real life. this resulted in the meeting taking 2 hours longer than expected. that's 4 hours total!and why? well, i will let those who read the chatlogs judge for themselves. but it's pretty damn clear why such a huge deal was made out of it, resulting in this chaos.hopefully everybody will learn something from this, so that we don't waste so much time next time."
"it seemed like during the meetings they came up with new issues constantly. how about next time you make a vote for an issue along the lines of \"only issues previously stated in our csm forum, or in the alliance hall forum can be brought to the csm meetings\" this would cut down on the lengths of the meetings drastically. it would also allow more debate since you can look through the threads and read them rather and try and prove your point in a 2 hour timespan.maybe make a vote for the removal of a chair if he does an inefficient job, one that takes longer than 3 hours to do, counts as inefficiency."
"i think a more important issue though is the \"righteos instigator\" that darius johnson is playing. through out the meeting and especially in the last quarter he baited jade and company multiple times. he was trying to push the meeting even farther off topic into a all out brawl.examples:[ 2008.06.08 21:36:25 ] darius johnson > your warnings don't mean a thing fyi[ 2008.06.08 21:46:20 ] darius johnson > well she did get two official warnings<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:46:29 ] darius johnson > maybe the channel is enforcing rule![ 2008.06.08 21:58:21 ] darius johnson > well it's cool, just mute them next time you don't like what they're saying and we'll be cool[ 2008.06.08 22:01:24 ] darius johnson > so what? who the hell are you?[ 2008.06.08 22:02:43 ] darius johnson > let's just mute everyone and move onif the csm wants to be taken seriously then that kind of behavior can't be condoned."
"i'm not going to defend darius' actions. but he makes some fine points.though it could be considered childish, at least he didn't interupt the meeting nor did he mute people."
"even if they're both being an ass to the same degree, darius isn't going around censoring people. jade's conduct needs to be addressed well before anybody else's, for that reason alone."
"maybe because this is an internet spaceships committee for internet spaceships pilots to discuss internet spaceships? the committee isn't some 'ultimate roleplaying device' just for jade to obsess over constantly and acquire more and more e-spaceship power in. if jade is going to act up and pretend (s)he is some super important person with new and growing authorities rather than what (s)he actually is, then someone should just tell him to sit down and shut it. enter darius."
"i'd like to see someone held accountable for the cluster**** that was meeting 3. especially, disenfranchising ianna's constituency.ridiculous, utterly ridiculous."
"that would get you muted. but you could always abstain, of course!"
"is this is the bit where i grin smugly in the knowledge that i did not vote for jade constantine?"
"most rules of order i've seen for bodies like this allow for impeachment of a member with a 2/3 vote. i've never implemented such a vote, so i've never looked at whether it can be narrowed to just stripping their roles while leaving their seat intact(since i have no objections to jade's conduct as a member thus far), but i'd imagine that it's possible to do so. seems to me there's an obvious target for such a motion."
"reading that log made me think, damn, goonfleet is cool."
"oh csm. i knew jade would provide me the comedy so much needed in this forum."
"this"
"laffing at the people who voted for jade, that's a pretty funny chatlog right there, keep up the good work !"
"is that for roleplaying a nymphomaniac gallentean hooker, or whatever he's into.or has odo actually achieved something in this game?"
"jade alt spotted"

"hate to tell you i told you so... but i did.although it seems a vote of no confidence vote in the csm chair has been supported by a csm member meaning it can be brought up at the next meeting. when it is i would hope that all those csm representatives who feel that jade constantine has acted in a disgusting manner vote no confidence in him.maybe then the csm can spend time discussing matters of importance instead of having 4 hour long meeting where they are lectured at by a man child who has never had a position of power in his life."
"maybe you should discuss whether you should discuss if the left or right arm should be used for voting. i guess you could fill two hours that way."
"i would just like to point out one thing about the 'chat log' posted here.the chat log came from a member of the committee who had channel rights, which is why it contains a note about inanna being muted by jade.unfortunately, the other members of the committee, who do not have channel rights, did not see that notification and therefore had no idea that jade had gagged inanna and jade didn't inform us.i only became aware that inanna had been gagged when she mentioned it to me in a separate convo."
"left arm no doubt. i'm left-handed and won't have right-handed buggers get their way."
"the plot thickens"
"ok, i just got home from my exam. so i went a bit trough the logs.from meeting 2, while discussing time limits, jade wrote:[ 2008.05.31 19:27:09 ] jade constantine > if somebody is disruptive i'd ask them to stop[ 2008.05.31 19:27:20 ] jade constantine > if they don't stop i'll eventually give a warning[ 2008.05.31 19:27:25 ] jade constantine > then a second warning[ 2008.05.31 19:27:33 ] jade constantine > then use the mute function outside of votingso it seems to me like this will happen to a person who is disruptive:1. first warning.2. second warning.3. mute.this means a person effectively have to disrupt 3 times. so lets look at the logs from yesterday:[ 2008.06.08 19:47:37 ] jade constantine > no inanna i'm giving you a formal warning[ 2008.06.08 21:35:52 ] jade constantine > innana i'm giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chair[ 2008.06.08 21:36:58 ] eve system > inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine., effective until 2008.06.08 22:06:57, reason: \"till the vote\".[ 2008.06.08 21:40:29 ] eve system > inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine., effective until 2008.06.08 21:10:28.[ 2008.06.08 21:44:06 ] eve system > inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine., effective until 2008.06.08 21:14:05.[ 2008.06.08 21:49:30 ] jade constantine > you were muted after a 2nd formal warning for disruptive behavior innanawell?"
"what gives jade the right to mute people he deems disruptive other than his own mind? he made up a punishment system and then enforced it unilaterally without consultation. a dictator indeed."
"lol. what a chatlog :p almost coad quality.however, after reading the logfile i found the chairmans behaviour to be inappropriate. ianna was by no means disruptive in a way that would have justified a mute or even a \"formal warning\" *g*.i believe the chairman should abstain from muting people in the future and state an apology at last."
"my logs look like this: [ 2008.06.08 21:35:52 ] jade constantine > innana i'm giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chair<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:08 ] jade constantine > now then:<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:11 ] inanna zuni > and what do you mean by that?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:13 ] hardin > what is a formal warning?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:19 ] lavista vista > i'm sorry jade?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:21 ] inanna zuni > \"formal warning\" is a misnomer<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:25 ] darius johnson > your warnings don't mean a thing fyi<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:35 ] inanna zuni > and how can i be interriptiing when i am completeing what i type?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:36:57 ] eve system > inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine., effective until 2008.06.08 22:06:57, reason: \"till the vote\".***we had reached an issue that needed to be handled within that meeting. we had csm members that that believed we needed a full majority 5/9 yes for an issue to reach the agenda, we had csm members who believed simple majority was enough. we had been through one vote already that inanna had refused to vote on and virtually protested through. now we needed clarification because it was ridiculous and would have been a failure on the part of the chair to allow a meeting to close with the csm split on what the interpretation of a successful vote actually was.

"jade, how will you be voting on the issue of no confidence in your position as csm chair?i also note that you posted another few thousand characters that don't address the issue in question. here i'll make it nice and bold for you.why did you mute a csm member for no real reason?the logs you posted don't make your case any stronger. you got angry that people weren't respecting your non-existant authority. at one point you gave her a \"formal warning\" (something you can't give because you have no authority to do so) for typing something that was sent in the same second as your statement for her to stop talking."
"as to the general complaints about muting raised here. i stand 100% behind what i did. and i'd do exactly the same next time, to any csm member who ignores 2 formal warnings on disruptive behaviour. i'm expecting certain rules of courtesy from csm members in council and these need to be respected if this process is going to go anywhere. its been established that raising a hand \"!\" in channel is to be used to indicate a desire to speak. from there the chair recognizes individuals by name and they speak in order as called. once we've moved to a vote on an issue it is not appropriate to continue debating against the notion of the vote - clarification can be asked for, its considered respectful behaviour to listen to clarification while its being given. now text based meetings of this sort are extremely challenging - there is no verbal queue, no eye contact, and very little peer pressure on members of the council to behave properly. yesterday's session is an example of what happens when moderation from the chair is not followed. we managed to get through the agenda by pure force of will and stubborn resolve on the part of the csm officers however - if we'd ended on time - items 6 to 17 on the agenda would not have been heard. but it does show there are problems. i'm pretty unhappy with the in-game chat system and its functionality in this medium. the mute function does not work as it should do, the word limits mean that statements are broken up and its too easy for people to interrupt and break the flow of meaning. i'd personally be much happier with a voice meeting or even using irc chat where the moderation functions work correctly. end of the day though, that agenda was discussed and resolved and what needed clarifying got clarified. i repeat, i'm a 100% behind the moderation decisions taken and will do exactly the same thing next time if people refuse to respect the process of the meeting and keep cross-talking and interrupting and behaving disruptively."
"what about chairmen who ignores other council members'(notice plural) motions. can they be muted too?"
"i suggest the csm think seriously about appointing a speaker so that decisions like this aren't taken by people involved in the debates."
"ironically, for a group concerned with keeping a business meeting model for the csm's meetings they seem to have overlooked one item that's usually traditional for this style.namely that the chairman should not be voting.his/her position is simply to regulate the flow of the meetings and to cast a deciding vote only if the vote is tied between the other council members."
"so the person who got the most votes should not be allowed to vote ???i agree that there should be a neutral chairman but only ccp could provide this person. dont get fooled into the idea that any player is actually neutral.as on the drama in this thread, you cant have a chairman w/o the tools to actually chair. muting might not be the best way but possibly the only atm. it wouldnt be needed if people would actually behave and wait till its their turn.... well i forgot... they are all super special equal."
"now it's the in-game chat system's fault you muted a csm member without due authority."
"chair has the authority to mute disruptive csm reps."
"the majority of the csm representatives did not find inannas behaviour disruptiveat last, from what i can tell by reading the chatlog."
"that is also what i thought. quite a few of us questioned the call."
"find that quote in the csm document please. not a vague sentence that may or may not mean it, the quote itself. because clearly if you are saying so authoritatively that you have this ability it would be backed up in writing for everyone to see. it would, of course, not be only mentioned in the chatlogs of a meeting where you decide (without any vote) that these are your powers and how you will be enforcing them."
"where did that authority come from? besides your mind i mean."
"i'm telling you the chair has the authority to moderate meetings. that can involve muting disruptive csm members in extreme circumstances. we can get involved in debate as to whether silencing a council member for 30secs while the chair was actually stating the terms of a vote that would allow us to finish a meeting that had already overrun by 2 hours is - \"extreme circumstances\" by all means. but ultimately i made the call and i'd do it again. if any csm members feel this was wrong then its their right to bring up an issue for the next agenda proposing specific rules or limitations on moderation or indeed ideas as to how one does deal with ongoing and disruptive cross-talk and interruptions to keep a 2 hour meeting under a 4 hour timespan without having the sanction to silence a member who has already ignored repeated requests to follow the protocol of the meeting.bring it to a vote by all means. if the csm does manage to vote itself out of all moderation in text chat then we'll see where that takes us."
"so i was right. you did just make that up. it's not stated anywhere in the official documents."
"jade: quite aside from your pathetic little power trip, the fact that you allowed a meeting to run two hours overtime clearly demonstrates your sad lack of competence at performing the most basic role of a chairman. the csm may well be the most important thing going in your life right now, but it's a gross mistake on your part to assume that the same is true for the other members of the committee. you have not accepted the responsibility for allowing the meeting to run so horrendously overtime. you have not acknowledged your role in ejecting an elected representative from the meeting and holding a vote in her absence. such complete ineptitude would not be excusable from the chairperson of a high-school debate, yet you can somehow manage to write an after-action report congratulating yourself on a job well done.furthermore, your inability in both this and your own csm thread to reply to any criticisms of your positions or attitudes, coupled with your repeatedly-stated intentions to ignore a sizable percentage of the playerbase that you have been elected to represent, demonstrate that you are barely competent at performing your role as a csm representative, let alone that of the chairperson."
"within wishing to interrupt the flow of goon flaming too much, could i ask a little favor and suggest you skip over to meeting 4 sign off on items 12th june 20:00 hours and continue your wild flights of fancy and hilarious attempts to wind me up there please? (thats the current agenda for issues sign off that we need to get done by thursday and if you'd care to troll and flame me in that thread we can serve the dual purpose of keeping it bumped and letting you have your fun)fair enough?"
"maybe you could just mute them here? *scuttles off snickering*"
"do not attempt to belittle the serious concerns that have been raised in this thread about your abilities as a csm chair. they are serious and concerning. and considering the majority of them relate to your conduct in the meeting this thread is about surely this is the correct place for them.(post here if you think jade is dum)"
"guys, give jade a couple of meetings more to get into it. might be he is just on a power-trip, but might also be that chairing meetings if you are not used to it is a pain in the ass, and chairing meetings in text is a real pain in the ass, and more so to someone who is used to being a charismatic dramatic colorful character type instead of a neutral, careful mediator type. also do bear in mind jade did not ask to be the chair - in fact, he's asked the procedure to be changed from the one that made him so.that said, i agree completely on the following points:- the muting was jumping the gun. from the logs, the meeting was obviously getting heated and people were getting tired (not the least jade himself). what should have been done was to call a break, let everyone cool off, and continue separately. - the idea that abstains count as no is bizarre in this case. abstains should count as votes not cast. that is the point of abstaining in this kind of a meeting - letting whoever does have an opinion decide."
"wow. i mean, is this a seriouspost? you've been called out by many people, some of them goons, some of them fellow csm members (non goon) and this is your reply? beating people over the head with wordswordswordswords doesn't make you less wrong.p.s. is breathing still a reflex? or do you pass out a lot?"
"postin"
"is there some good reason to do this in terrible text format? there is no way you're ever going to moderate anything as its not a discussion it looks like this:just do it via voice coms so there is as little miscommunication as possible and so it has the pretense of question and answer. after all no one's accent is so egregious that this misbegotten text \"method\" offers any advantage. i think the csm was so preoccupied with being romantically political and transparent that it forget no has ever had a meaningful exchange in between the lols and other dross."
"ok; i've been debating making a comment or not in this thread, and need to quickly state a couple of points.1. where, precisely, was i being \"disruptive\"? and where, precisely, was that \"extreme circumstances\"? (i'm leaving aside the question of whether you even have the right to mute an elected representative for the moment)i noted during the meeting that jade was editorialising positions and not being a neutral chair (indeed arguably *the* function of being the chair of a committee). in my opinion it went downhill from there.i don't know where this might have been \"established\" but the meeting last night was the *first* time anyone used this mechanism (<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:22:13 ] serenity steele > !) which was without explanation. maybe a back channel somewhere without all members present?further, i have been accused by the chair of interrupting. example:<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:26 ] jade constantine > please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin ?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:29 ] hardin > 2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reason<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 18:33:41 ] jade constantine > @ inanna please stop interruptingi'm sorry to point out that i see no interruption by me, so?on-line meetings have their own particular difficulties, not only the prevalence of spelling errors but primarily based around lag time (comms delay, reading-typing delay, multi-line comments interleaving) so asking for comments needs to be clearly separated from asking for the vote to permit time for responses. however:<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 19:24:51 ] jade constantine > does anyone actually oppose this issue ?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 19:25:15 ] jade constantine > moving to a vote then ... all those in favour-<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 20:09:32 ] jade constantine > anybody else want to speak on the issue ?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 20:10:04 ] jade constantine > okay then lets move to a vote on the principle of raising this discussion with ccpand when i tried to actually respond you kept interrupting until<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 20:11:46 ] darius johnson > you can let inanna finish-<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 20:35:32 ] jade constantine > yep anyone against this one ?<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 20:36:10 ] jade constantine > kk moving to the vote-etc.then lets look at voting; instead of noting whether everyone has voted and waiting until they have you pre-empt things.

"yes the meeting was overlong. but we were caught on the horns of dilemma there. any issues that didn't get heard at that meeting were not getting on the iceland agenda since they needed to be agreed and then have written documentation produced this coming thursday for submission to ccp. and if you review the logs - we actually got through the substantive issues in about an hour - and spent 3 hours arguing about complete tosh. yes i was tired, yes i was hot and frustrated and yes i really wanted the meeting to end. but we had a seriously problem. half the csm thought the vote on issue 3 had failed, half the csm thought it was successful. thats where all the \"wtf does abstention mean?\" debate came from. sure in the cold light of day i'm going to put my hand up now and say what i should have done was say: \"i'm making a call on this this - chair says we're using simple majority voting - moving on.\"(though i'm guessing that would have led to some toys being thrown out of prams and more accusations of chair claiming too much authority again - sometimes you can't win).but as it was we needed to get clarity on that issue to prevent a situation where ank was going to produce minutes showing one result for issue 3 where half the csm thought it had gone the other way.i'd dearly have loved to call a break elebeth, but we'd not have reconvened afterwards - people were desperate to be away and it would have led to us denying the electorate the chance to get some of their issues on the agenda. for all the drama and spats and foot-stamping and goon-trolling its led too i'm glad to have persevered and gotten to the end of the agenda. what led to me mute inanna was her interference in the two separate votes on the simple majority issue. doesn't matter she was right - (and i agreed with her on the principle) what mattered is that she was further stalling the process of a lengthy and fractious meeting by arguing against us having a vote to decide the issue. if she had gotten her way and there had been no vote we'd be arguing right now about whether issue 3 had passed or not, since at the midpoint of that meeting we had 4 csm reps: serenity steele, dierdra vaal, darius and bane[ 2008.06.08 19:41:38 ] bane glorious > i'm voting a because that's what the csm document's rules say<U+FEFF> supporting the principle that 5/9 majority is required for a vote to pass. 3 csm reps: ank, lavista, and myself supporting the principle that simple majority is required. 1 csm rep (hardin/tusko) not available to vote. and 1 csm rep inanna refusing to vote because: [ 2008.06.08 19:40:26 ] inanna zuni > i *choose* to decline to support or reject this proposalas it ended up that vote finished 4 yes 3 no (2 no opinions) which would actually have pushed through the notion of 5/9 majority voting being required. but it didn't finish the argument since 2 of the 3 no voters and 1 abstainer refused to accept the verdict believing (correctly as it turned out) that it contradicted the spirit of the founding csm document. hence the secondary vote on the issue with more information (supplied by tusko) that led ultimately to an overturn of the earlier decision and confirmation of the principle of simple majority voting. sometime you just need to get the vote done. people have a time to object. once noted they need to shut up and vote (or abstain) - interfering with the process of a vote will earn a mute."

"\"goon-trolling\"? i fail to see any occur last night (are you?)somewhat selective there! that comment was way after i had voted \"abstain\" (see post above) and was not part of any vote; it was a response following:<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 19:39:52 ] ankhesentapemkah > noone has the right to force you to choose, dierdra.<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 19:40:16 ] jade constantine > option a: 5/9 needed to make the agenda .... option b: simple majority needed<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 19:40:25 ] jade constantine > please choosewhich, by no stretch of an imagination, is a call to a vote when the members present *had already voted*. it is, however, an example of bullying to try and get the result you wanted.and as i have noted in the posts above, if you are giving people a \"time to object\" you need to actually wait and *give* them that time. their responding to you call to comment is not an 'interference' in any way. ps. saying \"vote (or abstain)\" is a tautology as 'abstain' *is* a vote. btw. having read the full logs now, might i enquire re the following:<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:59:06 ] jade constantine > if we want to do this discussion lavista - i muted her for the 3 specific instance of her blocking the ability to move to a vote with disruptive behavourso again, as i and others have requested, where are the 3 specific instance of her blocking the ability to move to a vote with disruptive behavour (sic)? i have no \"blocking\" ability (although you subsequently demonstrated that you do)iz"
"talking about this thread obviously."
"how else would you interpret 4 yes votes, 3 no votes, and 2 csm candidates that refuse to register a vote? i recorded you'd cast no meaningful vote (effectively an abstain) so the measure passed by simple majority voting 4 to 3. ultimately inanna you need to examine your own behaviour as well. look back through the log and count the number of comments you interject without asking to be recognized by the chair, look at your reaction to a vote being called, look at the generally insulting and demeaning way you post with accusations against the competence of other reps, continual correcting of grammar or spelling, haranguing other reps and the chair and generally refusing to be called to order. i'm not expecting any kind of democratic resolution here inanna, but i'm going to tell you right now that if you keep behaving as you did in that last meeting then i'll be warning you each time you speak without asking to be recognized and i'll be doing this not to bully or intimidate you, but since it is the only way to be fair to the other csm reps, and to the electorate that voted for us to actually make progress in these committee meetings rather than listen to 101 interjections and snippy one-liners. maybe the sensible thing to do would have been to adjourn the meeting in the face of the interruptions and disruptive antics - but i didn't feel like punishing those members of the electorate who wanted their issues discussed for the crimes of a badly behaved csm.if you (or any other) csm rep don't think this is reasonable then you have the option of tabling a motion to suggest how we moderate these meetings in the future."
"see my post for instance number one above, would like hardin and other csm's imput as well."
"sadly we've been told we have to use eve-chat. i agree with you its horrible. there are terrible problems with text chat meetings particular in the moderation - there is simply no useful way to stop people interrupting and cross-talking over recognized speakers without muting them. which as we see from this thread makes people jump six foot in the air with mortified outrage at the attack on their their civil rights. what i wouldn't give for channel commander powers in the moderation role here. of course its all going to be different face to face because people by and large behave a lot better in physical proximity - but we are going to need solutions to this fiasco meaning form in the future."
"i'd highly recommend you stop blaming inanna for your actions. she did nothing wrong whatsoever. i know it's difficult for you to accept but you were (and are) completely out of line."
"everyone can read the logs. i'd stop insinuating that anyone other than yourself was the cause of the disruptions. you muted a csm member for the dire offense of disagreeing with you and calling you on your attempts to editorialize and change the results of votes. where you get off blaming everyone and everything else for this, or even insinuating that anyone else was doing anything untoward i don't know."
"would you care to explain exactly what you mean by \"editorialize\" and \"change results of votes\"?these are serious accusations, i'd like to know precisely what you mean?"
"\"obviously\"?? nope. let's look again at your original statement: in other words, you were referring to \"goon-trolling\" in the meeting as only that had an agenda and could reach an end. this thread has neither.and *again* you are being disrespectful to council members. an 'abstain' (which is, as i have noted, the vote i cast) *is* a meaningful vote, and that you choose to editorialise the decision i (and others on this and other motions) chose to make sadly shows you do not understand so seek to cast aspersions.oh dear, so a special rule for me whereas (i look at the logs) others, including yourself, will be free under your 'rule' to speak whenever they wish?clearly this thread has gone on long enough and others have made the points that needed to be made. that you are not answering the questions asked of you is ... a pity ... and that you seeking to place the blame elsewhere, just sad.iz"

"um... read the logs? inanna called you on it. hardin called you on it. i called you on it. inanna was then muted. it's been quoted multiple times in this thread and i'm sure you've read it...go ahead and play coy and offended though."
"the thing about text-based meetings is that it's pretty hard to actually interrupt proceedings - you don't silence somebody by typing over them, you just scroll the window faster. since i assume all the csm reps are sensible, and are sitting docked with the chat window essentially full-screened, scrolling is hardly a capital offense. it's not impossible, and a dedicated spammer can certainly ruin a window, but inanna was nowhere even close to that line. as for the csm bringing up rules on the topic, i don't think that would solve the problem. disruption is hardly something easy to set down in formal law - it will always require interpretation. you don't solve the problem of excessive moderation by laying down rules, you solve it by getting a chair who has some understanding of what their job is supposed to be. clearly, you're not it."
"i was asking to see if you actually understood the accusation you were making."
"you can be assured that all voting will be reflected the correct way in the minutes in the manner agreed upon before the vote. however jade phrased it afterwards is not relevant and was not agreed upon by the vote, and thus will be omitted.yes, there clearly were mistakes made during the discussion and voting itself. but they will be corrected. no need to start an argument about it here or during the discussion. please, act in a professional manner, we will all benefit from making this csm a success and the best way to work on that is stop this pointless fighting amongst ourselves."

"itt: 'jaded' getting new meaning."
"not condescending at all...i'm going to have to disagree - it's not pointless. for the council to function, you're going to need a good chair, and jade has proven that he's not it. strife sucks, but it's usually better than giving up on things that matter."
"you completely misunderstood what was going on there inanna. the electable chair vote ended with a 4/2/2 result and half the csm committee felt that meant it failed, half felt it passed. we moved to a secondary vote on the principle of majority voting (in general) to clarify whether the result was a pass or a fail. your behaviour makes a lot more sense now in retrospect if you actually did confuse these two issues and assumed it was a revote on issue 3 specifically."
"that isn't what i said. does that mean you are \"editorializing\" now?"
"thank you ankh, would be nice to see this from jade and why he thinks his non-relevant and confusing statements are helpful to the process."
"what's this? a representative was chosen because of their e-rep in the world of flames and straw-man debates? and you say it's going, not in circles, but in shattered half-moons of chaos, destruction and a waste of ccp's money? why i never!is anyone really surprised at this? it's jade."
"you are a terrible chairperson and should step down. you can't control the meetings and you are lashing out in extremis, making things even worse. do yourself, the csm and the community a favour and step down from the position. you have every right to represent those who voted for you but you are destroying this excellent chance for the community to get their views across more succinctly to ccp and actually have them acted upon."
"\"editorializing\" is not a difficult concept to grasp. are you seriously wondering whether darius is able to comprehend what it means?but hell, since you don't seem to understand this simple concept, i will explain it for you.it means that when the council voted to pass a measure that was defined in one specific way, you made a note that the measure passed defined in a different specific way. now, i will assume for the sake of courtesy that you are both literate and not a polemic dillweed(though it there is ample evidence for the contrary) and will present both the issue voted on and the issue you editorialized. precisely so that you can comprehend what is going on here (however dense, intentionally or otherwise, you would have to be to not understand)the vote: 1st issue is can the elected candidate return to a meeting and regain voting rights when the debate moves on to the next item on the agendathe editorializing: alternates can be removed from csm rep voting status at any time by a candidate arriving at the meeting(note: those are above quotes of the issue[italics are me for emphasis], and this happened twice where you made that same mistake, this quote being the second time after the official vote)do you just not care enough to read what you are voting on or is this a concentrated effort to subvert the will of the csm since they voted against you?"
"what was decided on this? does it require 5 or more \"yes\" votes to pass something, or just more \"yes\" votes than \"no\" votes? it's confusing to determine reading the log."
"they eventually reconsidered their first, self-negating vote at the end of the meeting, and decided that yes > no = pass. only took them three hours to come to a decision that should have taken ten seconds - thank you serenity, for the gifts you have brought us."
"jade has made some mistakes in this meeting. we are reviewing what happened, and will try to make sure it won't happen again next time. i'm pretty sure that what people call \"editorializing\" on those votes was not intentional. it got blown way out of proportion, and people reacted in an unprofessional manner.it was already a brewing mess in the chat, so i understand why jade wanted to stop the endless arguing and bickering and just get to the vote, hence ignoring a complaint that would probably be valid. if the debate was otherwise conducted orderly, i'm sure that the complaint would have been heard and addressed appropriately.as i've said before in the other thread, the mess cannot be attributed to just one person."
"so the measure failed to pass and then you attempted to get the two members who didn't vote to vote so that it might?you moved to a secondary vote? what the heck does that mean for people who don't reside in \"jade land\"and where was the movement for the \"secondary vote\" and where was the second on the movement for the \"secondary vote\" and where were all the other votes in the secondary vote that would have to be recast.no, you were badgering the people who didn't vote to vote. its a simple concept how hard is it to understand?"
"yes, now you get it! the logs of what you really said are contained elsewhere in this thread and that was merely an interpretive and not entirely inaccurate portayal of the events. i've wasted enough time on you for today and 4 hours yesterday. i'm not going through the logs again to point out what multiple people already have, including... 5 i think other csm reps?"
"while i would like to share this sentiment, jade has a long long history of doing this intentionally. as stated earlier, he was banned from the forums for just this sort of behaviour. having tried to have discussion with jade based on logic where he devolves into ad hominem attacks and strawman i can't in good conscious say that this was anything but intentional."
"i respectfully disagree... only one person muted anyone and editorialized votes to suit their own whims. that is the source of this mess. thusly this mess can be attributed to just one person."

"i have no idea of whether it was intentional or not. but i do assure you that in a rl meeting, intentional or not, he wouldn't be coming back. and that's only referring to the editorializing part.i attribute it in whole to the chair from what i've read in the logs. and that chair is jade."
"it wasn't jade constantine's fault that over half an hour of time was wasted on the first issue, before the voting even started, most of us dragged out the discussion. this is one of several things that affected the atmosphere in a bad way, and likely attributed to the mistakes further down the road. i was definately itchy after wasting so much time, and later on i was close to losing my temper when people were casting (in my opinion) uninformed votes demanding an absolute majority for votes to pass. my apologies for my behaviour there.secondly...i really don't want to get involved in this \"editorializing\" discussion, but i just read the chatlogs yet another time.if we compare hardin's formulation the two of jade, we'll clearly see differences, which i bolded:however, the item was phrased very differently on the agenda:from my perception, jade constantine saw this issue as black-and-white as \"either they can come arrive during a meeting and regain voting rights, or they are excluded from voting until next meeting\". the nuance of the timing in which they would regain the rights in the meeting was lost. this is understandable if we look at when exactly this particular aspect of the issue was mentioned:then, the debate went off in an other direction and other aspects of the issue were covered. it was not discussed at all for almost 15 minutes, when jade called the vote:upon which people attacked jade for leaving out the aforementioned detail.from my hopefully neutral perspective, this was not intentional and merely miscommunication. in the future, i humbly request of all of you to politely correct other council members when they make mistakes, instead of assuming the worst.last, i really want to thank all council members and alternates for their commitment in seeing the meeting through to the end, no matter how frustrating it was."
"itt many people who are way too caught up in meaningless minutiae of the rules. maybe they can combine with the mass of jade haters to prevent the csm from accomplishing anything!"
"yeah that does seem to be the undercurrent - don't worry though ulstan, we got a decent set of issues through regardless and if the csm votes in iceland to make an electable chair in the constitution i'll be happy to sit back and just promote good issues for the next 4 months of the term. i'm sure the next chair will enjoy herding these cats."
"[ 2008.06.08 18:33:16 ] inanna zuni > jade![ 2008.06.08 18:33:22 ] inanna zuni > please do not editorialize a decision[ 2008.06.08 18:33:27 ] jade constantine > please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin ?[ 2008.06.08 18:33:29 ] hardin > 2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reason[ 2008.06.08 18:33:42 ] jade constantine > @ inanna please stop interrupting[ 2008.06.08 18:33:56 ] inanna zuni > jade ... please chair \"neutralperhaps when correcting the chair, not only should \"please\" be used, but perhaps following \"with sugar on top\" as to not offend."
"as was stated directly in the meeting, and repeatedly otherwise and ignored selectively, there's nothing preventing the chair from stepping down so a new one can be elected right now. there's also no 'constitution'. don't let me get in the way of you framing your own reality however."
"i suppose you would have preferred sheep eh jade?"
"would you?"
"or you can always mute them, and then go on the forum and ask what was this 'editorializing' about and brush off any kind of observations about bias.paraphrasing:- \"you are not being neutral <due to editorializing>\"- \"this is an unnecessary discussion give the results of vote 1\"- \"ok\"- \"and the votes of vote 1 have already established that <editorialized>\"so apparently jade didn't give a damn about either neutrality or what this \"editorializing\" was. if he didn't know he was doing it, he could have asked after the first or second time he was pointed out."
"which is actually a good point. despite the choas at stages all proposed business got done. we may end up all hating each other on csm by the end of our time in iceland - but if a result is delivered for the players of eve it might well be worth it.i do wonder who will even want to stand enxt time though?"
"i think you hit the nail on the head there. details entering the topic during the discussion should be included in the re-stating of the issue at the time of the vote. perhaps by the person who brought up the issue to avoid confusion? in this case it might have helped if hardin had been asked to re-state the issue in his understanding prior to the vote, at least so that you're starting with the person who is sponsoring the issue and working from their definition of the vote."
"to be honest its the light at the end of the tunnel. if we do actually get these issues into useful discussion and help get some decent changes through it all becomes worthwhile. these horrible meetings do have a purpose. end of the day all the forum trolling and nonsense means nothing if we make a positive impact on the game."
"you mean the discussion you are avoiding having on the forums as required by the csm document? that discussion? the csm is not a place where you get to make your argument to ccp, its a place where a group of people can come together and judge and present the communities wishes, reservations, and needs to ccp so that they can better create a game that we play.but you actually have to have a place where wishes, reservations, and needs can be presented to you before that happens and all that takes is a little will on your part to get it done."
"he did, after which jade then summarized him in an incorrect and unflattering manner.it would not have been very different had there been a vote on \"re-examine 0.0 sovereignty\" and then at the end, darius johnson had said \"vote to **** over small alliances has passed\""
"the more i look at the whole brouhahah over the issue of abstained votes, the more i shake my head in dismay. that issue should have been dealt with in about 10s. abstaining votes don't count in any way whatsoever, that's why they're 'abstain' instead of 'yes' or 'no'. it just means \"i'm here but lets pretend i'm not for the purpose of this vote\"anyway hopefully that's all threshed out now and future meetings can deal with more weighty matters."
"i suggest the following things happen before the next meeting:1) every csm brushes up on parliamentary procedure2) a moderator with no voting powers is appointed to handle the appropriate procedural points of order"
"get into coattails irc, you knob."
"yeah truth is everybody in that meeting failed. on that point. i failed to just make a judgment call and say \"the votes count this way\"those in favour of the 5/9 decision (including bane who actually said he saw it written that way in the document) failed.those against the 5/9 decision failed to point out it was written otherwise in the docs. inanna failed to actually explain herself rather than arching criticizing lack of committee knowledge and delaying the processall nine of us failed and as a result all nine of us wasted more than an hour on a ridiculous sequence of discussions and accusations and hotblooded confrontations that have led to the fiasco here today. (then again i'd say a high proportion of the forum respondents on these numerous threads fail as well, because while they are frothing and snarling about this administrative stuff there are actually a number of real gamplay issues that have made the iceland agenda they'd be better served by talking about)."
"now it's everyone's fault... well at least that's a step in a direction."
"well darius i'm talking about a specific vote there. you played a part in that as well as i did. any of us could have actually read the docs and said \"actually it says clearly that simple majority voting is the rule\" - nobody did."
"i apologize. it was not obvious to me with my limited linguistic skills that you were talking about a specific vote and not the meeting in general."
"i'm not suprised to see that csm meetings aren't going as well as they could be. this comes from a flagrant disregard for the csm documents and the rules mentioned within it, and a misintepretation of what the meeting with ccp will actually be. it also comes from some csm member's assuming that they can just turn up for a quick meeting once a week and vote on some issues..your jobs, as csm members, is to discuss, in meetings, the issues that players are concerned about. those issues must be issues that affect the majority of the eve players, and they each must be posted in the forums for a period of no less than 7 days for player discussion etc. i pointed out that having 60+ issues as one agenda point was in disregard of this, but since it suited certain members to have it voted on as one issue, it was ignored. i see that you did not discuss each issue in the pdf as you said you would....the csm documents make it clear that each issue must be discussed by csm members (and it is expected that the 9 members will have differing views etc), then a simple nay or aye vote taken. since there are 9 of you, 5 votes in the 'aye' are required for an issue to be esculated. i see no mention of an abstain being allowed...but since you accepted it, that makes the 5 'ayes' harder to get, that is all. accept that all issues will not get esculated to ccp for comment!!!from the information, it is clear that you submit issues to ccp, they consider them and give their verdict in iceland and the other meetings. you formally present the issues (not the arguments) to them, they reply at the meeting. you can then present further arguments on why x issue is important. however, since many of the issues have had poor support, and you still esculated them without discussion, expect some pretty firm negative responses.all of the changing of the rules, inventing new ones to suit and solidify a position etc is plainly wrong. stop it please. you pollute the waters ahead for those csm members to come.if you can't stay for a 4 hour meeting, i question why you stood in the first place. you must have accepted that you may not actually be able to play much eve for 6 months! you are being flown to iceland, this shouldn't be something that only requires a couple of hours a week to gain. meetings should not have time limits...you need to discuss each issue, when you shove 75 on the agenda expect it to take 4 hours.arithron"
"would you please point me to where someone stated we were going to discuss them all?and would you please read the chat log. you will see that the topic was voted for, provided it was split into chunks, in order to ease discussion. as for the time issue. the first meeting was stopped due to the time limit was reached.this time around, we wasted too much time on nothing. some of us have stuff to do in real life, like exams or jobs. at least have respect for that, when you put it on a sunday or earlier on in the evening, so that those of us who lives in gmt+2, arent kept up till midnight.also, who are you to question why people stood in the first place(i'm sorry if i come out as angry or anything, but i see it as an insult)? i dont think you quite know what goes on behind the scenes.i personally haven't pvp'ed since the beginning of the election, as i dedicated large majority of my time to csm. and at present i spend about double the amount of time i'm actively ingame, to csm related work."
"jade -you viewed this thread - linkage - you then responded with a positive vote and mentioned you'd bring it up in the csm meeting. (note - this thread was authored immediately once the csm forum was active. the original thread is months old. the problem is years old.)however, i seen no mention of its discussion, or of it even being brought up."
"actually, if you remember right, i also stood ;)please don't take everything personally...i may not have been referring to you!meetings will go on beyond the expected time...get the chairman to put them at better times.i see that the 60+ issues being split up again will now require reposting for a period of seven days right? and all the other issues that weren't posted on the forums, such as abstaining from a vote, alternates etc...meaning that a representative cannot bring a topic up at a council meeting without having it go through deliberation on the public forumthis is an interesting part of the csm document that a couple of representatives need to read carefully.. (not you lv).csm representative conductany behavior or actions considered to be a material breach of the eula or tos by a csm r epresentative is grounds for immediate dismissal and permanent exclusion from all pending and future participation in the council. there are no exceptions, regardless of the infraction. representatives are not only expected to uphold the social contract that all society members are held accountable to,but should also set a behavior standard for everyone else to follow.anyway, i appreciate that you had other things to do than sit in a meeting (rl takes precedence always). thats what the alternates are for though. i know you are working hard behind the scenes and putting time into the csm...but then, thats what you stood and were elected to do!take care,arithron"
"i do apologise, i'll make sure its on there for next sunday and do my best to get it on the agenda okay?"
"no sweat. it happens. was just a friendly reminder!"
"i'd suggest it meets the criteria. if lavista can break them up as separate issues for vote, we'd be fine.[ 2008.06.08 19:18:34 ] jade constantine > okay[ 2008.06.08 19:18:42 ] lavista vista > i will split them up and have the documents ready in 24-48 hours[ 2008.06.08 19:18:44 ] inanna zuni > lavista ... i was explaining why i couldn't support the document en bloc[ 2008.06.08 19:18:48 ] jade constantine > i'm going to propose this to the vote on that provisonow, exactly what did you vote on here? did you vote that all these go to ccp, but be broken up into seperate issues first (hence making it appear that you had discussed all the issues (60+) and voted seperately on each one..or did you vote for the issues to be broken up and brought up at the meeting on thursday, where you will again discuss them and vote...and, my final question, did you bypass the rule requiring each issue to be posted on the forum, due to workload etc? it certainly appears you have...."
"are you saying that you think we shouldn't be able to support any of those issues in lavista's document unless he presents 60 individual issues arithron?i ask because we have a couple of other issues on the agenda that have several included - inanna has a ui issue that has multiple fixes, ank has a general fixes to the forum issue that has several issues there. hardin is going to be supporting an rp issue that has plenty of individual sub categories? let me get this straight. are you saying that in your opinion we are breaking the rules of the csm to vote these \"grouped\" issues onto the formal agenda for iceland?(and a secondary question) if we do break (change) the rules on this - what are you proposing to do about it?"
"i'm saying that having 60+ issues lumped in together stops discussion on each issue on the forums and in a csm meeting. i do not believe it was the intention for 60+ issues to be voted upon in one go by a single csm vote. there was very little discussion (in fact, you started voting before discussion...) on any of the issues before the vote. and, as you say, you should be able to support any of the issues that lavista proposes...and not support others that you disagree with. by having them all together, you deny this.all issues should be posted seperate on the forum for discussion, regardless of what they are or how interconnected. representatives can then choose to support each issue, or players can vote to support it.what i'll do about it is ask ccp to make a ruling on it. i'm suprised that you haven't done so already and reported it to the public.take care,bruce hansen"
"okay you would advise lavista to submit 60 submission docs and we'll confirm each one with a vote on thursday right?(same with inanna and her ui issues, ank with the forum issues and hardin with the rp issues?)you are welcome to right to ccp to make a ruling. i think you'll be a little disappointed at how forthcoming they are able to be at the current time with the patch tomorrow and timescale constraints however. don't assume we've been completely failing to ask ccp opinion on things. re lavista and inanna i'm going to ask them come and debate this issue with you first hand."
"i think he is saying \"do things properly so that the people have a chance to comment on each issue as required by the csm document\"that isn't an unreasonable onus."
"yes, lavista needs to write 60+ topics for the threads, and the other representatives also. that's the rules you were elected under, that's what you have to do. this gives players a chance to discuss/debate each issue and for the representatives to do likewise, both on the forums and in the meetings. it also allows for the important vote on each issue seperately.take care,bruce hansen"
"okay i've asked lavista and the other candidates with multiple item issues via our internal mailing list to come and respond to you specifically here arithron. i hope you'll either come to a rational compromise on the issue or i'll advise that they need to be split out. okay? give tomorrow for some discussion and i'll make a call in the evening."
"i don't need to come to a rational compromise: the csm representatives need to follow the clearly stated rules for posting issues.please note i have been rational through this entire discussion.i have highlighted above how circumventing this important procedure leads to a restriction or denial of discussion or rejection of issues (and the acceptance of issues, if there are a few good proposals lumped in with many bad ones).i'm looking forward to making contributions to many of the issues when they are posted seperately on the forum take care,bruce hansen"

"i feel it's unfair to relegate my issue with cynojammers and jumpbridges to serenity steele, a csm representative who has no concept of the problems involved in this issue. he advocated a form of concord in 0.0 space for god's sake."
"life is unfair. i emphasize with your plight i really do."

"those will be for the sunday following bane - to be announced. since they are 7 day issues that need to be formally voted. remember that as agreed yesterday you'll need to provide the fully-written submission template with each of those and if they get voted through. this thursday meeting is currently purely to confirm items for submission before the ccp deadline. + any crazy admin sack the chair / abolish moderation style procedural votes that people want to bring to filibuster the meeting with if they get bum-rushed into it by forum nonsense. anything after that / including the sunday issues we'll be submitting as a secondary group and asking ccp to make an exception on the 7 in advance rule if we have the time on the agenda. tl:dr version.i'll put those on the agenda for the sunday meeting, but you'll need to make sure each issue is fully documented with the ccp submission template."
"i would like to put the following items on the sunday agenda and take responsibility for getting the template worked up.completion of unfinished story arcs:"
"i believe these meetings are supposed to be scheduled in such a way that all may attend. 4pm east coast us time on a week day is typically during the work day. i'm going to ask that you reschedule for a time when all of the elected representatives can attend."
"i would concur with this, despite my uk base i have long experience of world-wide online meetings (and the innate difficulty in scheduling them) but when it is known that two of the csm are us-based then it is unreasonable to intentionally schedule a meeting they cannot be present at. the timezones the current 'csm 9' are in are, i believe, cdt, bst(gmt+1) and edt so there is a six hours gap. this is very clearly a problem on a weekday (due to school / college / work / etc), thus an actual 'meeting' might not be the right way to proceed (midnight european being 6pm east coast is the nearest to a possible time and is still very imperfect) so maybe a thread on the unused-so-far 'proclamations' forum is the right way to go here, with each council member posting their submission as a new thread and *csm members only* posting an acceptance of it. this has the side-benefit of getting all the current issues to be submitted in one clear place separate of the discussions still taking place on other topics so that all pilots can see what we are taking forward.iz"

"this seems like a rather weak blanket argument against anything that would be new and expensive. ie. i could see the same argument being used against supercapitals and the like. you're one of the few csm members that i respect and enjoy hearing about, so i hope you get back to this thread. my question for you is: why should older players be punished for the sake of younger players? i'm by no means an older player, but i would not object to the introduction of these more powerful implants."

"the express consent of those in the photo has been granted in this very thread that you just cleaned. you even left a post in the thread from the person in the photo thanking the person who posted it for doing so."

"my suggestion is to modify local chat so that it doesn't show who is in system. local chat is currently used as a tactical tool and i believe this hinders the atmosphere and game play potential of the game.this would make space much more exciting, potentially lead to more dynamic pvp opportunities and would encourage people to work together more and in new ways. it would make space feel like the giant ocean it is, not just a series of interconnected fishbowls.i believe that constellation chat should auto-update, rather than local chat. this way hostiles can still be located but not instantly pinpointed to a single system.i think this would be a balanced change for the better, as though it may benefit a potential attacker, it may also benefit someone who doesn't want to engage ie a miner or someone hauling. it would make fleets more reliant on intelligence from players rather than from a box full of names. discuss"
"modilfy this goon scum.good idea."
"while i could see this as an advantage in some cases it would be a major, major, disadvantage in my case.changing local like is proposed would undoubtedly further the bias toward really big corporations and alliances even more. it would also make it even harder to do anything by yourself outside of high-sec.as it is right now, it is simply stupid to rat more than one or two jumps from your buddies, and that is with instant knowledge of who is in system.if you don't know who is in system at any time then you had better be in a gang of some size if you want to even rat(unless you have a death wish).without an actively updated local roaming gangs would make 0.0 life even harder than it is now. almost, nobody willingly engages unless they have an advantage, changing local would only force more people to fight and die when they would have rather run."

"op should modify the thread title from \"player banning\" a rather general and obscure, until one reads the contents, to \"unban **********\" - that way we will all know what is going on....as far as i understand, ccp has a full authority to pretty much do anything they want in the game world and on forums. all our stuff belongs to them.... that said, i do not know what exactly happened, even after reading all the information on his forums - i am not certain how he obtained the db that implicated certain characters in the now-well-established passed scandal. if he obtained the information legally, or as legally as one can, then i would certainly not mind csm taking a closer look at the ********** affair - however, if the information has been obtained via a hack, or other illegal means, then i would not be able to support it at all - even though i am am avid reader of his forums. other than that, i am just bumping this thread to see what happens - and if csm would ask some questions and perhaps prepare a report without too many details on what ccp told them was the reason for banning. was it a retaliation for outing some well known characters, was it for illegal actions that lead to the outing that can be proven by ccp? what was it - the affair is well know and widely publicized, a small inquiry would be in order - but i can not support to just \"unabn\" the guy, need more info.edit:could someone point me in the direction, specific direction that shows where the version of the db was obtained/how it was obtained? or drop me an eve-mail with the info? until then a simple \"unban\" does not work for me. worthy of an investigation by csm, perhaps, but not just lifting the ban."
"this man did all of eve a service, and got banned for his trouble.not because he broke the rules. because he made ccp look stupid.free **********!"
"unban!"
"- i want to live. i want a home, and children, and peace.- do ya?- aye, i do. i've asked god for these things. it's all for nothing if you don't have freedom."
"revealing the truth behind a scandal is not a reason to ban someone."
"right the wrongs of the ban."
"i support this. unban him. if he wouldn't have spoken then we would still have dev's that cheat in the game we pay.he should've been awarded but not with the ban stick."
"yep i thought this aswell, supported."
"supporting this."
"supporting this."
"this should have been done ages ago...shame on ccp for shooting the messenger"
"afaik: - he didn't hack the rkk forums to get the db dump. he convinced some admin that he was someone else and was given the dump willingly.- he went to ccp first with the whole t20 deal and gave them a chance to deal with it, once they did nothing then he went public.- after the whole thing broke, ccp asked him to take down kugu.com while they investigated, and he did. ccp then banned him, and he brought it back."
"at this time i'd just like to know more about ccp's motivation."
"as would i, but this is something where everyone's hands are tied. no matter how unjust it might or might not have seemed to us in any individual case, ccp has the legitimate authority to ban players. and, they can't comment on how the investigation, or the specifics of what happened, because of issues of privacy and confidentiality. we the rest of the players are not privy to all the facts, and it's not appropriate for us to be.csm can certainly ask ccp, more generally, how it conducts investigations and the steps it takes in deciding when to ban a player, but asking ccp to unban a player isn't csm's job.sorry, no support.------------------------lord, grant us the senility to forget the people we never liked anyway, the good fortune to run into the people we do, and the eyesight to know the difference."
"free **********, this happened just as i started playing eve and i cant believe its still not sorted."

"give everyone +10 in all attributesleave basic learning skill alonerefund sp spent in learning skills by doubling training speed until you gain back twice the amount of sp you lost. remove the 800k sp character builds and revert them to before they were introduced. newbies need to spend more time in frigates, and less time on learning skills."
"if learning skills are removed, i expect to be reimbursed on the full sp i spent on the learning block and be allowed to put it where i please. i didn't spend months on that block to be screwed later on.regards, maabuss"
"learning skills should be done away with and skill training time should be re-ballanced once they are gone. ccp might even give us our skill points back."
"you're hardly acting as if you care what anyone else thinks, as you've repeatedly said that you'll act the same way in the future.and darius does a hell of a better job of rolling with the punches when he gets trolled. i hope you understand it's rather unprofessional to troll back. you're taking this way too seriously.i voted in favor of it.so a method exists already. but you want ccp to be the only ones to initiate a vote of no confidence? considering all the support they've given to the csm this far, i'm not at all pleased with that option."
"oh i can support in this topic too.impeach it."
"hey guys lets elect a council but if they try to have a discussion and disagree with me lets mute them for being disruptive! democracy in action!"
"oh wait i'm a goon and obviously because of that i can't have an opinion on this matter because its a goon conspiracy to ruin eve."
"not true, i care about what some people think. i just don't happen to care what abusive trolling people think. and yep, while i have admitted some mistakes in that meeting i don't believe muting inanna was one of them and i stand by that decision. if you want vote to \"impeach the chair\" because you hate the concept of committee moderation then go you. but don't feel too bad if i mostly ignore your arguments on the matter as irrelevant claptrap while i get back to considering the merits of gameplay issues on this forum section right?"
"there you have it, straight from the horses mouth. if you disagree with jade and vote opposite to what it wants, you're an abusive troll and don't deserve a voice.oh wait i'm a terrible goonie and my opinion doesn't matter."
"so what would you say to the csm charter which clearly states it's a council of equals, but yet you take it upon yourself to make it unequal (in your favor)?this isn't a fascist dictatorship that because you got 40 odd more votes than hardin you get to rule with an iron fist. it's guess what... a council! where... guess what? you all get to vote equally! no wai, are you sure it says that in the charter? *mutes the charter*"
"i support this vote of no-confidence.the last meeting was pathetic."
"so if a member from the player base speaks up in disagreement with you, and replies to your condescending remarks in kind, that player is labeled a troll. so is this your solution for a mute towards your player base that you are supposed to be working for?"
"channel mute it and let the csms have an opinion. just because it got the most votes in the initial election doesn't mean it gets final say in any and every topic brought to the table."
"everyone is equal but some are more equal than others."
"i check my own prostate all the time. what's the problem?"
"no. the council is not the same as a government. they do not have to be in charge of things like this. honestly i think that the csm document should be greatly expanded to include some sort of procedure for discussion, debate and decission makeing. with the time constraints that this council is under, i am supprised that they have gotten through as many real issues as they have. well done everyone. however the problems with this council are due to a lack of clear procedure. they do not have time to create one from scratch before they goto iceland and still have quality things to put on the table there for discussion. this is why someone got muted. this is why darius farted. this council has been asked to decide together what meaningfull topics will go to iceland for discussion with little to no procedure. as far as a vote of no confidence...have the csm document changed to state that if a majority of the csm reps feel the chairman should be removed, they can take the issue to ccp who will look into the matter and make a decision. (oh and use a clear deffinition of majority)the csm does not belong to us. it belongs to ccp. this is their tool to get usefull feedback from their players, let them make it work."
"does moderation really include quelching votes and disregarding vote results you don't like?"
"seeing the log. seeing jade comin here and act 12. i wish i had voted for another. dunno maybe his dad wrote up his little spiel that made me vote for him.im not a goon or a goon alt. he dont know me from adam. i want him off the chair before he has another \"malfunction with the channel\" when its time to vote for a important issue.also who come to the chair i would hope would know what it is tobe a chair and not make there little wise*****s after every vote.and jane growup. ya want to play big boy then play it.i vote to have him removed from the chair and if he cant settle down and work for me twards my goals in the game. i want him out of the csm and put somone who can do the job with out being a burden to the system."
"i agree with what you said. and yes i voted for him also. however i do not agree to remove him from the csm completely. he has a lot to contribute. but just not from the chair."
"so you're going to just ignore us, blow us off, and the thread that has been created because of you, yourself, jade constantine? it's becoming increasingly evident that you don't care about us just because we didn't vote for you. if you keep up that attitude, you may not get another term.the only problem with this is that there's been very little feedback from ccp. xhagen may have been in the first official meeting, but he didn't really do anything. they haven't even published the minutes from the first three meetings yet. i think it's partially their fault, too, that jade has taken it upon himself to enforce the meetings as he sees fit."
"ccp just helping the goons destroy the game faster"
"no you misunderstand. i don't care about silly forum trolls with nothing better to do than post exactly the same thing 10101001301003 other forum trolls are posting. its got nothing to do with people not voting for me. i can respect a difference of opinion, what i can't respect is repetitious mediocrity. i find collectivist activity very yawn-inspiring at the best of times. well technically i've taken it onto myself to run the meetings as advised in the csm documentation. where things have gone wrong have been where i've made the mistake of allowing this council a little too much democracy and allowed them to impact the constitution of the csm itself. inevitably it led to problems as people try to vote themselves advantage. case in point was the vote on moderation and op powers. what i should have done was rule it out of order and simply say \"the docs say the chair moderates live with it or complain to ccp\". instead we wasted time on a vote to confirm a power the officers have anyway just to placate the butt-hurt feelings of some guys that don't like being told when they can speak in meetings. thats the truth of it."
"yes because it is clearly in ccp's interest to help destroy their own game and primary corporate income."
"why does jade keep dismissively referring to \"your csm reps\"? it was pointed out by darius earlier: jade, in case you weren't aware, you are our csm rep. you didn't vote for yourself 2,436 times, and it's entirely possible that one of those people who voted for you disagrees with your recent actions. take responsibility for your actions, and stop opposing both your constituent base and your fellow csm members."
"lol one thing you are going to have to realize about me is i treat people differently depending on my past experience with them. you've acted like a complete plonker from your first posts so i honestly don't care what you think anton, sorry but i got elected for my disarming honesty as much as anything herschel yamamoto on the other hand even though i disagree with him over the issue of muting inanna, i do care what he thinks because he's taken time to read and present issues here, take an interest in the csm process and generally be a responsible respondent to issues threads. so don't try and sun yourself in my conciliatory post to another person. its really not meant for you!"
"no support. let them work it out.i think its very important that the csm learns to leave their baggage at the council room door and works together, almost as important as the end product they're working towards. future councils need a precedent set that you don't just move to impeach whenever someone does something stupid/unpopular.start the culture of cooperation now. those who don't buy-in just look silly and short sighted. next election day, make cooperation a voting issue."
"you've obviously realized that flat denial and self-delusion isn't working, so you're attempting distraction and appeasement, is the point.ironically, when you insulted all those who criticized you (zomg we want to see csm fail and its all a big goon conspiracy), you insulted the people whose ***es you are now attempting to kiss. good luck, jade, if they're stupid enough to be 'disarmed' by your facade more power to them."
"you're hardly acting as if you care what anyone else thinks, as you've repeatedly said that you'll act the same way in the future.and darius does a hell of a better job of rolling with the punches when he gets trolled. i hope you understand it's rather unprofessional to troll back. you're taking this way too seriously."
"vote against. jade acted appropriately in muting innana, who was clearly in the wrong and disruptive to the meeting. furthermore, innana has acted even less professionally since the meeting, and is now making wild accusations on these boards instead of working with the council to get past the issue.if anyone should be removed, it's innana."
"no i don't think innana should be removed at all (i am of the opinion that people should only be removed for gross misconduct, such as breach of the nda, or at the end of thier term nothing else) i do however agree that she should take it up with the members of the csm to try and come to some sort of way of getting past the issue beween themsleves rather than bringing it into the public domain."
"nobody wants anybody removed from the csm. some people just feel that the position of chair would be better filled by someone other than jade."
"where's my support thumb.wait there it is. seriously, jade, you're easily the biggest idiot i've ever seen elected to office, and i live in america."
"jade is going great. inanna was disruptive and deserved the 30 second? mute, lol. wahh waahh the csm chairman isn't nice to me when i criticize him, seriously shutup."
"you are ignorant of the facts, my dear forum alt. ianna was kicked from the chatroom and then unable to join until after a vote had concluded."
"doesn't jade write terrible fanfic about unrestrained gallente sexuality? someone find that link... that's clearly not the direction i want this game going."
"yeah, i've read the chatlogs and i do agree that jade seems to be not only abusing it's power as chair, but seems to be paranoid. i vote that jade is removed from chair position at the very least. at the most it should be removed from the council altogether if it's obvious mental instability becomes an issue."
"well actually the sanction against inanna was a 30 sec mute. but sadly the chat channel functionality is messed up and the un-mute setting = kick from channel. she then needed to be manually re-invited and un-muted again. but the point is the punishment was a 30 sec mute while the final vote of the evening was being stated. its entirely false for you to state that she wasn't able to join against till after the vote - she was given an opportunity to cast her vote when she'd rejoined. if anyone is ignorant of the facts (albeit intentionally so) its you anton."
"good even better. if hes diruptive again he should be banned for a month."
"] hardin > hang on where is inannashe was able to vote...after she resolved the problem and returned, minutes after the vote had been called by you, jade."
"innana's vote would have been useless either way. i hope he's learned not to disrupt the process next time."
"guys we should have a fair election for who should be csm chair.*mutes everyone not in gs*"
"sadly, based on all evidence i can see it's clear that jade is unable to remain within his remit, and therefore i support this."
"i have to admit, it's pretty funny how much of a giant joke the entire csm is."
". in most of that time i had not been able to *see* the discussion, let alone vote at any point, thus is quite ridiculous as i didn't even know what the vote was about having been kicked and re-entered twice then kicked an unable to re-enter! yes, it was subsequently suggested that there is something odd about that channel's controls (unique, indeed; i haven't been able to replicate it on any other channel) so maybe some of that was unintentional, but it doesn't change the sequence of events into that you repeatedly suggest.iz"
"its hardly a joke. the ridiculous fascination with it is though."
"who didn't see this coming.boot the loon."
"seeing the log. seeing jade comin here and act 12. i wish i had voted for another. dunno maybe his dad wrote up his little spiel that made me vote for him. im not a goon or a goon alt. he dont know me from adam. i want him off the chair before he has another \"malfunction with the channel\" when its time to vote for a important issue. also who come to the chair i would hope would know what it is tobe a chair and not make there little wisecracks after every vote. and jane growup. ya want to play big boy then play it. i vote to have him removed from the chair and if he cant settle down and work for me twards my goals in the game. i want him out of the csm and put somone who can do the job with out being a burden to the system."
"see what?, bitter whiners not getting what they want and so looking for a witch to burn cos they cannot deal with their own in game inadequates and incompetence.yup id say anybody with a brain saw this coming a mile off although i am sure ccp are very happy the cry-babies now have somebody else to blame and pester."
"nolet jade do his job.a complete democracy with no one in power, using said power to keep the csm in order, will fail to accomplish anything then a comedy circus. i'm sure some would like it to fail this way."
"i had a pretty decent reply but \"bitter whiner not getting what they wants and so looking for a witch to burn cos they cannot deal with their own in game inadequates and incompetence\" pretty much describes jade perfectly. except for the bad grammer of it all."
"actually i was referring to you and the other drama queens on here spouting your crap, but i am more than happy to include jade and the rest of the useless csm clowns as well."
"what is his job? to boot and mute anyone who doesn't agree with him? to make the other council members lives a living hell? to claim powers that he has no right to? if that's his job then sure he does it quite well.why even have anyone else on the council if you want it to be a dictatorship?"
"you completely missed the point of this and several other entire threads. if jade were acting like a moderator and not a tyrant (read robert's rules of order if you need to have what that means defined), we wouldn't be having this discussion. jade has taken every opportunity to usurp power and control for himself, up to and including silencing people with dissenting opinions who are just as passionate about their job as csm as him.he's got a christ complex and he's working himself up to be the martyr. i'm happy to give him that status if it means he's out of the chairman's position. you could put anyone else in that position and i'd be fine with it. the rest of the csms have displayed at least a passing respect for what 'council of equals' means."
"whilst you are certainly welcome to your opinions (and if everyone thought exactly the same the world of eve or 'real life' would be very boring) please point me at any evidence for these claims. \"wild accusations\"? hardly ...izps. i do not presently support the removal of jade from the position of chair of the csm. obviously, being a rational human being, this opinion is subject to change in the light of future events."
"i think most people respect that. if you did support our position it could easily be spun by jade's flunkies to make you look petty. you're an intelligent person so i'm sure you already know that, though."
"qft ;)so is jade a \"he\" or a \"she\"? decide please. ;)i knew this crap was going to happen. and i bet it's going to happen again and again, even if someone new is elected. i wish there was a way to do psychological screening before electing candidates.i say we give jade a chance to \"get his/her s*it together...\" sort to speak. people make mistakes, and sometimes they need to learn how to handle themselves in a new role. let's just see how it plays out. i'll always have a chance to give my thumbs up later, if nothing will change.ps: teh goons need to \"hush\". seriously. the way people conduct themselves in a game often shows what kind of people they are in rl. at least to a certain level. to be complaining about someone else's conduct, you must 1st show \"good\" conduct yourself. (just my two cents)"
"i refuse to take the responsibility of making such a decision."
"so when a person is throwing around their power and abusing you just roll over like a good little slave and take it?"
"don't worry about me, my desktop pc runs on goon tears"
"its all downhill from here, i'm afraid. hence my proposal to nip the jc problem in the bud.jade is also trying to assert veto power, which the chair clearly doesn't have."
"so you want to mute people who don't disagree with you, too.i don't get why everyone thinks we're terrible people just because of our in-game reputation. why are we powerful enough to get two individuals onto the csm? why do we control so much space? what makes us so much worse than the other griefers? i'll take your stereotyping into account and reiterate what you had to say: \"to be complaining about someone else's conduct, you must 1st show 'good' conduct yourself.\""

"i support this idea.i don't mind if they're not searchable but i would like to browse them without mucking about with contracts."
"but there is the problem, it becomes increasingly difficult for an attacker to have any ability to get their caps into system to counter your caps. they have to send in bs fleets in order to shoot a cynojammer module with about a million hp, while under possible fire from enemy capitals, supercaps, and by extension dd's with no oppertunity to get their own cap support into the system to allow the support fleet to work. essentially to fix you're problem you can lower the cynojammers onlining/offlineing timers. but if you want to move caps freely around your systems you should leave the cynojammers offline, and online them if the system is under threat. if you take capitals out of the picture, the defenders already have an advantage. they don't need an overwhelming advantage such that you have to be a megablob to attack it. anyway the best proposal is to make the jump bridges into jump gates, and allow any ship that can use system gates be able to use jump gates, but any ship that cannot use jump gates will have to cyno to a pos cyno module (you know those modules actually exist right? and are disabled by cyno jammers)."
"good ideas."
"i'll agree with this but...i feel in many ways the whole eve online universe needs a complete fiction reboot, not unlike what they do with comic books every now again. and this new fiction must be integrated fully into the game and game play, because is someways, eve online feels like a game looking for a story."
"seems to me if there was a substantial vote of approval from non-rp segment of the community was for this ... you'd get my approval ...since someone within the rp community is rallying the troops .. bravo .. but there are more important stuff ie game mechanics issues ... please stand in line ...no approval"
"i approve of anything that says, \"ccp update your website and finish what you've started.\""
"it would make large fleet fights take hours to complete. it would, without a doubt, make large fleet fights even worse. it only works in your imagination."
"i always expected some crazy requests, but you sir, take the cake.two people have a gun, they shoot one person, that one person should only take the damage of one gun if they're the same size or larger?wow, i know we have to suspend disbelief a bit and ignore physics, but this is ridiculous."
"why don't they just make invention dual tiered. the current system for makeing bpcs of of t2 gear. and a way more expencive like 100-1000x more data cores and some other new stuff and invention based skills at lvl 5's in the same things you need now. and it will transfer t1 bpos to t2. gives poeple a reason to get those high lvl r&d agents. it will remove alot of t1 bpos as they get transfered to t2. it would still take quite a bit of time for new players to get these skills and rp. but it would give some poeple another goal. it doesn't seam like this would be unfair to anyone really, this game is skill and isk based. and it will feed both really."
"i would only be satisfied if my bpos were turned into bpc equal to 3 years worth of production.actually i'd only be satisfied if dev's actually commented on the issue instead of hiding from it.the last peep of info was ages ago at the last fanfest (a reply of 'no they won't be changed') but there really is too much time between actually dev comments.its a constant gamble investing in assets than can be nurfed becuase of a forum of majority whiners."
"i move that all threads suggesting the removal of any of the csm reps be taken with a grain of salt. theese people were elected to do a job. it is a job that you all want them to do. ccp has given them an enormous challange and they are sucseeding. the majority of the work of the csm has run very smoothly and every problem that has occured has come in the form of commitee procedure. they have not been given time to work out procedure but they are doing it as well as they can and have come to some decisions. as for the goons, it seems obvious that they, like any other group, are a group of individuals. while some goons may attempt to harass or troll or greif, that does not say anything about other goons. an individual may not be judged by any other member of a group to whitch they belong. they must be judged by their own merrit. well done csm."
"ccp introduced roles for seven people. if 7 people can't get along without one being called chairman they certainly can't get along with one being called chairman. what makes it worse that the person with that title takes it to mean they have more say and more power than the rest of the group which is not true.ccp screwed them from the beginning. i feel sorry for the csm reps. council of equals. not a dictatorship where one rules over them all.wish i could give this a thumbs down :("
"put a group together without a well defined structure and the individual with a more dominant/strong personality will always rise among them to take control, its the natural and normal progression of things no matter if you like it or not.making a set of well defined rules will prevent things from getting out of hand in the future but complaining about it is a waste of breath."
"support. i've actually got no confidence in the people that make \"no confidence\" threads. i think they're rubbish."
"absolutely. these should be the starting point for working out rules that work for the csm, not a blank sheet of paper.full suport."
"i like roberts rules of order and all but honestly, it won't fix any of the issues.it's kinda like the motion to end discussion, if everyone just shut up discussion would close by itself. the current csm board has unofficial decided(maybe official, horrible minutes are horrible) that they discussion will happen on the forums. the meetings will be pretty much straight up voting.only thing i wish they had a clear list of motion they can do. right now, it's pretty much a cluster**** on what csm can do. thus some of their logic is horrible."
"the csm exists to present issues to ccp. that's all the authority ccp has given them. i guess what you're saying is that since there's no way we can get five percent of the voting population to vote on a single topic that it's up to the individual csms to push their pet issues. i can understand why you'd need to debate amongst each other in an environment like that."
"ah well quite. in the case of a 5% supported issue then the csm has no business debating wether or not to bring it to ccp as it is mandated in the csm document that this issue must be bought before the ccp council by the csm however there still in that case is issues of how to present it and the wording of such an important presentation would also be discussed."
"broadly speaking, i think you're right. lacking the 5%, in order to make it to ccp an issue has to pass a vote of csm. only one member of csm needs to be in favor for it to be brought to a vote at csm, though; the members of csm have a legitimate right to convince each other which way to vote on particular issues (unless every member makes up their minds just by reading the forum posts, which would be nice but seems unlikely). as much as we might wish otherwise, debate is probably unavoidable.i won't say you're wrong, because you're right, but i'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this is actually harder than it looks.(still supporting my own topic)"
"i was swaying for the proposal, until i saw this.that statement alone is enough to illustrate what should happen: even if the csm members can bring things to the table, the forum thread should be used as the 'paper' for the item. simple as that. it should present all the facts, and the facts should sway the readers. in fact, even easier than a real meeting, the other csm members can see the discussion going on, and there may be little gems in that discussion that no-one has thought about.edit: however, there does need to be some structure to the debate. i'd rather see this move to irc, where the standard +v (voice) can be applied to only one member at a time to raise a point. this then streamlines the discussion and the minutes, as they can be copied almost verbatim. it also allows people to present their entire point without interruption. again, that is in the extremely few cases there will be discussion, and that discussion must only be limited to events pertaining to the csm only, otherwise the debate should be opened up to everyone. some of the other standard rules of debating could be included, but not for the purpose of debating."
"why the hell don't you just ignore the crap threads and focus on things that matter? over the course of your term there's going to be so much **** floating around that you'll spend most of your time 'commenting' on those posts. easy answer is: don't."
"i take it you don't watch pvp videos. most of them are small gang pvp vids and we accomplish a whole lot.."
"your stupidity offends me."
"stupid is as stupid does"
"this post intentionally left blank."
"this brings a tear to my eye. i've been banned from the forums for 15 days, and when i finally return, my original post is still on the main page.thanks, everyone!"
"i don't believe that they are that unfair to be honest as the communications from ccp in regards to what was asked of them to do by the csm were all along the lines of \"soon\" which is hardly the mark of an organisation going out of it's way to help things along. unfortuntly some of these matters needed asking as there were no guidelines. but yes it certainly shouldn't be the csm who is doing this. agreed here's hoping that the response given is better than the responses given so far."
"you actually. you've stalked these forums for the last three weeks like some kind of morbid vulture picking holes and singing songs of doom and gloom and anytime anybody actually tries to engage with you they get more carping criticism and nit-picking leaving the poor respondent wondering they bothered in the first place. i've tried to explain the situation to you but you still insist on trying to blame and whine and complain about whats been done over the course of three weeks of frenetic struggle to get this show on the road. at this stage arithron though i'm deeply tempted to tell you where to get off i'm still going to advise my fellow csm reps to try and reach middle ground with you on these multi-item issues, but i'm going ask you in turn to shelve the pettifoggery for long enough to see we are actually trying to work with you here and do the best we can do. but if you can't do that well, nobody can say i didn't try."
"why is it always somebody else's fault, jade?"
"bears repeating. can't believe you're on your high horse here, darius. sort your own act out before throwing stones please. frankly though, the blame lies at the feet of all the csm reps for the problems in this meeting. i think it also bears repeating that things were achieved in this meeting, despite the difficulties. that actually augurs well for the csm. things can improve, certainly. i'm confident they will. but that things were still done in these, the most trying of times, suggests that when things sort themselves out, the csm will get a great deal done, and may just turn out to be a vehicle for positive change. i realise drama is the lifeblood of eve, but try and keep some perspective people."
"why do you feel the need to troll every thread this evening? its one of those perennial questions of the human condition isn't it?"
"are we back to trolls and goon conspiracy?"
"to be fair i think conspiracy is pushing it just a tad too far when you look at your posting history today. almost all of it is abrasive comments aimed at jade with no actual content other than that designed to annoy people. so yeah i think the troll words fits in pretty well here. post somethign constructive with even a hint of middle ground and you might find people more willing to give your words some credence."
"it is clear that ccp did not hand you a constitution by which you are intended to funciton, and that is most likely intentional, merely some suggestions/guidelines. just look at the game and how it is played, you are the first set of elected representatives. it is your job to serve as the \"founding fathers\" and write the constitution.if you did that, worked together and wrote the basic outline of the constitution, selected your rules of operating procedure yourselves and followed it -- and when you met with ccp insisted that they recognise your player designed constitution formed by player elected representatives, they would really have no choice but to recognise it (outside of course, the actions of one 'government' (ccp) choosing not to recognise another government (the csm) just as happens in \"real world politics\" (mainland china throwing their weight around to discourage, for example, the usa to not recognise the government of tiwan officially)).i'd like to add that up until i read this thread i was on a trial account, and for some madhouse reason this actually made me want to activate my account. you have a huge opportunity here to form a player goverment in a very very political game. in all honesty, there is no reason this could not have been done before entirely on the will of the players alone without ccp saying you could do it (with of course the dubious question looming about voting/vote validity, but thats really no different than any \"real world\" government)."
"welcome to eve, dippin."
"i thought so too, let jade know.if reality annoys you.i believe removing jade from chair is constructive. i believe it is to the benefit of csm and many people agree with me. furthermore, plenty of people are willing to give my words credence, jade simply doesn't because my position is different from his, fortunately he is in no position to mute me."
"oh it doesn't annoy me in the least actually it is just the intention i was looking at. hmm getting people to agree to what they already agree to isn't a trick. getting people to listen to what you say and alter their opinion or at least make them think is rather the point and i don't think that you've really done that with the way you have gone about it today which was more my point. you are assuing jade of simply not lending weight to your words becuase he disagrees but you have been doin the same all day since hat thread came into being. in anycase i hope tomorrow brings about a few more cooler heads and a few less tantrums on these forums (not that i am holding my breath on that one ;) )"
"i don't wish to change people's minds or alter their opinions. i don't have an agenda like yourself. plenty of people came to the realization that jade is out of control on their own. people can, and should, make up their own minds.either that or he really believes the goon conspiracy tripe in which case he is mentally ill."
"well i believe that removing you from your ship and podding you repeatedly until your clone had so few skillpoints you couldn't reliably speak caldari without a phrasebook would be constructive too but we can't have everything we want. i guess we both need to get used to living with disappointment."
"you've already shown that you love no less than punishing those who disagree with you. i appreciate the fodder, however."
"no offense but i am unsure of your reason for posting then. do you simply wish to see your words on the forums? surely the whole point of the forums is to encourage deabte and discussion which is obviously partly about altering people's opinions to an extent. as for you not having an agenda well it's quite clear you do as you posted an issue thread for such an item ;) i certainly do have an agenda. i wish the csm to work. i believe ccp is at fault in the main for the problems with the csm and i think flaming jade continutally doesn't help to make things better. of course being in star fraction, i know jade personally and don't like to see him insulted and called things that are untrue but i will live with it as he will. as for being out of control i think half the problem as stated by cosmo on another thread somewhere is that people don't seem to realise how much control a chairman should be exerting on a commitee. that is of course nobodies fault as not many people have experience on serving as a chairman of a commitee. in any case the chairman's control or lack thereof is still a matter that should have been address by ccp in a properly prepared document rather than left to the first commitee to figure out for themselves. i realise many people don't like restrictive rules and in most things neither do i but a commitee without a solid structure and control by a chairperson does not work and i would rather like to see this particualr commitee succeed. /me goes to bed before he has to be up again."
"that was probably the least threatening threat and the wussiest burn in the history of eve online."
"that makes two of us.if quoting jade and, ironically, editorializing said quotes is \"flaming\".when you appeal to authority make sure its not someone who \"knows jade personally and don't like to see him insulted.\"the chairperson is responsible to the playerbase, not just ccp, as are all csm reps. the point of the majority of my \"insulting\" posts was to explain why i and others take issue with jade's actions during the meeting and since. perhaps you should try reading them again as you missed the point. in fact, the majority of criticisms directed toward jade aren't about the rules, or lack there of, but rather his own actions during the meeting and after."
"\"you mildly irritate me and your presence in a local channel that includes me may cause me to frown a bit\" how's that? i really should work on my threats. i knew there was a reason i didn't become a pirate ;)/me really is going to bed now."
"thumbs up"
"bull. you will see people give a middle ground when there is a middle ground to give. when jade lies and refuses to acknowledge the facts of the case he will get called on it. if you are complaining that he is called on it then maybe you should talk to jade about his habitual lying, ad hominem, strawman, and ignoring of all points which might damage whatever it is he supports.we are long past the point where we can present new evidence and arguments. we have presented them in spades and all that has been done is for jade to ignore them, lie about them, ad hominem them, and strawman them."
"this basically sums it up at this point. i never thought i'd be on goum's side of an argument but there it is."
"dearest goum,when are you going to get around to lengthy and irate derision of darius for the part he clearly played in this mess?i mean, if you're calling people on their behavior in some apparently non-partisan way and holding them to account for their actions, i assume that's on your agenda also?"
"darius muted ianna, editorialized csm decisions, then flipped out and said that those criticizing him were part of some conspiracy to destroy the csm rather than accepting responsibility?please."
"dear me. i'm pointing out what appears to be double standards, when goonswarm members lambast jade whilst silently letting darius off the hook for the part he played in this mess. your counter to this observation is to continue that very behavior? yeah, well played."
"what part? you have access to the log. lets see some quotes. although you may wish to start your own thread as this one is clearly about jade's actions (read the title of the thread).darius played no bigger part than any of the other csm reps, save jade. anti-goon bias is fun, but we've got real issues here."
"you've been doing some selective reading if you don't know what i'm talking about. if you want to see the quotes, then someone in one of these threads compiled a list of them where he was pretty clearly \"instigating\". rather than address the problem, however, goonswarm member/s just dismissed the person as an sf alt. that's the very same treatment goum here is complaining to jade about. you going to admonish your own people for acting in a way you've complained to jade about, goum? or is this just a case of double standards?when i raise the issue myself, it's dismissed once more and labelled \"not a real issue\" and \"anti-goon bias\". again, more double standards here or what? i think i'll leave it there, you seemingly don't have the capacity to meet the issue, and i wasn't even addressing you in the first place. i'll let the man speak for himself."
"darius's comments have always been towards the actions that the chair has taken to expand its power outside the scope of the csm document. are you are saying that it is right and proper to sit by and let the chairman expand its power so that it can push through partisan agendas? i suppose the meeting would have gone smoother had no one objected to jades usurpation of power and corruption of the position of chairman by using it as a bludgeon to get what he wanted. but i doubt that the outcome of the process would have been better."
"this entire csm is like a puppet show with jade dancing around and darius carefully pulling his strings. it really is quiet amusing. especially when you get to hear about the emails."
"i love it. welcome to eve dippin!"
"way to swallow the cool-aid.goons and darius in specific are transparent as air on this forum.mr. johnson was playing the righteous instigator from the start and especially at the tail end of that meeting.how many times did he bait jade near the end? three times at least. the double standards applied in this thread could win a trophy."
"\"3\"???? even you cannot ignore that you only twice purported to silence me when i asked a question, surely? and please do not say it was to \"protect\" a vote when none were in progress. really ...iz"
"sidebarthis is actually the very best reason why, no matter that it was very imperfect (especially used in a single-channel format) that a text-chat channel is the best option for meetings; voice recordings suffer from noise, lack of random access, lack of timestamps that all have equal access to, etc.iz"
"i am sorry i must have missed that, can you please point out these baits and why they were unjustified considering jades prior action and disregard for the legitimacy of the council?(which has already been documented)"
"[ 2008.06.08 21:46:20 ] darius johnson > well she did get two official warnings<U+FEFF>[ 2008.06.08 21:46:29 ] darius johnson > maybe the channel is enforcing rule![ 2008.06.08 21:54:29 ] darius johnson > well the meeting's not over, so what happened will be included whether you like it or not[ 2008.06.08 21:58:21 ] darius johnson > well it's cool, just mute them next time you don't like what they're saying and we'll be cool[ 2008.06.08 22:01:24 ] darius johnson > so what? who the hell are you?[ 2008.06.08 22:02:43 ] darius johnson > let's just mute everyone and move onanyone thinking clearly will see that these are emotionally charged baits for jade to get hooked on and drag themeeting further into a conflict. they add nothing constructive to the meeting or the topic.go ahead goumindong, spin away. i'm sure you will find someway to warp this around."
"nothing to spin. one of these comments was not directed at jade and the rest are quite clearly responses to jade's unauthorized disenfranchisement of an elected representative. really the comments are quite tame in comparison to what the situation deserved. really i don't see why anyone would bring up comments made in response to the topic of this thread unless the desire was to deflect from the issue at hand."
"you're quoting darius opposing jade's conduct? multiple csm members have taken issue with jade's very controversial actions during that meeting so i don't see how an \"emotionally charged\" response can be viewed as unreasonable- espectially from the candidate who has been the most active in keeping the current chairman's presumptions of power in check and advocated for equality in the powers of all csm members."
"how are those \"responses\" !? clearly those do not add anything contructive to any topic or the flow of the meeting at all.in addition, qualifying them as \"tame\" doesn't mitigate the fact of what they are. flame bait. they are hooks for someone to catch and pull them into an emotionally charged conflict.you can't spin out of that. those are not \"responses\", they can only be categorized as \"outbursts\"sorry, you don't get a free pass to make outbursts to bait the room into even more conflict just because you feel emotionally justified.no meeting needs or requires a \"righteous instigator\" to drag it into the mud."
"you actually. you've stalked these forums for the last three weeks like some kind of morbid vulture picking holes and singing songs of doom and gloom and anytime anybody actually tries to engage with you they get more carping criticism and nit-picking leaving the poor respondent wondering they bothered in the first place. i've tried to explain the situation to you but you still insist on trying to blame and whine and complain about whats been done over the course of three weeks of frenetic struggle to get this show on the road. at this stage arithron though i'm deeply tempted to tell you where to get off i'm still going to advise my fellow csm reps to try and reach middle ground with you on these multi-item issues, but i'm going ask you in turn to shelve the pettifoggery for long enough to see we are actually trying to work with you here and do the best we can do. i feel i must reply to such a personal attack, which i feel is totally out of order and not in keeping with your supposedly high standards of societal duties that csm reprsentatives are supposed to have.how have i stalked the forums? i have brought up issues that affect the players of eve. i have always been polite, non-personal and non-insulting. everything i have raised has been backed up via csm documentation or posted forum comments. you clearly have mistaken me for someone else 'singing songs of doom and gloom'! i want the csm to work...i stood remember, and will be doing so again next time around.maybe you take players pointing out the guidelines and rules personally? i can't apologise for that, since i have never attacked anyone personally.you don't need to work with me, you need to work for me and all the other 220,000 players that you represent. the issue i raised regarding multiple issues as one post and vote affects everyone. if my concern for due process and rules concerns you, again i can't apologise- someone needs to raise these issues and highlight the areas of concern.take care,bruce hansen"
"so categorize them as \"outbursts\". i won't be losing any sleep over it. i'll instead be concerned about things that matter... such as council members being able to speak."
"i'm sure you won't. transparent as glass my friend. the csm is a delicate boat and everyone is more then happy to grab a rope and pull. the chance to entertain themselves watching it capsize is too compelling."
"a man in a crowded theater yells \"plural n word, there is a fire\". there are many appropriate responses for this. one of which is to run, another of which is to object to the use of offensive language. neither of these qualify as \"furthering the discussion\" and all might be considered \"outbursts\"you are walking down the street, and a man next to you get stabbed. \"holy ****, call the police\" is an \"outburst\", but it is also a clearly an appropriate response.many times when someone does something outside of the rules, appropriate responses certainly include actions that do not further the discussion.another example, closer to home. responses that are /signed with a thumbs up in the assembly hall are not discussion, but since the assembly hall is a place where players are to voice their opinion, its an entirely acceptable response."
"transparent? try honest. its actions were deplorable. they will continue to be. i'm not going to deny or act as if that doesn't bother me. it does and it's wrong. v0v if that's a bad thing in your eyes then so be it."
"not really interested in comparing apples and oranges goum. already had lunch.again, you can't spin when darius has admited that those were already flaming outbursts. all thats left is to downplay them like he is doing now.again, you act like your comments could solve or sooth something. those were obviously ment to drag the council into more infighting. it really doesn't matter how emotionally justified you feel you were. constructive or solutions to problems they were not."
"i'm still having a hard time understanding how jade can maintain that he is in the right through all of this. jade do you honestly think that avoiding tricky questions and passing the blame lends credence to your massive walls of words?"
"it's previously been said that what darius should really do is act completely submissive and let jade do whatever the hell he wants ."
"where did i say that? they were clearly meant to be durogatory to jade. i never said otherwise. jade broke the council by disenfranchising an elected representative. i responded in a semi-ugly fashion. unlike jade i can accept responsibility for my actions and will say that wasn't very professional. i will also add that the comments wouldn't have occurred if it hadn't broken the council process by bullying yet another council member. i'm not really sure what you're trying to get at here, but i'm not denying anything... i had pushed for this and all communications to be completely public. i know when i say something it'll be read by everyone. i have nothing to hide whatsoever."
"i'm sure if you keep attacking he will eventually change his mind, resign from the chair, and cry in a corner.wait, no he won't. he already said his peace and probably is going to focus on the next meeting to try and stay above the crap that everyone likes to sling.mob politics is too brute."
"thats right, beat that strawman. ow, i beat he felt that one."
"don't get me wrong darius. i voted for you because i like your poltics. this isn't an attack on your person, its a counter-attack on the people attacking jade for hypocritically stated reasons.the chairman needs power and the will to use it. people can debate the fine line all day but what people are currently flametraining is a point were anyone in jades shoes is going to be expected to carry the burden of getting meetings done, on time, but with no real power. or with limited power that it is afraid to use because the 'power-abuse' witch hunters come crawling out of the woodwork to beat him down."
"had i been saying those things you quoted out of turn and been muted for that i'd have agreed with you. unfortunately in this case i believe the 'power-abuse' witch hunters are correct. really the logs speak for themselves."
"its not apples and oranges. do you not believe that standing up for the rights of disenfranchised representatives is the thing you ought to do when someone runs roughshod over the rights of another?the analogies are fitting enough."
"depends what you mean by 'standing up'. nothing i quoted could be construed to be working toward that goal. it wasn't even criticism, it was just bait to start a mud fight.since you like analogies i'll give you one.suppose someone accidentally hit your dog with a car and was bleeding internally. it needs to get to the vet. instead you drag the driver out of his automobile and proceed to beat the crap out of him. your dog dies due to the trauma. what have you accomplished other then venting your anger?at any rate, i think darius has said his peace and its at a point were we are agreeing to disagree."
"well i've said my piece to them already. as far as i'm concerned here's the line in the founding documents i'm supporting:summary of representative responsibilities chairman and vice-chairman: organize meetings of the csm moderate meetings delegate assignments where necessary summon alternates when primary representatives are unavailable ***its a cut and dried case really. chair has the power to moderate meetings. moderation can mean calling people to speak, warning people from speaking over each other, ensuring the correct order of the agenda is followed and yes, if neccessary its going to include channel mutes if people really are refusing to follow the guidance of the chair. where we've gone wrong in my opinion is allowing ourselves to believe we can handle rules changes to this admin and procedural stuff as a elected committee. but the reality is we're a factionalized csm with some members who really don't like other members and too much voting on partizan lines for our prospective changes to the constitution to be considered safe or reasonable. i think the way forward is to pretty much veto all attempts to re-write the constitutional issues at this point and focus entirely on player subscribed gameplay issues.i've certainly got the power as chair to say whether an item/motion can come under the heading of issue or administration and from now on i'm going to be inclined to say all attempts to change or re-write the constitution must be submitted as issues, supported by a csm rep, go through the 7 day public discussion, and come up for discussion in the meeting as a prospective item for future 1to1 discussions with ccp on and thence to a documented proposal.we'll basically take the position that only ccp can or should change the constitution/csm texts. and all we can do is make advise on that. we never should have been changing these things on the fly and its clear in retrospect it was a big mistake.simplifying matters in this way we'll remove a big slice of politics and in-fighting from the csm because issues like moderation/no-confidence/role of alternates/voting weights and such will be out of our reach (and temptation) and we'll focus entirely on issues. i'm sure there will still be storms ahead but i think a majority of the csm are behind this intention to remove factional infighting from the administrative/procedural section of csm proceedings and fingers crossed we'll ensure that from this point forward we won't be having any more silly votes and wasting the public time."
"at what point did you ever think that any amount of changing the boundaries you could and couldn't do things was acceptable at all?i also want to know where in the hell you get off thinking that its okay to mute someone who is disagreeing with your methodology of being unfair disruptive to the meeting process if things aren't fair in the first place that trumps all other said issue.its obvious you have no idea just what a chairman does to facility the meeting and you should step down be removed or learn really dam fast."
"this is not analogous. it is not because there is no fault of the driver. it is also not because the driver is not taking actions to disrupt the resolution of the matter.in this matter jade is at fault and is disrupting the resolution of the matter."
"thank you for finally accepting my points on all of the above, as this is what i have been asking and pointing out for the past 2 weeks! of course, an apology for your earlier comments might not go amiss ;)it's good to see that from now on the csm will be focussing on the important stuff of player issues. lets hope the way forward is brighter...take care,bruce hansen"
"but it does not includeeditorializing decisionsbadgering those who have already voted to change their vote when votes do not go in the manner the csm head wanted.muting people with reasonable objections to the above.in order to do this you would have to change the constitution and rules of procedure to give someone veto power. something that is not within the purview of the csm to deal with anyway.this is also incorrect. this power is clearly defined by the csm document to be within the rights of any equal member of the csm. that means everyone. not you. everyone."
"oh sweet looks like it's everybody else's faultgood to see you've genuinely turned around jade and aren't just pretending to reconcile because you've finally figured out most people hate you"
"yeah, on this issue you were right and i was wrong. i admit it. sorry to doubt you there bruce."
"so, this is how democracy ends....with a thunderous applause"
"wrong. jade did what he thought was appropriate to keep the meeting in order. people are punching the driver because they feel they found some angle to abuse him with.no one attacking jade is trying to resolve anything. they just want to kick him for the fun of it. the only ones that can do something construtive at this point is the csm by buring the hatched and clarifying were the line can be drawn. that or ccp stepping in.everything is just more **** in a sea of it."
"i always have respect for a person that can admit when they were wrong. apology accepted.take care,bruce hansen"
"cheers to that, well done guys."
"what the hell? that's not an apology, he blames everyone-who's-not-him for 'ruining' his meetings then says he will veto any attempt to remove him from power.but whatevs nameless caldari guy and member of star fraction lets continue to pat ourselves on the back"
"trolling removed. navigator"
"...the chairman doesn't have veto power. jade's gone off the deep end."
"like this is a recent development"
"i'd like to make note of the fact that this issue was not brought up until after a motion had been presented to remove your ability to mute people during meetings as you're clearly not fit to handle this. i'd also like to note the fact that you have chosen to unilaterally state that the results of the vote which caused you to throw the tantrum in the first place are null due to this dictatum. all in all an exercise of convenience."
"some people appear not to understand what it means when the status quo ante the vote remains the status quo.nothing jade has said about the vote on operator rights is a lie.the officers had operator rights before the vote. this was the status quo ante.the motion sought to change that to a situation where all members of the csm had operator rights.the motion failed, thus the status quo remained as it was before. this implicitly confirms the officers as having operator rights.it is absolutely correct to object that no decision as to who should have operator rights before this vote has been taken by the csm. that decision appears to have been taken by the officers of the csm, specifically by agreement with the chair and vice-chair. they have the explicit duty and authority to establish the operations of the csm and this decision was in their remit.the csm has now acquiesced in that decision by not voting for a positive change.if there is anyone who really believes that the csm should confirm by formal vote every decision made by the officers of this committee for their decisions to have validity then they essentially believe that the csm should be mired in procedural gridlock.committee work is where idealism meets pragmatism and often must yield. this might be unpalatable to some but it is quite essential if work is to be done.i entirely expect certain people to dismiss me as a jade camp-follower or nitpick over the chatlog and what procedure in committees means. i am afraid i will remain unmoved by this as my aim is simply to air my opinion on the matter. i have no expectation of swaying the opinions of others.cosmo"
"you vote simple yes/no. you do not have the power to vote towards an idea. the vote was whether or not everyone had power. the vote was no. there was no \"implicit confirmation of operator rights\". there was no \"implicit confirmation of the right of the chairman to mute\". pull your nose out of jades ass and examine the facts of the situation. jade was abusing his power. jade got called on it. jade muted and then kicked the person calling him on it."
"no he did not. the logs show the system auto-kicked him. jade tried to unmute on the 2nd system notification.please stop lying goum. your reputation is already terrible enough."
"i am sorry, i missed that, would you please show me where this happened?"
"i agree with adhamhnon. the csm could use a guiding hand."
"he underlined it in the post you quoted."
"no, he underlined a statement of mine. i don't know about you, but i do not consider my statements to be logs of the csm meeting. let alone \"the\" logs that show that the system auto-kicked inanna."
"making a statement that contradicts the truth is, in some quarters, referred to as \"lying\"."
"show me were in the logs that jade muted then kicked inanna? it doesn't. in fact the logs show that she wasn't on the blocked list and rejoined after an invite. inanna said she didn't leave on purpose so the only reasonable conclusion was the system auto-kicked her during the mute period.you said jade kicked inanna on purpose. the logs refute that. thus, you were lying."
"only if its intentional. such i am asking him to substantiate his claim, if its true, and the logs do indeed show that inanna was accidentally kicked from the channel and jade attempted to unmute her, then i am wrong and will retract my statement. there is a very simple resolution here, and i suggest you take it.i am sorry the logs show no such thing, nor would they necessarily show all kicks(especially if the kick was performed by removing someone from the invited lis)t. nor do channels work the way you state in eve. you are invited and can join at any time if you are on the list. when you are invited you are added to the list. that inanna was only able to rejoin once she was invited again is evidence that she was removed from said list. this is the way non-public channels in eve work.said evidence directly contradicts your claims which is that the logs show that it was an accident. you made that claim, and i would love to see what substantiated it."
"wrong. you made the original posit. jade kicked inanna. the logs, not just the system msg, but the other members declaring that she wasn't on the blocked list, show that this was not the case. thus you have no evidence other then conjecture to make such a statement.you can't make a baseless posit then try to dismiss a counter-argument on the fact that points out the negative. really, this is logical argument 101. you are trying to 'win' this by making the challenger to your posit prove a negative.the logs, all of it, show that your original statement has no support.[ 2008.06.08 21:45:45 ] jade constantine > she quit the channel apparently[ 2008.06.08 21:46:14 ] jade constantine > she isn't blocked from rejoining[ 2008.06.08 21:46:50 ] ankhesentapemkah > she's locked out of the channel though[ 2008.06.08 21:47:27 ] dierdra vaal > she isnt on the blocked list"
"it has been previously stated the kick was likely a side-effect of eve's unwieldy chat system; to remove someone from the muted list also removes them from the conversation, or something. regardless, the issue here is jade muting a csm member after being called out for childishly putting spin on the outcome of a vote that did not go his way- whether or not said objector was later kicked is irrelevant to the meat of the issue.e: kis, can you not see the flaw in using jade's \"oh she must have left herself i certainly didn't do anything\" as evidence of inanna not being kicked given his personal stake in reputation over this issue? she herself has said she was kicked in another thread. likely the events lie between both claims, in that eve's mute function kicked her as part of removing her mute."
"i do not think you understand how private channels work in eve. there is no \"blocked list\" there is an \"approved list\" if you are not on the \"approved list\" you do not get in. you are on the \"approved list\" from the point you are invited to the time someone removes you.when i make a private channel i do not have to block the entirety of eve from joining, they are by default until i invite them. its an \"invite-only\" channel.if she was removed from that list the channel would neither show it as far as i can tell. nor would she be able to get back in.now i just went and did some testing, and when you unmute someone it kicks them from the channel and removes them from the list and sends a message to the system that the person has been muted.note that this shows up twice after the initial muting by jade, which was 30 minutes for some ungodly reason that anyone would think they would take 30 minutes to get to the vote. but if it showed up twice then jade would have had to unmute inanna twice. and doing such would have meant that she knew what would happen when she would unmute someone. i can understand the mistake the first time. but not the second."
"then after all this testing to see exactly what would actually happen you still think jade intentionally muted and kicked inanna on purpose from the start or are you now changing it to \"jade figured out how the system worked and engineered a method to kick maliciously after some trial and error?\"this is a lot of hoop jumping.absurdum reductum: jade mutes inanna with the desire to unmute soon after. the system kicks her at the unmute without anyone realizing it and people eventually figure it out."
"i can't believe you are still arguing about this seriously. get a sense of perspective already! i muted a member of the csm. yep i did it! i was the moderator (chair) for a live discussion in a chat channel that lasted 4 hours and near the end of that time i ended up taking a decision that was backed by my (vice chair) to temp mute a csm rep for as long as it took me to state the terms we were voting on. hint: (while the chair is stating terms for a vote people are not supposed to be talking in channel anyway). if you look at the log you'll see that first mute notification when i clicked mute. you'll see me state the terms of the vote and say \"now vote!\" and you'll see a second mute notification (that was actually through ccp's twisted logic) me clicking \"un-mute\" being recorded as a \"kick from channel\". what followed was people voting and then us wondering where the muted csm rep had gone (thinking of course that it was quick duration mute/unmute) not a bloody channel kick. froth and emoism followed. so ultimately here's the story.1 csm chair (with responsibility to moderate a meeting) 2. moderates the meeting. 3. moderation involves a temp mute that goes horribly wrong due to ccp bugs. 4. muted rep is un-muted and given the option to vote. 10,000 alts and forum trolls cry about it on the forum.good heavens, talk about a pathetic over-reaction to a routine matter of moderating a chat channel. i've been in meetings of caffeine-crazed stock-brokers being told they aren't getting their full christmas bonus that involved less crying and gnashing of teeth than this topic."
"reduction to absurdity is a rhetorical technique not an argument. you are thinking of occoms razor. however, the razor says that the explanation must account for all evidence. it does not, since there are three total mute messages. your explanation only works if there are only two mute messages contained in the logs."
"it was more a label for my thoughts i was writing then a counter-point reply. though, now that i think about it, i should have just left it off and stated occam's razor.tell me goumindong. how exactly does one reproduce those 3 messages? wouldn't it be odd to mute, then unmute twice? it sounds far more like a technical error or ignorant fumbling with the system then someone maliciously hovering over the 'kick' button on purpose.again, your scenario would have jade realizing how the system works first through trial and error during the meeting then maliciously abusing the mechanics to kick inanna on purpose.if jade knew what was actually happening you think he would complicate matters by having to explain and fabricate ignorance? for what purpose?"
"when you mute some you get a mute message. the channel gets a mute message possibly with a purpose.when you unmute someone that has been muted you kick them from the channel. the channel gets a mute message with no purpose.at the time of the second \"mute\" message, inanna had been kicked from the channel. at the time of the third, she had been kicked for a second time. this is consistent with her telling of the tale. not knowing accounts for the first kick(i.e. the second mute), but not the second kick(i.e. the third mute)"
"considering he was the one that initially wanted it to only be bane running, i seriously doubt that."
"it's quite clear the csm needs a set of standing orders or it won't function properly. it doesn't matter what mix of people you get on it, there will always be arguments about process unless it is set out clearly.overall, i feel that almost everyone involved is failing to respect the roles of officers, representatives and alternates on the csm. where jade can justly be criticised is in being too forebearing and allowing chaos to reign. i do agree that jade should not have restated the issue of alternates motion but i am quite sure it was not intended in any malign way. the fact is that the agenda item was vague and jade was trying to clarify it. it was mistaken because it should have been left to the mover of the motion to do this.as to the things decided by the csm regarding alternates, i think they are nothing short of disgraceful and should not have been on the agenda at all as they seek to significantly alter the role of alternates as set out in the summary document. as it is, the decision made is deeply unjust to those who were elected as alternates on the basis of the original documentation.so, the order in which the candidates are elected is immaterial in terms of privileges, and it is made clear this extends to alternates when they are acting as representatives in a meeting. many of the representatives appear to feel that as the primary representatives they have a special status over and above that of an alternate who is taking part in a meeting. they do not. once summoned to a meeting by the chair (which is explicitly a power of the chair) the alternate is an equal on the committee. once summoned it is repugnant, given what is written on the role, that they should be dislodged from the meeting by anyone.incidentally, yes, the entire paragraph is conflicted with the current process of selecting the chair. the current process is in my opinion bad practice. a committee of equals should elect its own chair. once selected the chair does have certain powers as set out out in the roles of officers and members in the document. (the main power within a meeting being that of moderation.)next, the critical issue of alternates and terms:like much in the csm documentation this is somewhat ambiguous. the harshest interpretation is that an alternate who attends even one csm meeting immediately expends one of their possible terms as either an alternate or representative. that is to say, it is possible to become ineligible to stand for election as a representative by attending one meeting as an alternate in one electoral session of the csm and one meeting as an alternate in another electoral session of the csm. another possibility is that it means someone can only act as an alternate twice as well as as a representative twice. in either case, it indicates the seriousness of the act of attending a meeting as an alternate.i feel the whole concept of alternates has been misconstrued as if they are disposable stand-ins. they are not. they have a role, responsibilities and rights as defined in the document.this decision should not stand.cosmo"
"i read the chat log, jade is in the right on this. innana acted unprofessionally throughout the meeting, and on several occassions tried to turn votes about game issues into discussions about jade's conduct. darius johnson seems to have picked up that standard and run with it since the meeting ended.if this continues, i'd be in favor of removing both darius and innana in favor of csm's who can remain focused on game issues."
"are you serious?\"members arriving to the discussion enter the discussion and voting at the beginning of the next agenda item\" is neither vague nor did jade \"clarify\" it. she flat out changed the meaning of the suggestion, not once, but twiceas soon as the representative comes back, the alternative is no longer serving as an alternative and as such your argument is irrelevant"
"jesus, the star fraction drones and alts now even have goons agreeing with goum."
"quoting this for posterity. i'd be interested to know whether jade still stands by his words."
"in light of the quoted document i have to agree vigorously. it seems several csm reps were not aware of this part of the csm document, and treating alternates as stand-ins to be inserted and removed at the leisure of the representatives is all wrong.without that section of the csm document i was inclined to agree with the way the council voted, but reading it now it seems they were misinformed."
"i am sorry where does the above quote say when alternatives are relieved? we have the mandate for representatives to attend in the absence of a rep, but not when the rep is not absent.as voted by the council, when a representative returns or arrives, the alternate is no longer serving as an alternate at the moment the agenda item ends and as such, the afore mentioned passage no longer applies to them at the point the agenda item ends."
"well, if an alternate serving in place of a rep has equal power to a rep, then the rep doesn't have authority over that alternate to displace them.to displace an alternate the returning representative is exercising authority over them. but according to the csm document the returning representative has no authority over the alternate, because they are equals.to put it another way: on what authority does a returning representative displace an alternate?"
"okay i've asked lavista and the other candidates with multiple item issues via our internal mailing list to come and respond to you specifically here arithron. i hope you'll either come to a rational compromise on the issue or i'll advise that they need to be split out. okay? give tomorrow for some discussion and i'll make a call in the evening.okay, so you clearly forgot that it was patch deployment day! i still see no posts from lavista and other representatives with multiple issues. so now you are advising them to split them into seperate topics right? a pity this wasn't just done last week when i highlighted the problem, since now these issues will miss this iceland meeting. but, better that than an undermining of a process that is crucial to the csm and players!take care,bruce hansen"
"when a representative returns, the alternate is no longer required to represent the representative. hence, he ceases to have the rights of a representative, and becomes an alternate (non-acting as a representative), again, and is therefore no longer considered equal in terms of rights.to have it any other way facilitates a power-grab by the chair, as he can wantonly declare representatives that don't abide by his every instruction (such as being at work until just before the meeting) awol, and pack the council with people who are loyal to him, thus having to avoid performing a much uglier power grab by means of refusing to allow issues to be brought to the csm discussion."
"the representative is not exercising authority. the council is exercising authority. just as a representative does not have authority to bring issues to ccp, the council has the authority to bring issues to ccp. etc etc etc."
"highlighted the important word there.the debate was not about the roles and responsibilities of alternates - it was about when they could exert those responsibilities.i had no problem with tusko acting as a csm rep in my absence and casting votes whilst i was away. i did have an issue with elected (as opposed to the non-elected) representatives being disenfranchised by the chair on the basis of arbitrary rulings.i would also like to point out that jade specifically told me to bring the item forward for discussion at the next meeting when i complained about being gagged by him at the previous meeting.the fact is that we as csm candidates have been elected. the alternates were not. yes the alternates can step in and have equal rights to the elected candidates when the elected candidates are absent for whatever reason, but not at the expense of excluding those who were rightfully elected when they are available to fulfil their duties.i would also like to point out - because it has been conveniently forgotten - that in addition to the clarification on when alternates should stand down in favour of the elected representatives i also put forward a proposal increasing the 'rights' of alternates by clarifying that they could step up when an elected csm member dropped out of the meeting.in my opinion both these proposals were straightforward and sensible and the majority of csm agreed.that said i do actually agree that ccp stating that an 'alternate' is considered to have served the 'term' even for temporary involvement is ridiculous and should be changed. tusko should not be penalised for his sterling service!"
"well hardin, i agree that in general it's open to interpretation, but it's the equal powers line that makes it a harder argument to say an alternate's status can be changed by the comings and goings of a representative.i'd contrast the scenario that the council passed - where a rep coming late to a meeting would displace an alternate serving in their place at the end of the current agenda item (and likewise the alternate would step in when a rep needed to step away from the chamber) - with a scenario in which the meeting is called to start at a set time, the present eligible representatives and alternates are accounted for, and so long as a quorum is present, issues are discussed and voted on for the duration of the meeting.yes in the second scenario, if a representative could be five minutes late and not be able to participate in the meeting. however it's also a more cut and dry rule, and it doesn't result in alternates \"sitting on the bench\" only to be called in for one vote while a rep takes a smoke break, and then kicked back off the field when the rep is ready to return. i think there's something to be said for the interpretation of the rule passed by the council degrading the role of alternates, and that does seem to run counter to what was quoted from the csm document above."
"actually this i think is contradicted by the quote from the csm document, and is the perspective i find disappointing - the alternates were elected, and when serving in the place of an absent representative should be treated the same as any other rep. that they can be displaced at a time not of their convenience demonstrates inequality."
"watch your language please hardin. you were not \"gagged\" you were told you couldn't arrive at the latter half of a meeting and dislodge an empowered alternate. that was my read of the role of alternates - by being sworn into that meeting husko was accepted as a full status representative for the duration of meeting:\"and alternates when serving in the place of representativeshave equal power on the csm.\"i took a rule that you couldn't reasonable arrive late and dislodge an alternate sworn in as a representative for that meeting. i think this is poor argumentation. we all received votes from the electorate and its entirely possible that one or more of the alternates will have to serve on the csm in this session. you are making artificial distinction between the top nine and five alternates that i do not see in the csm documentation. of course thats also problematic because in order to \"step in\" they'd need to be sworn-in. this would count as them having served on the csm for the session and by my reading of the csm rules i see no reasonable expectation they should be dislodged again should the \"original nine\" csm rep return.at the time they did, but most hadn't read the appropriate documentation and since the vote outcome contradicts the role of alternates on the csm i'm going to declare it void pending feedback from ccp. i'm of the opinion now that we shouldn't be messing with the founding documentation - especially not in areas that concern voting privileges and the responsibilities and duties of csm members."
"if they cannot then the status of the representative cannot be changed and they were never entitled to vote in the first place. they have those rights when they are acting as representatives, when they are not, that status ends. there is no interpretation where this is concerned, the only question is when that status changes. by your definition, tusco would have full voting rights at all subsequent meetings, and be entitled to go to iceland. at that point you would have 10 official representatives since no one could remove the rights of a representative or acting representative. if tusco were unable to make a meeting then another alternate would need to be appointed since he had equal rights as all the other representatives and his absence would qualify for an alternate. said alternate would push the total number of reps up to 11. these are clearly not intended nor can be read into the document. if it cannot and the reading that supports your claim must necessarily support that claim as well then yours must be wrong."
"you are not entitled to rule on the csm document and make rules based on said reading.no, he does not. the distinction is made by the language \"when serving in the place of a representative\". you are deliberately attempting to change the language in order to secure partisan advantage.the csm document states no such \"swearing in\". you are again making things up of whole cloth.you do not have the power to declare a vote of the csm valid. you are equal to all the other representatives and have no special power over them as we can clearly see in the language"
"nope, that doesn't follow from what i said. you must have misunderstood."
"indeed it does. you see, it says he has equal standing when he is serving in the place as a representative and it says he serves as soon as anyone is absent. such \"equal standing and rights\", if it means that when the real representative cannot displace them when they return, then either the real representative can never replace them or both must go. if both must go, then as soon as the replacement goes absent for any reason, another alternate must be appointed. because that alt has the same rights as the other representatives which includes having an alternate vote in their stead if they are out.both of these are ridiculous. such the differentiation of \"when\" cannot be confused with the \"equality\". defining the \"when\" is thus an important part of what the csm or ccp must do. and since ccp cannot act speedily the csm must set out a way that they can operate. this is typically by way of a vote.oh look we had a vote."
"where in the hell do you get off thinking you can void something that passed a vote? i don't know what in the hell you think of yourself in this council but you do not have any power to veto or unilateral power to do anything but facilitate a meeting.it also quite clearly says that an elected representative can move aside an alternate when they come back or did you fail at reading part of this document.this entire thing is out of hand and you have no idea what it is your are doing and there needs to be a moderator that has nothing to do with the council as per real group think strategies."
"i'm declaring it void because i don't think we have the power to change the constitution outside of a formally-raised issue that is presented to the csm/ccp conference. just like i don't think we have the power to change the constitution on an electable chair. just like we don't have the power to pass no-confidence votes or boot off elected members for being disruptive. link please."

"supportin da' op. minnie caps are in dire need of some serious love, the nag especially. the minmatar jack-of-all-trades design philosophy really breaks down when applied to a highly specialized ship like a dreadnought. right now the biggest benefit of the nag is that us minmatar wannabe dreadnought drivers get to fly apocs/megas/rokhs as we crosstrain another race's ships so we can fly a dreadnought that's actually worth training for."

"i've had to go through this a dozen times... it's an inordinate pita. taking a fully fitted pos down is just as bad."
"something needs to be done about this. i agree the time sink is needed. here is what i would like to see:1. in addition to anchoring an onlining, there should be an option to anchor and online. the time taken for this would be a combination of the two.2. a queue can be implemented by allowing concurrent anchoring, with the first item taking the documented time to anchor & online, and then the second item is listed as anchoring but instead of taking the documented amount of time it takes the time consumed by the first item and the second item. so basically if i choose to anchor a corporate hangar array it takes 10 minutes. as soon as i click to anchor, i chose to anchor a silo. if the time to anchor a silo alone is 5 minutes (just for the sake of argument gents), then the timer on the silo should be listed at 15 minutes (10 for the corporate hangar and 5 for the silo itself). this way we can anchor a pos and then go do something else for the rest of the night. you can even add a queuing time penalty (+2 minutes for every additional item).as for refueling, allow one pos to be designated \"boss\" in the system, and placing fuel in that pos disseminates it to all the other poss in system."

"why don't you farm some isk about it?i think this could make things a little more confusing for new players, but at the same time this makes sense as empire has more traffic and should be more transparent. i agreethis is not about making it easier to gank carebears or people trying to rat/mission run etc. i do all these things as well you know. the main aim of this proposed change is to open the boarders of space and make pvp more unpredictable and dynamic."
"agreed! but along with this i would ask the csm to recommend introducing a new more robust scanner system to give that \"submarine sonar\" feel to figuring out who else is out there."
"ok, getting rid of local, or changing it, has been a recuring thing for ages now, it was tryed accidently once, due to a patch bug, and it was pants, co ops alts were everywhere.theres no real easy way out of it, and tbh, the \"update when somone speeaks\" argument will only worlk till somone comes up with a lil mod to get around it, much like the standings + or - in local. local use to not show who was in local till they spoke, but that changed with a patck cos ppl wanted it, iirc."

"definitely in favor of the principle of altering local chat. we need to get a range of opinions and options on how to do it, but i'm in favor of bringing up the issue for serious consideration."
"i think its quite funny that the people arguing against my idea: a) can't spell,b) haven't formed any constructive argument at all, (\"no its a bad idea\" adds nothing to the discussion)d) think this relates only to pvp,e) believe because this issue has been raised in the past means that it is a dead issue and won't give it a moments consideration, andf) probably didn't even notice i skipped out 'c' because they are too busy nerd raging.arguing that the only reason people are in 0.0/lowsec is because they can see peoples names in local is an absurd and unrealistic argument.if you are opposed to this idea, before you post i ask that you take this viewpoint: imagine what i have detailed in the op is being implemented, what checks and balances would you suggest should go hand in hand with this change?would shifting scan able asteroid belts, similar to the instances that can be found using the basic ship scanner satisfy you? (i believe this was the way that ccp was talking about modifying asteroid belts at some stage) or do you have another reasonable suggestion?edit: hey look the guy the majority of you voted for agrees with me"
"i support this suggestion if it goes along with making the belts objects that move and have to be scanned out. this would alleviate some of the issues that it unfairly works in the favor of pvpers. it gives the miners/ratters the ability to do their own scans as soon as constellation goes hostile. this game isn't about making it safe to afk mine/rat in complete safety, it's about balance.i think it will make pvp more spontaneous rather than the easy scouting job it is now. there are x hostiles in local knowing exactly their numbers without even having to be in sight of the enemy or run scans that would have to be constantly updated. at least make the scouts work at scanning the hostiles numbers/movement.also, right now if you have larger numbers, the other side is either stupid without scouts of any sort or wants the fight where without local you'd be able to force fights by not knowing full well what you are facing without good scouting."
"yea make it so local dosnt show what corp etc the perosn is in though still shows how many people are there. untill you speak then it will show the corp stuff and name. this with the constalation chat idea would be a good idea."
"the \"local scanner\" as that is what it really is, should be removed or at least only show those who chat in it while you are in the system."
"i agree 100% with this idea. this idea has been thrown around for years by many of the player base and maybe it is about time ccp take a constructive look at it. this would not only make pvp more dynamic it would also give smaller corporations and groups a chance to break into 0.0 for pvp and/or industrial operations.it would suck at first getting used to it, but to be honest this would change the shape of eve as we know it if implemented."
"the entire idea would be scrapped, because its ******ed. the only way to remove the function of the local channel and have a semblance of balance would be to duplicate its functionality right into the scanner. a system wide count of friendlies, hostiles, and neutrals. this would be even easier for you to read and would actually increase the ability of the defenders to keep themselves alive.yes, the only way to balance local removal would be to duplicate its functionality to a point where it would actually be easier to identify enemies in your system.more information: see post 40 and 41"
"i support the idea of a change to local, however i don't believe in removing the ability to gain an understanding about who is in the system with you.think of it like this, you are on the battlefield, you know how many you have in your ranks, however you can always survey the enemy and find what they are.scan probes would be our way of doing this, however that mechanic is quite slow, and it dosnt give you an idea of who is blue/red.perhaps adding in another type of scan probe or system of scanning that can be used to get ideas of these numbers.. now for fluidity's sake, this information could be rounded down or rounded up to say the closest 5 or the closest 10 for anything that isnt blue, say there was 33 in local, 14 blue, 17 red 2 neutral it would report blue=14, red 20, neutral=0obviously this is an early idea, but it gives a overview of the field, it dosnt have to be an accurate guide, just something that gives some idea and allows for quick and semi-accurate ideas of whats out there.. much like a recon mission would in real world battlefields.it could be used say every 30 seconds or so."

"the tempest is the weakest fleet sniper and the alpha factor of artillery is now little more than an underpowered gimmicki agree with da op but perhaps the topic could be better presented, with graphs comparing the dps of each of the main fleet sniper bs dealt to a bs target against range, and mathematical comparison between weapon types.ultimately the issue may be resolved by adjustments to the tempest which, much like the eagle, was hit hard by the script changes and went from a decent sniper to the worst racial choice."
"arties do suck."
"one significant problem with artillery is how the racial characteristics work poorly with each other. specifically how the alpha strike philosophy does not work well with the minmatar characteristic of fighting in falloff. because artillery has \"high\" alpha, and a correspondingly low rof, each shot fired is individually more important than those of other long range weapon systems. 1400s on a sniper bs have a roughly 12 second rof, whereas 425 rails have a roughly 5 second rof, and tachyons a 7 second rof. because beam lasers and rails typically work within optimal, as compared to artillery, more shots hit, with better quality of hits. combined with the characteristically low dps of artillery, missed shots from fighting in falloff significantly reduce the effectiveness of minmatar snipers compared with other races.tl;dr: high alpha, low rof and fighting in falloff is a very bad combination."

"hello everyone, before proceeding, what i ask you to do is to actually read what i am saying: this thread is designed not to discuss t2 bpo's/owners/fairness/game balance or any other issues related on how we feel the t2 bpos are affecting the game. what this proposal designed to do is simple: we need a developer blog, or a response to the community at large, both bpo holders, like myself, and those who wish them to remain, and the detractors, who wish for them to be removed or otherwise... modified. again this is not a discussion of t2 bpos, it is a call for the community to actually show the developers that we need an answer on how they are going to proceed - it has been a long time since we heard anything, and i think, in order to restore some calm or to cause some panic, however it is viewed, we need a blog and a response from the developer team. both parties will benefit from this \"call for answers\", so to speak. so, show your support, does not matter if you are for/against/undecided about the bpos - but i am sure you want to know, one way or another, what is up."

"recently i have been on vacation from alliance warefare and seeking solo pvp. for my holiday hotspt i choose curse and more specifically the systems ra- and hlw. now i use frigates of various kinds to roam around in and get fights but you cant kill much in a frigate solo so you need to start using bigger and more powerful ships. the problem is though that you will almost certainly get ganked. there is no way that anything above cruiser size can move around 0.0 safely - eventualyl you will get ganked and sooner rather than later in most cases.so what did i do? i brought and fitted a heavy tanked bs and spent some time \"station hugging\" i'd engage what i could kill and de-aggress and dock whenever i was getting blobbed normally managing to take out some small supprto ships before the hostile heavy hitters forced me to dock. solo pvp is a dieing art in eve, everywhere you go there are uncountable blobs and the only way to fight with any chanche of staying alive is the nanoship but still you options are limited. i am strongly against anything that will once more limt the optiosn for solo pvp in 0.0."

"black ops need some loving for all the requirements needed for it to be used1, alt account with 2 months minimum just for the prerequisites of a recon ship and the covert cyno, or someone willing to train and spend a high slot thats only useful if you log in, with at least 80m spent on that ship probably more.2, main account with over 5 months of specific training, many on capital jump skills that most of us will never use again, with something like 11 level 5 skills and thats for what it takes to get in the ship, let alone use it effectively. from when you make the decision to get in it assuming you are a high sp player already you are looking at around 8 months and something like 300m on skillbooks to get in it. then after all that you have to pay 500m which is more then what a carrier costs to replace if it is insured."
"you've had something like 6 months to rebalance it already and its painfully obvious that to justify the price tag its going to need some major rebalancing and if you want to take the time to get that perfect i can grudgingly accept that but at least give us a fuelbay and let covert cynos work in cyno jammed systems in the meantime!"
"the bops battleships need across the board buffs. currently they are a novelty, a potential logistics tool for recons, and that is about it. using them in actual battles is just a risky way to lose an expensive ship.on the same note, t2 ships in general, particularly command ships, often do not offer enough of an advantage over their extremely insurable, extremely low-sp counterparts to offer a worthwhile advantage. bops bs and commands are without a doubt the biggest victims of this problem, with assault frigs also suffering."
"this is all very wise."
"devs you realize the sin is the biggest joke in the game right? a 2b isk ship that is worse then a 50m(fully insurable) t1 battleship? come on, why even put ships in the game if they're this terrible."

"this isn't about whether or not ccp can ban people they want removed from the game; they have a catchall clause in their tos which allows them to do just that, and this vote does not challenge it. what it does challenge is their use of the clause in this particular instance- banning ********** because he was getting uppity and causing massive controversy.he did some dumb stuff after his banning, like exposing the player character of an innocent dev (though i don't think devs should have player characters in prominent 0.0 allainces personally so i'm not too bothered) but i think emotions over these old issues have died down and it would go a long way to reconcile, and restore trust between, the ccp dev team and the 0.0 playerbase affected by the scandal."

"i was not in snigg when all this kicked off, so i come from a a fairly unbiased position on this matter(i say fairly unbiased but i do know kugu and taught him when he first started playing eve), in any game if you are caught cheating you get banned, you do it in other games as a matter of course you don't also ban the person who told you to check this person out.i fully endorse his being able to reenter the world of eve so please unban him as soon as physically possible, he is the reason the council was created he was also the reason why anyone caught being a naughty dev etc now comes under the internal affairs(lack of better term) section.so please if you are reading this big boos of ccp in fact any of you who have the power to do so please let him back in game and show a bit of class."

"supportin dis!free the man"
"i'm not going to support the specific case because neither i (and i'm guessing none of you) have specific information on precisely what went on between this player and ccp. i would support a general motion that players should be able to appeal their own bans if new information or new circumstances come to light (or specific penalty time has passed) and internal affairs should have a responsibility to ensure those proceedings are fair and unbiased - if neccessary using a panel of arbiters unconnected with the initial banning to re-assess the status of the case.the principle here is that we are playing a game and yes, sometimes people do bad things and deserve some kind of bans, but this is also a long term hobby and over the course of many years people grow and mature and their life circumstances change and i think its very rare that people fully warrant a permanent banning in actuality. banning proceedings should give the benefit of doubt where possible, and only in the instance where there is clear and malign intent to harm the game and ruin the gameplay environment for others should a permanent lifetime banning be enforced. so short version. yes there should be some kind of appeal process where an independent panel of arbiters look at the case and are obligated to give the applicant a substantive reason why they are still banned (or revisit the judgement). this shouldn't however be public, and it must remain between the player and the independent panel. (and in the case of permanent bans i'd say there should be a minimum cooling off period of 3 months or so before this process should become valid in the first place.)to the op though, you should be aware that tying a measure like this to a specific banned player is a recipe for the motion to go no-where. you really do need to address general principles rather than those entirely specific to a particular person."
"thank you for your well thought out response jade. if it is required to create a more general [issue] thread about the establishment of an independent review board, i am more then willing to do so. the reason i made the op so specific to one user is because his case is the most well known and most controversial. this has allowed me to drum up support from his friends and those who feel he was treated unfairly and allowed this thread to get noticed by different members of the csm. please try you hardest to make sure that the issues the csm debates goes beyond just balance issues and looks at matters such as these because they are just as important to the future of eve as finding a role for assault frigs or anything else currently on the table."
"i sit corrected!"
"yep if you can work up the issue as a general principle i'd be happy to support it and do the advocacy work on this one. though its now too late to get this formally-raised at the iceland agenda (7 day public debate rule and the fact we have have to submit the documentation tomorrow) it can be heard by the second formal session in august. we are hoping to have informal talks with ia at iceland however, and i can touch upon the issue there in advance to see the general feeling - though they won't be obligated to give a substantive yes/no/explain reply publicly until we do it properly by formal issue. anyways, please work up the general proposal and lets see where it goes. i do feel strongly on the issue of bans for obvious reasons. i think we should be giving the benefit of doubt more and recognizing that you have to something pretty damn terrible to earn a lifetime ban from an internet spaceship game. more nuanced punishments would definitely be a step forward - as in real life, the \"death penalty\" should be a sanction that people think pretty hard about."
"this is very interesting. can you please share this specific information? personally i think you are full of **** yet again, because why would ccp share personal information of one customer with another? if this is the case then ccp have been breaking their terms of service and this is very worrying. if they are willing to share information about 1 player with another, where do they draw the line?"
"he wrote this rather badly tbh but he is saying that he nor anybody else has the info, maybe you should take a few deep breaths and chill a bit from your witch hunt and while he is learning to write a bit clearer you can learn to read a bit better."
"(edited for clarity) if you could stop flaming long enough to read the sense of what i wrote we might have some decent discussion here. if on the other hand you want to treat this like caod mk2 then i'd respectfully ask you to go back there and stop messing up this forum for other users."
"no he quite clearly said he had special information that none of us did."
"you edited your post after i made mine and then accuse me of reading it wrong? you really are childish."
"it is quite clear that while yes his op did seem to read like you posted that that was not his intention and was just a simple typo which when pointed out was quickly corrected. if you could keep your childish flaming and pathetic posts out of my thread that would be great."
"your posting is horrible, proofread and keep it simple."
"torshin had he just said it was a typo in the first place, rather than try to make me out as some flamer and not to mention going back to change his post to make it seem that way then we wouldn't be here. but admitting mistakes and making up for them doesn't seem to be something jade can do. i apologise if my first post was a bit inflammatory, but that is because i found the way his post seemed to implie that ccp shared information with him very worrying."
"while i do not agree with some of your posts torshin your honesty has just scored you a lot of points. the other drama bombers however need to **** off back to caod."
"only after it was edited. when someone makes a mistake which causes someone to ask a question. usually the person who made the mistake says \"sorry, i made a mistake and left out neither, i don't have any information\". they do not say \"you suck at reading stop trolling!\"the fault lays on the one who made the error, and narciss made no error in reading what jade wrote. its not a big deal so long as the person who made the, what seems to be, completely honest mistake doesn't go ape**** when someone asks a legitimate question regarding what was actually posted.some guy in gf found a section on the forums where i typed \"president\" instead of \"precedent\". did i change it to \"precedent\" and then call him a dirty liar? no, i said \"whoops\" then fixed my mistake. then we went on our merry ways. everyone was happy."
"while this may be true i think this current discussion is taking away from what has become a very good thread. the amount of support for this issue is right up there with the top issues in the assembly hall and i feel that we should get back on the matter at hand which is taking steps to put in a review process or appeals process for bans."
"since the actions of kugu can arguably be blamed for the formation of the csm (maybe not directly but the idea of oversight and ia for example), i'd say this is one of those rare occasions where the specific case *should* be argued. just remember that if he hadn't done what he did there may not have ever been a csm or any sort of internal oversight such as the ia (at least publically) and issues such as dev corruption would have never been checked (and you wouldn't be getting trips to iceland )."
"agreed.also, i agree with go maz. the fact that the csm is more or less a direct result of **********s actions warrants that the issue be looked into and outweighs any concerns regarding whether or not we have the evidence to judge. with the csm bringing it to the agenda they will have to, at the very least, share the information with the csm(as they must give reasons for any acceptance or refusal in writing) who will be able use their judgment regarding whether or not ccp acted a proper manner and whether or not the appropriate measures have been taken, or need to be."
"i cannot and will not support a individual case as that is a bad way for things to proceed. but i will and would support a motion that allows a separate or board to review cases of bans individually and perhaps over turn them if justification is found to do so."
"the point remains, ********** did this game a great service by dragging so many things into the light. what matters is that corruption was exposed and he forced it to be dealt with by making a compelling case. his reward? the banstick. this was a knee-jerk reaction by ccp and should be reversed. whistleblowers should not be punished, they should be rewarded. read up. the information is in plain sight for anyone who knows how to use the internet. the story of **********'s discoveries is one of the most interesting stories this game has to offer, and has generated untold publicity for this game, some good and some bad.free **********, a true patriot of the community as a whole."
"+"
"with all due respect, this is the individual case. there are no other cases like this by any stretch of the imagination, and i believe much of the mmo world is still watching to see what the final verdict will be. not understanding this demonstrates a lack of understanding in the issues or facts surrounding the ********** debacle. we're not asking for the csm to become a court of appeals for anyone, we're asking for this one very special case to be reviewed and hopefully the ban reversed due to the very high-profile nature of the issue, and the vast public support for **********."
"i do not care about this or any other individual case although in matter of fact i do know about the case as i was playing at the time. my point is that it cannot be treated as a individual case and the whole banning/appeal structure must be looked at if that is what ppl wish or it is not a fair system as popularity or lack thereof is not a just reason to ban or unban somebody."
"lolz"
"baemp him!"
"noone knows exactly what happened with the ********** bannings, bot even some of his better friends in sniggerdly, but surely since it is such a hotly debated topic, if ccp had nothing to fear, they would expose the truth to clear their name.this arguement needs redigging up and looking into and i believe the csm is the only way we have the power to do this. if any csm member wants to disagree with this then i invite you to reply to this post and argue against it."
"the ********** banning was justified using some catch-all terms of service agreement clause as the result of a dev decision to ban him for the trouble he was causing to ccp (at least one would assume this was the reason; ccp kept very quiet during the t2 scandal). it did not happen as part of any normal established banning procedure and therefore overturning this ban would not require the creation of any broader system of appeals for other bans. you say it cannot be \"treated as a individual case\" but this was exactly what happened to ban him in the first place; his ban was extraordinary (in the literal sense) and his unbanning would be equally so."
"every ban can be portrayed as an individual case just like this one is, if a appeal system is to be implemented i will vote for it 100%. however i will not support the use of the csm for each individual case as doing so will be decided on popularity not on the full facts."
"if every unjust ban could be examined and overturned i would totally support it, however most of them happen completely out of the limelight in the privacy of email notifications. the kugu case was completely in the open for all to see and is probably the only ban of its kind that has any reasonable chance of generating enough support to convince ccp to even blink at it.an appeal system is incredibly unlikely; do a little bit of good instead of overstretching the csm authority in search of justice or whatever.ccp admitting a mistake, even in light of them creating the csm council as a result of kugu's actions, and actually going through with any unbanning i feel is very unlikely however, and this discussion is probably entirely academic. i hear \"hope\" is a pretty powerful political message these days though so we'll see."
"the first part of your post is exactly why one player's case can't be a csm issue. every banned player has a sob story or an excuse as to why they shouldn't have been banned (how many of these stories are legitimate is another matter). if you ask the csm to champion the cause of this single case, you are asking them to give preferential treatment to a single person based on the popularity of his issue. this would move the csm out of the role of a representative body for the playerbase as a whole and into the realm of giving individual favors to friends, associates, etc., which i think we can agree is a bad idea. either that, or in order to be fair representatives, the csm would have to take the time to personally review the case of each and every banned player, which would be a huge waste of time and entirely beyond the scope of what the csm is supposed to be doing. they are not here to handle individual player complaints, that's what customer service is for.if the csm wants to work to get ccp to set up an impartial review process open to all former players, that would be entirely different. even so, we would have to keep in mind that it is ccp's game, and they have the final say on who plays and who doesn't, regardless of what we may think is fair. if in the end you can't put up with their rules and decisions, then the best thing to do is take your money to someone else's game."
"every player can come up with a sob story true, but they can't come up with a sob story that involves them doing absolutly nothing in game, being punished under a general eula term for causing them headache that didnt' break any actual rules."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"they can't? why not? do you know the circumstances of every single player ban that has been issued by ccp? i don't think so, and i don't think that the csm have that knowledge either. my point is that singling out one special case sets a bad precedent and opens pandora's box, either requiring the csm to perform a job which they were never intended nor equipped to perform, or paving the way to corruption by favors to the popular. opening an issue like this could very well be the start of the downfall of the csm as a useful and fair institution. is that really what you want? i'm sorry if a player was treated unfairly, i'm sure he's not the only one, but you have to look at the bigger picture here. the fact is that this is not the way to go about solving the issue. giving one player an unfair advantage over others simply because of the notoriety of his case does not correct past unfairness, it only creates a new disparity."

"i disagree. learning skills should stay as as far as i can see they activly encourage people to stay with the game as they teach how rewarding planning your career can be."
"you had better leave at the same time. i think sir you have a little growing up to do."
"i don't support this idea.leave them alone."
"you are incorrect, sir. after wasting so many days and weeks on learning skills, i did not walk away with an appreciation of career planning. i already knew the value of that! i'm not a child, and this is a game, for crying out loud. all i came away with, was resentment that i had to flush almost 2 months down the drain in order to stay abreast of everyone else.in any case, the devs themselves have stated that they would like to see learning skills done away with. i don't think you'll find more resounding endorsement of this thread, than that."
"i believe i heard a ccp guy talking about this some time ago, but they had no good solutions. i agree that having to spend a couple of months to train how to train faster is slowing things down. it takes forever before you can even start playing the game and you don't want to train anything before learning because you know you'll loose sp in the long run by doing that.i already have all learning skills maxxed out so if they plan to take them away i hope i'll get compensated somehow for the millions of sp invested (4-5m or something i believe)."
"personally, having gone through the drudgery of training all basic learning to 4 and advanced to 4 (except charisma of course ), i would have no problem if they were wiped from the database. would i be disappointed at the wasted time? maybe, but i think i'd be more excited at seeing a hated enemy vanquished.that's what the learning skills were/are to me, an obstacle to be suffered through, not an engaging part of the gameplay or an element of what makes the experience fun and enjoyable. honestly, if i weren't so stubborn/obsessive, i don't think there's any way i would have lasted in eve through the bulk of my learning time. as it was i barely logged in for a good part of it.for all the vets who say \"we had to do it, so they should stay,\" do you guys actually hear yourselves? do you realize how much elitist crap that is? or do you just not remember what it was like? don't give me this \"it was a good experience,\" or \"it was fun,\" crap, i've been there, i've done it, and it stank like a manure heap in august.if we get compensated for our time spent training learning skills, that'd just be icing on the cake. it'd be simple enough, just let those with sp in learning skills spend those points on oether skills. whichever skill they activate for training next gets those points applied to it instantly, and so on with the next skill until they run out of extra sp, and then normal training resumes. but as i said, i'd be happy enough just to see them go.if you're concerned about being able to use learning skills to correct poor attribute choices made at character creation, i have a couple ideas on that. one is to have a limited set of trainable skills, similar to the current learning skills, except with the training time independent of the current level of the skill, but rather scaling according to your current level in that attribute (minus implants). the idea being that if you have a lower attribute, you can raise it faster, and higher attributes become more difficult to raise. this would allow for some quick equalization of neglected attributes while limiting the relative need or ability to boost anything beyond a maximum level.the other idea i had is to introduce new implants, possibly requiring a new implant slot, possibly just making use of an existing one. these implants would boost one attribute at the cost of lowering another by the same amount. this would allow for a rebalance of sorts. for example, if you put too many points in everyone's favorite attribute, charisma, you could use one of these implants to shift your wasted points to something a little more useful.anyway, that's my 0.02 isk on the subject, let's hope pooling our money adds up to something worthwhile."
"actually asking the leaning skills to be taken a way and not giving anything back to the \"vets\" is kind of a slap in the face. as you call them elitist for telling you \"we did why shouldn't you\" is in the same vein as you telling them \"tough deal with, it sucks\".so you are being no better than the elitist bad guys you are so bent on making sure they do not get what they have worked hard for. because you are not only taking away what they invested, you are taking away what they will earn in the future."
"this alone confirms to me that you're lying."
"and ur a goonie **** sucking troll"
"bitter much? why don't you go back to bwf and lose a capfleet over it."
"fyi, this is what a troll looks like:what i don't understand is how you can believe that just because there are a lot of people that disagree with you, that our opinions somehow become less valid. should we then put the people with the fewest votes on the csm? when voting is involved, the outcome has everything to do with \"collectivist activity\".i understand that the csm documentation is poor at best, so it's understandable that you and the rest of the members would either ask for clarification from ccp, or hold a vote regarding the council's process. it's not a waste of time at all that you would want to do this; in fact, if i recall correctly, most of the first meeting was centered around straightening out the duties of the council itself. i agree that it was a waste of time, but it was necessary, given the circumstances. until ccp produces a better document, is it not one of the duties of the csm to determine what the duties of the csm is? and if the majority agrees, the motion is passed. this is democracy.however, when you say things like \"i've made the mistake of allowing this council a little too much democracy,\" you open yourself up for attack and derision. this is supposed to be a democratic process, and it's frustrating that you're not willing to work with either your constituents or the rest of the csm in a democratic process."
"surely an amicable resolution could be reached by holding a vote betweeen the csm representatives as to whether implementing the stand-in vote involves a modification to the csm constitution or simply stands as a clarification of the constitution.if jade seems to think he can decide this key issue as chairman of the csm despite all csm representatives being equal then surely the natural way to resolve it is to give all reps an equal say in the matter by putting it to vote?this has the caveat that the vote will likely go the same way as the original stand-in vote being contested, meaning jade loses his tantrum issue."
"i can't find the jade bit you quoted. where was that said?"
"two threads for this issue means double the votes."
"this is a clear chance to prove that the majority of the playerbase that you are supposed to represent trust you via a vote of their elected representatives so you shouldn't be afraid of the vote as it will vindicate that you are the subject of a loud but very minor goon faction, unless of course you admit that the majority of the playerbase finds the way you have been acting harmful and detrimental to the health of this democracy experiment and would rather have a non-partisan chairman elected.we don't need or want a goon as a chairman, we would be happy with whoever the council decides in an open vote with all members present."
"having an open vote for a new chairman would be the fastest, least deceive and most productive thing this council could do. you owe it to the playerbase to elect someone that a majority of the council can stand."
"agree"
"yeah, i'm having a hard time of finding it myself. it might have been in another thread or something, i'll look :\edit: found it. (you may recognize it from the thread where he called you fickle.) thanks, eve-search!"
"quoting dis to give non-support"
"it's nice to have one's suspicions confirmed. yep, vote of no confidence in \"jade constantine\" since it's been very clear that he's not up to the task at hand."
"all hail f<U+FFFD>hrer constantine!"
"i support this issue."
"it's also how committees don't work, they waste tons of time and effort bickering and voting over things that have nothing to do with why they were created in the first place."
"remember that all those who's guys did not get voted in now have a target for all that disappointment and bitterness and i defy you to claim that most eve players (especially those who want nerfs or changes to the game) are not that petty."
"this has my full support."
"supported enthusiastically."
"jade is worthless - supporting this."
"wow your corp has one member - thanks for letting us know how you really feel alt."
"every kind of council or government body (the latter we don't have here actually) needs a means to remove the head of that body to maintain functionality and to prevent grasps at autocratic powers.the ability of the council to call for a vote of non-confidence against the chair is supported."
"supported."
"this procedure is necessary. supported."
"after ive seen the results and that jade is becoming boss of the csm i thought to myself \"this will make a wonderul thread\" and here we are.i support this"
"supported, as with the other thread.the chairman needs to be a unilaterally chosen member by the delegates from the delegates."
"you have to actually click the supported checkbox. unless you voted earlier in the thread."
"i'm sort of torn on this, because leaving jade as the chairman is bound to generate some delicious drama, but on the other hand i wouldn't want to see csm completely fail. supporting."
"those of you who are going along with jade out of a knee-jerk anti-goon stance should consider how you'll feel if his power grab succeeds. what if we then don't decide to split our vote next time, and instead corner the god-emperor chair for ourselves?"
"what."
"had gs not decided to split its vote we would have likely taken the chair. such the question is posed.since its unlikely that gs will go away in the next 5-6 months. and since there is also likely to be another csm election: \"how do you feel about giving the chairs these wide and ridiculous powers when the next person to have them at their disposal will likely be from goonswarm?\""
"chairman arghy has a nice ring to it."
"i personally am all in favour of having a member of goonswarm as the next csm chairperson with these powers. as long as the csm logs remain public. gouimdong as csm chair has a nice ring to it. you are going to be standing again i trust?"
"i agree with this summary and therefore give support to this issue."
"i can imagine darius sitting on a throne at the csm meeting, completely ignoring everyone and just pushing his own agenda while laughing manically (and just muting everyone so they cant vote)."
"wow your corp has thousands but you guys did not get anybody on the council chair i guess that shows how much regard ppl have and how ppl really feel about you tards.ps: scuttle back under your rock on caod goon you do not belong here."
"we have two.edit: removed those smilies, one was quite sufficient."
"fixed my grammar error and re added the smiles."
"i will be, if only to continue the running joke when i lose."
"really arghy would be great. we have rules for his postings on our forums.3. arghystop posting threads in the war room you crazy neckbearded bigot. if you have some fantastic idea you really think deserves a thread, ask one of your literate squad members to translate for you. otherwise, take it to spacegbs where you are revered as some sort of idiot messiah. this goes for arghy-esque, arghy-like, and arghy-onic posts, no matter who posts them.just imagine four hours of arghy and people having to read through it would be unreadable."
"checks and balances."
"there is a clear definition of majority. ccp in fact formally specified the voting formula. \"simple majority\". simple majority is defined as a voting system where the ayes outnumber the naes, and an absentee or abstain vote is counted as neither.there is no grey area in this system. its the most widely used system in meetings in the world, because its so rigidly defined. if you count an absentee or abstention as a nae, its called \"absolute majority\". there are precisely 2 (well theres also modified majority , so 3 really) systems for majoritarian decision making. ccp has stated the one to use.so yeah. you guys hands are tied on that one. its about the only thing ccp has mandated."
"supporting this, though i wish it weren't necessary. :("
"somehow i missed this thread earlier"
"our candidate would just mute every other delegate and pass everything goonswarm wanted 1 vote to nothing. if the others tried to remove him from power there would be literally nothing they could do because the chair can do these kinds of things without repercussion. jade hasn't gone that far (yet) but it just goes to show how jade's insane interpretation of the rules removes any traces of democracy from the csm."
"thumbs down.. mostlyto all the people who feel this falls under \"checks & balances\", is it really necessary? the term of office is so short anyway, the balance is that if you don't like what the chairman (or any csm representative for that matter) does, don't vote for them next time.the only way i would support this is if the process were as follows:voting \"no confidence\" in a csm member-a vote of no confidence may be initiated by any csm member against any other csm member.-a vote of no confidence may not be initiated by an alternate csm member.-a vote of no confidence may only be initiated against a particular csm member once during that individual's term in office.-any csm member may only initiate a vote of no confidence once during their term in office.-a successful vote of no confidence requires a unanimous decision by the remaining council members.upon a successful vote of no confidence:-the csm member in question will be expelled from the council immediately upon conclusion of a successful vote of no confidence against him or her.-if the expelled csm member holds a billet (chairman, vice chairman, secretary, vice secretary), then the billet will be filled by one of the remaining council members, to be determined by a council vote and requiring a simple majority to win.-the alternate csm member who received the most votes during the election for that term will be elevated to csm member status.upon a failed vote of no confidence:-the matter is considered final and no more time should be wasted on the issue."
"i'm completely uncomfortable with the direction that jade constantine might take this game due to his past involvement in a roleplaying brothel chatroom inside eve."
"truth."
"yupers."
"if i had a million isk every time a goon called me a liar i'd be rich beyond the dreams of avarice. you really are getting desperate."
"so is that not your site? is being extremely misleading not considered a lie?"
"remember ccp doesnt admit to lag, instead they claim that its a client side problem, and their customer service fails to document the problem, by just stating that there was no server error. according to customer service its a client side problem. this is the furthest from the truth of the issue. there is a problem and customer services need to document these error, i dont care about, code, internet bandwidth, or whos closer to the iceland. there is clearly a lag problem, and since half the times i die in lag and dont get kill rights i have to assume the server is simulation combat. but after 3 years its time to start document lag issues correctly. the customer may never be pleased but you cant say the customer is wrong. csm should use this lag issues as their first concern to improving new eden"
"i think most people would agree that something should be done to allow large fleet battles to continue fairly and relatively lagg-lessly. 'timer bars' that wait for your opponent in system are possible solutions, if one side is lagging. capping system population by putting wait ques on gates are another solution to lag.ccp should admit that this is a real problem and work on solving it. answers from ccp representatives saying that lag does not exist are not acceptable."
"oh yeah, it's already fun wiping out entire alliances - but to be able to destroy everything they've built? count me in. i want to be on an outpost killmail that details every item that every resident just lost - or has a chance to be dropped and looted like every other kill does. i think every ship should be ejected into space, boardable. it would be a lovely pinata of tears."
"i fully support this station-related mechanic that was proposed by a leader of an alliance too worthless to hold a station."
"eve maps' last update reported that no fewer than nineteen outposts changed hands in the previous eleven days. huge wars rage in fountain, geminate and elsewhere. jade's idea that 0.0 is stale and static is therefore revealed as nonsense.likemost people in this thread (and apparently all but 39 people from a player base of hundreds of thousands) i am against this proposal.to be fair, it would benefit some people: it is perfectly suited to the playstyle of jade constantine, 0.0 failure and minmatar space terrorist, for instance. but if you are in a small alliance, perhaps made up of players not lucky enough to hold dyspro moons and t2 bpos, and not blessed with a thousand fellow members, then bear in mind that in the massively unlikely event that this proposal got through you can kiss goodbye to motivating people to invest in an outpost, no matter how mediocre the space you want to hold. you'd just be a weekend outing for the goons, bob or some other super-alliance.on the upside, thanks to jade for posting this idea: now that ccp have seen how unpopular it is the risk of implementation tends towards the square of zero point zero."
"dreadful idea, the larger alliances would simply put down any attempt to access 0.0 for years to come.voting no."
"while i have to admit that idea really makes me smile i did actually get talked into the compromise solution by hardin's crew of letting personal hangers remain in the wreck. i think fully destructible and everything in the station is lost is within the spirit of eve pure and simple i have to acknowledge that changing that on the fly and seeing outposts taking out the possessions of people who \"thought\" they'd be eternal would be a little unfair. hence the compromise solution espoused in this thread and supported to the iceland summit by vote of csm. now we just need to hear what ccp think about the general principle."
"jade, how did you feel when an actual mmo game designer who has studied a game that failed directly because of the type of system you want to implement was telling you the same things that i have been telling you for so long?"
"id not like to see what this type of idea will ultimatly become, several thousand r*tards traveling around eve in a big **** train popping outposts and nothing else. now the idea sounds good and fun and interesting but the truth is ppl will abuse it like they do everything else."
"heh, i usually make a habit of not getting involved with you but this one is just too funny. i'm guessing your referring to the \"game designer\" mahrinskel of orbis games right? well, don't want to burst your bubble but he works for a company that makes virtual house ranching simulators now i'm not knocking his professional knowledge goum, but neither am i yielding that this experience counters five years of playing an actual pvp game at the sharp end.sorry, but if you expect me to doff my cap to the man behind sand box farm its not going to happen. sure these are games, they are even online multiplayer games. but nope they are not eve, and i'm happy disagree with this guy to exactly the same extent i disagree with you."
"wow, two supports on one page that has to be some kind of record.although they where probably just some weak anti-goon troll."
"shadowbane?"
"when was the last time you held space in 0.0?"
"the stories about them trying to get space in 0.0 are even more funny, you should ask about that."
"oh good, now you have decided to get involved this will be fun. a question jade. since you have made this about qualifications for so long. why is it that you trust the opinion of someone who has failed at every turn to hold 0.0 space and is irrelevant in its operation. so irrelevant that you couldn't even deal as much damage as triumvirate against cva who promptly failure cascaded not long after their invasion. whose expertise lies in mythical literature. why do you trust that person over a person who has studied games operations and makes games where multiple players interact. and a person with expertise in economics and international relations. economics being the study of how people act and international relations being the study of groups of people act.how does \"king arthur and his court\" give you unique insight into the machinations of empires over \"the grand chessboard\"well then you will have to excuse me for trusting the opinion of people who have studied how people and nations behave based on changing conditions rather than the opinion of one who studied arthurian legend.indeed."
"no support."
"you're never going to have an outpost for us to destroy so no i can't support this."
"over the same period, i was a member of fix, and originated the \"fortress querious\" doctrine. i've got a crappy kill ratio because i spent all my pvp time in covert ops. i was there when hans roaming opened the \"pearl harbor\" cyno in fat. i was there when the lights went in in 9cg at the tail end of the coda war. i was there for both \"battles of the egg\" in ed-. i was there for both prohibition ops, the first \"capital blob\", the death of iss, and the subsequent (failed) invasion of querious by d2 and all their friends. i personally flew the jump bridges to break the siege of 49-u (14 jumps, half of them unescorted in a fenrir).i'm not claiming to be some pvp powerhouse. but i think i've got the chops to disagree with you with some credibility.--dave"
"i'm not going to give any suggestions on, say, restructuring hisec missions or veldspar roid respawn rates and i would ask in turn that empire dwellers keep their 0.0 warfare legislation to a minimum, jade"
"no support. its an absurd mechanism that would be hated by the playerbase and very seriously break 0.0i trust the council does the right thing and kill this proposal, as it has no democratic support."
"no support. treating alliances like rational players, the best move for them to make would be to create dead-zones of space between the superpowers, reducing conflict and preventing new alliances from establishing themselves. there are other ways to increase the dynamics of 0.0, i believe this proposal would serve to do the opposite."
"no support.more power to large alliances to keep small alliances out of 0.0 = bad."
"jade, i told you on that other forum, before you threw your snit, that i don't chase around the internet trying to defend my professional reputation, and i meant it. so i'm not going to defend my credentials as a game designer to you. however, as an analyst and player of games i go back to games nearly nobody here has heard of, from the dim-darks of the early 90's. in eve, i have been playing since september 2004, and i was a member of a 0.0 alliance from 1 month later. i was involved in the strategic positioning of fix all through the coda, prohibition, and great war phases, leaving that role a few months before fix's retreat from querious because i felt that the leadership's views of how to handle strategy and logistics would leave us incapable of defending our space. i correctly anticipated the strategic implications of every significant change to the game throughout that entire period, and made my character one of the minor plutocrats of eve by anticipating their economic effects. iow, i won't chase google alerts to defend my professional reputation from the likes of you in random internet locations, but i will defend my reputation in eve on the forums of the game.here is a reproduction and expansion of the arguments i made against your proposal on that other forum:this change will not have the effects you say it will, and what would likely happen instead (among other things, \"small but leet\" pvp outfits that aren't interested in holding territory and can't match even a small alliance capital throw weight would have a way to inflict serious damage on them, and with dedication could make any arbitrary chunk of 0.0 unsuitable for any level of exploitation higher than that of around 2004. number of super-powers would quickly be reduced, with no-man's-land regions between them where they allowed no development at all, only hunter-gatherer operations like 2003. iow, he hides it under a wall of text and a few convincing lies, but jade really is just pushing an agenda that will be better for his faction.0.0 warfare has definitely gotten just too damned expensive, and too random. there may be 100's of capitals running around, but their pilots do *not* think of them as disposable, they were the product of weeks of effort and can't be replaced in a hurry. if two 100 capital fleets meet, and one loses 20 and the other loses 40, the \"winning\" side has 20 guys ****ed as hell about the time it will take them to rebuild (and the losing side has that problem twice over, plus they probably just lost something strategically important). only a few alliances have supercap blobs, for everyone else the loss of a supercap is a threat to their continued existance, but they have to use it in coordination with allies or they won't get support when they need it.against the background of this, you have players finally realizing that scannable complexes and belts combined with jb freighter logistics has hugely increased the amount of people who can be supported by a chunk of 0.0. and since there's safety in numbers, they gather in places of strategic utility and just own the rest strictly in terms of denying it to others. the potential productivity of a single, fully developed, region is staggering, which is why jade can ***** about so much money flowing around 0.0, they own turf that is making them rich, he doesn't want the hassles of owning turf, so he wants a way to take away their territorial advantage since he won't adopt it.all the wealth of 0.0 is ultimately dependant on jb's and outposts, and their defense is hinged on cyno jammers. so he's metagaming the designers into letting him break the small-to-medium alliances. or trying, anyway, i hope they're smarter than that.increase the costs of participation in pvp, you reduce the amount of risk people will take, and their participation level in pvp declines, period. we have seen this in every game that allowed pvp, from the 80's right through today."
"this is passably the worst idea ever, the idea of taking an enemy station and holding it is a fantastic mechanic.like it was said earlier, if stations become destructible, the larger coalitions would just powerhouse through and clean space of the smaller powers.jade this is really really horrible."
"i just want to see him edit ever single post on these forums like he did on f13 with wall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of text"
"the destructible outpost is a unique look i guess. but in the same breath you are advocating for new alliances to have the opportunity to get a foot hold. (i hope i correctly interpreted what you were trying to say.)however. what you are setting up is a scorched earth policy. and no little out fit would have much of any chance and the larger alliances would become much stronger and a greater threat.unless you are trying to marry this with the other proposals from your alliance about capturing gates as part of the package.however, now thinking about it, it is kind of clever. all you would have to do is just wait until the big boys all but kill them selves off and move right in and take space. after the mayhem i guess one could write him/herself a decent storey about rebuilding eden as a role playing base."
"hello all,i have had an idea for this game based off what i have heard from numerous sources, and so can only imagine it to be true: that ccp does not delete any expired account characters. the amount of space that these old characters take up must be staggering, and will only increase with time.here's my idea, which should be both a standing policy and apply retroactively: all characters in the game whose account has been inactive for six or more months and with 2 million or less sp should be deleted to clear up storage space and free a lot of names for the playerbase.1) if an account has been inactive for six or more months, the player might possibly not be coming back, especially if it ties in with item two. six months allows somebody who has played the trial but might not have enough money or interest to return immediately to still have their work saved for a significant ammount of time.2) a character who has been played for more time than the trial period will likely have more than 2 million sp, as that is an easy amount to acquire. if not, the name is most likely a placeholder or something of that nature.comments? questions? am i out of my mind? well, maybe the answer to the last question is yes, but what do you guys think of this idea?"
"just giving my support to this topic, since i can't do that in my original idea thread."
"1) actually it does not take that much space. and, space is not an issue for ccp, one terabyte hd will hold enough space to keep all the character information needed for the next 10 years. 2) it does not affect eve performance in any, rather any unused characters and corporations are not affecting eve detrimentally in any way when it comes to performance. 3) deleting/removing any character from the game, since it has never been done by ccp, especially after such a short period of time like 6 months, is not reasonable. allot of people go on deployments which are longer than 6 months. allot of people might have rl issues which would prevent them from playing eve for longer than 6 months, etc. sorry, not supported. what i would support - is deletion of corporate tickers from all corporations that are no longer active and are \"closed\" or maybe even deleting those altogether."
"i was going more along the lines of whiny 39 year old man child."
"fail forum is fail"
"where did you come across these quotes?i don't think that was him, i think the admins were fed up with his rhetoric."
"what kind of forum***** are you? pfft."
"the name-change was schild, the multiple wall of text edits temper tantrum and fleeing from the site was all jade."
"this is true. you can tell based on the edit times; he went back and edited every single one of his 50 posts.psycho."
"here:"
"oh hey, and they're both in a reply to a post of mine :downs:"
"he said he would step down if he was elected anyhow. i say eh actually let it be put to a vote."
"you're telling a csm representative to resign because they were unfairly muted and went on to talk about it? i think you've forgotten to put your star fraction ticker on there buddy.inanna's reaction to the whole thing has been fairly tame, enough to oppose jade's bullying around votes but calm enough not to fan the fires of controversy."
"support."
"jade as chair has repeatedly sidetracked the csm onto time wasting issues with the powergrabbing etc and we need someone as chair that is not so decisive. the new person obviously does not have to be member of goonfleet and i think we all would be happy with someone who would stop trying to give power to herself and then crying foul when people disagree."
"inanna accused jade of willful wrong-doing in the meeting before she was muted, so obviously that didn't have to do with the muting. she did it multiple times, also. then she accused jade of willful wrong-doing for muting her, and continues to accuse jade of willful wrong-doing both for muting her, as well as for pretty much everything else jade did in the meeting.inanna has been consistently focused in her accusations against jade, both before the muting as well as after. it needs to stop, or inanna should step down. she is not acting in the interest of the player base. she didn't add anything to csm meeting 3 except her criticisms of jade, and she isn't doing anything now to resolve the issues the council is having.she can certainly do all of that from the e-o-boards, just like all the members of goonfleet. there's no reason to waste a council seat for that. give it to someone who can focus on game issues."
"how can we have someone as chairperson who is obviously so decisive. she has admitted time and time again that she bears hostilities towards the corporation that 2 of the 7 members of the council are from. how can that possibly be regarded as a good alternative by anyone? by all means lets remove her from power and set up someone who doesn't antagonize and instigate petty little powerfeuds getting in the way of the real agenda."
"i'm having that one for lols.nice quote."
"jade constantine : not my chairman"
"jade isnt letting the council decide their own agenda any more. this empire hugging gallente roll playing dog is power tripping his mind out.chairpersons facilitate discussion, not rule them. but given that council would almost assuredly vote to restrict his power, i cant blame this mad dog for banning them from discussing restricting his power."
"jade is immature and thinks \"shes\" so great...pathetic.."
"not supported"
"supported"
"1.0"
"the csms are representative of the players. nobody voted for someone to get silenced during the council. after it was discovered that she had been muted, and then kicked (due to the bug we've all been made aware of), she had every right to criticize jade, as did the other council members. the only csm who has expressed any interest in silencing other members is jade constantine. he's stated that he may have been \"too democratic\". in fact, it's been jade constantine who has been more contrary towards the other csms than the other way around, yet he still believes that the rest of the council needs unilateral moderation. this is not how a council is supposed to work, and this is why there are now threads about a vote of no confidence."
"no support"
"ummm no, jade is doing her job fine."
"instead of addressing in-game issues, jade constantine has been more concerned with cementing his own power within a \"constitution\" that regular eve players really don't care about. eve players really don't care about who is the leader of this now-irrelevant csm, but jade's power-grabbing is stalling the issues for even being addressed, much less a suggestion to ccp on how to fix them.or even suggest to ccp that they should document all of their hidden \"features\", one of the most basic things any game manual would show.the csm is not the jade constantine show. as it stands, the csm is a joke behind \"her\" leadership."
"no"
"i don't judge peoples worthiness for a job by how well they perform when it's easy. thus far, i haven't seen too many hard decisions you've faced as chair. yes, there's been three meetings that probably made you want to pull your hair out, but those are merely frustrating, not difficult, and they've been faced by all nine(or 14) members. i'm not denying the successes of the csm as a whole - as you say, they're plentiful - but i will deny that those successes mean that you are fit for the job you currently possess. it's not difficult to identify the most popular threads and put them on the agenda, and it's not difficult to call votes on them. your successes in those are laudable, but not especially meaningful. your failure, on the other hand, is meaningful, because it was in a situation where you ought to have done better and where you could easily have done better. there was no good reason for your action, and a host of bad consequences have arisen from it - the council is fractured, your reputation is somewhat lowered, and the reputation of the council has been lowered greatly. new creations are fragile and easily swayed, and just as i feel you collectively lost many good opportunities to set down methods and rules in \"common law\", i feel that your one single action, born in frustration or whatever, may well have made the csm a sandbox for power trippers in the minds of many players. even if it's not true, that's how it will be seen, and perception always trumps reality in politics, since so few people are obsessive enough to have the information to separate the two. your action was wrong on its own merits, and it damaged the council as well. condemning a serious mistake is hardly \"fickle\"."
"so far as i recall what was being referred to in each of those quotes, they're all true, and none of them is a \"wild accusation\". accusations, yes, and rather unfriendly ones, but all valid and well-founded."
"would you care to elaborate on what you believe jade's job is? here are some quotes the proponents of this thread would like you to consider:"
"i'd like to see any representative body of the player base be a body of equals. the chair, regardless of who it is, should not have mute or veto power. the idea that six duly elected representatives of the player base can be silenced or over-ridden on the whim of the chair rubs me the wrong way. especially when the combined player -representation of those six individuals is much much more than that of the chair.jade has taken what was to be a representative discussion between the player base and ccp and made a mess of it."
"thanks for pointing that out. jade constantine was returned as the top vote-getter, and per the csm rules is the chairperson of the council. just wanted to bring that up now, as it's going to be something you fail to recognize throughout the rest of your whine.that's not something that is voted on. the chairperson has that responsibility. before she had been muted, she had:*asked if bane had apologized for showing up late.*pointed out pie had retracted a war.*pointed out 2 council members did not have *****es.*accused jade of making a biased statement in phrasing the first vote.*accused jade of editorializing in the phrasing of the 2nd vote.*accused jade of not being a neutral chairperson.*accused jade of not being neutral again.*accused jade of editorializing again.*corrected jade's phrasing of \"if we run out of time\" to \"if we have spare time\".*corrected jade's spelling (your/you're).*abstained from a vote.*argued that abstention was a vote (it's not, by definition).*accused serenity of abuse.*accused serenity of suggesting she (inanna) doesn't care.*suggested serenity learns what abstention means.*argued the council should not determine if simple majority is necessary, rather than at least 5 \"aye\" votes being required, calling it a pointless question.*accuses the council of not meeting the minimum requirement for understanding how a committee/organization works before standing for election.*argues again that the council should not determine simple majority vs 5 aye votes, as it's being voted on.*refuses to vote on the question of simple majority vs 5 aye votes, as she feels it's obvious simple majority is correct. with irony abounding, 5 aye votes wins by simple majority vote, 4-3, with inanna heavily favoring simple majority but abstaining on philosophic grounds.*objects to having no vote recorded.*asks jade to \"chair this meeting sensible\".*emotes pity for anyone reading the meeting log.*interrupts the vote regarding outpost destruction to point out that not enough time was given for discussion. when offered the chance to speak for the record, votes no instead.*abstains from voting on large hull exploration ship.*refuses to recognize the vote on simple majority vs 5 aye votes.*while jade checks the chat log to verify the vote count on simple majority vs 5 aye votes, inanna accuses jade of calling the vote twice.*accuses jade of wishing \"to interpret other people's positions\" regarding votes.*on the re-vote of simple majority vs 5 aye votes, inanna refuses to participate saying that the matter is concluded (simple majority winning) even though the council previously voted against (with inanna abstaining).*accuses jade of attributing a nonsense position to her(inanna) in the first vote.*corrects jade's spelling again (bare/bear).*when given a formal warning for \"interruptions and interfering with the chair\" (a vote), inanna claims \"'formal warning' is a misnomer\".to be continued..."
"that is absolutely correct. turns out, people are starting to disagree with him; herschel yamamoto, for example, says he voted for jade, but now feels jade makes for an inadequate chairman. some people think that waiting for the next election period is only going to make things worse.no.says who? ccp hasn't said anything. there's nothing like that in the csm documentation. it was jade's idea.so i guess what you want to say is that the chairman is the only one who should be able to say anything, and that the rest of the csms are there for \"aye\" and \"nay\" votes? if not, please clarify each of these points (to include context) with why you think they are worth bringing up so we might address them and understand your stance."
"that's a solution when there are csm's who treat a council meeting the way goons treat the caod board. he is being too democratic. the last meeting went 4 hours long and they never even agreed to how their own votes will be determined. if jade hadn't been pushy about it, they might not have gotten all the player issues voted on in time for their meeting with ccp. you're wrong. darius by himself has posted more **** about jade then she has about the rest of the council. the council needs to focus on getting the player issues to ccp, not *****ing about the chair and calling points of order and ****.a council is supposed to take so long to meet that nothing gets accomplished? a council is supposed to not even agree on what constitutes a successful vote? a council is supposed to nit-pick the **** out of each others spelling and phrasing instead of getting through the topics? individual council members are supposed to disagree with and recognize the exact opposite results of whatever votes they prefer?councils require strong chair-persons for the reasons i listed above, and jade was elected the chairperson democratically. it is her responsibility to chair the council, and anyone who tries to remove her as chair is messing with the democratic process of the council."
"and some people think some people shouldn't try to overturn a democratic process just because some people's panties are in a twist.lol. yes!says me. if you disagree, please find an example of a chairperson who does not have any control of the meetings they run.unsurprisingly, you guessed wrong. csm members do not get to hijack meetings and interfere with votes. jade was more than obliging with inanna.err, that is context. you want the context of the context now?lol, goons."
"supporting this."
"so you believe the bulleted list above is evidence that inanna is acting like a goon? i can assure you, from first-hand experience, that isn't the way goons act. you think inanna is trolling? there are much better methods she could have chosen. if she has a serious problem with the way things are being handled in the csm, she has every right to address them.it seems to me that jade doesn't seem to put too much importance on time. as a matter of fact, he insists on having meetings when individuals will not be able to appear. jade being \"pushy\" has everything to do with why he's being called out. we believe he needs to calm down, and not exert so much power over the rest of the council.darius posts **** about everybody -- he's just an angry person. he has not, however, taken personal grudges into the council, and he has acted with the utmost civility in his position as csm.we're asking that jade is also removed democratically. all we want is a vote. what's the worst that could happen? we win?some of us aren't asking for jade to be kicked outright, but the csms should have the power to audit themselves, and the voters should have the power to audit the csm. that's still democracy.well, you're actually not the person who determines who has mute powers and who doesn't. maybe there should be clarification from ccp. or the council could initiate a vote.but...that's exactly what jade did. he muted inanna, therefore blocking her from either voting or from participating in her role."
"i'm having a hard time believing that people can't take a step back and see things for how they really are, and are instead wearing their in-game colors defiantly in the face of the truth.really, remove the rose-tinted glasses and see for yourself just how ridiculous this dude \"jade\" has been behaving.i think that many would prefer to see hardin as the \"chairperson\". he at least seems to have the interests of the game (and not himself) in mind."
"that's not really an accurate statement of my beliefs. i voted for jade, and i'd probably still vote for jade-the-csm-member. i just find the process of electing the chair to be extremely unfortunate, because it gave us an inadequate chair. if jade had done the sensible thing(given his support of an elected chair) and stepped down as chair right off the bat, this would all have been avoided, or at least deserved if he got re-elected to the spot. but he didn't - i'm still not entirely sure why not, though i could hazard a guess at this point - and so we're left with this mess.unfortunately. these godforsaken forums won't let me fisk that list properly inside of ten posts. that said, at least 2/3 of the actions posted on there are both reasonable and correct, and the rest are no worse than other, non-silenced, people's actions. seriously, you're calling abstaining misconduct?"
"this thread now has more public support than jade's \"big thread\" about blowing up stations \o/"
"more support to."
"ah, that's what it'd seemed like from your posts. sorry to have misrepresented you, i'll go back and edit my post. two counts of abstaining! and since i couldn't get any clarification out of qaedienne, there's really not more to say other than \"lookit dat fuggin list\". lookit dat fuggin list."

"i think decisions should be made on the basis of some sort of bloodthirsty physical combat.seriouspost:hadin for csm chair. the guys got experience."
"jade is worthless. it was already obvious this council would be of limited worth but the presidents being set now just make that worse. if goonswarm wins the next council chair are we allowed to pull the same ****? mute everyone and win all votes by a yes or no by ourselves?absurd."
"yes jade is worthless and should be removed."
"this is obviously an untenable situation. jade should be forced to resign."
"rather see the position of chair removed, but if there's going to be an executive, it should be someone who knows the difference between leading and bullying."
"generally the chair shouldn't be a power crazy maniac"
"will tech two bs bpcs be ok, i'm kinda broke atm"
"as is standard meeting procedure. apologies are minuted, unapologised absentees usually are not.gender balance questions are fine, and pretty common in the modern worldboth true and entirely validand was correct all three timeswho careshow is this abusive? should dissedents be rounded up and shot? its valid meeting procedure. ccp has explicitely noted that the meeting uses simple rather than absolute majority. that means an abstain vote , by formal definition means \"i do not hold an opinion formally, but i do not wish my silence to be counted as a no or a yes.\". this is basic stuff here.as was her rightits a valid opinion, even if it may or may not be wrong.it certainly appears true of the chair.*refuses to vote on the question of simple majority vs 5 aye votes, as she feels it's obvious simple majority is correct. with irony abounding, 5 aye votes wins by simple majority vote, 4-3, with inanna heavily favoring simple majority but abstaining on philosophic grounds."
"are they better than me -2"
"not sure, i'm sitting on a few dozen redeemer and paladin prints, waiting for redeemers to be buffed--a handful had the me decryptor used but the rest were straight og"
"as is her rightas is her rightjade was attributing her abstain as a no vote , despite being prohibited in the constitution. thats vote rigging.\and heres the nuts of the problem. jade has no formal power to issue warnings. they certainly are not \"formal\". heres why.theres an aparent contradiction in the csm summary that says1) the chair moderates the meetingbut2) \"a simple majority vote is required for passage\"now under almost all legal jurastictions, 2) is generally read to mean what is known as a \"limited freedom of speech\". specifically that the person involved is permited full freedom of speech on any matter pertaining to the democratic process. because if members are barred from speech, it is therefore not a democracy. for an example of a ruling of this , see \"the crown vs the communist party of australia\", and note that this heuristic is backed up from follow up rulings around the world. so how does the \"freedom of speech\" thing interact with the seemingly contradictory power of moderation?the key is in the word \"limited\". the moderator has no power to stop a person speaking to matters pertaining to the meeting. if someone is a pain in the arse, but is speaking about matters regarding democracy or topics of discussion, that person has an inviolable right to do so. if however people start doing \"z0r chains\" or posting \"farts\", or whatever, then yes, the moderator can intervene. but only to the extent is restrains that behavior. to mute someone for interjection or uncomfortable speech that is within the scope is a denial of natural law within the scope of democracy.jade stuffed up, and should conceed as much. i wouldn't support a no confidence, but i would if the behavior continuted. it is unbecoming of a chair (along with jades, and admittedly much of the councils concept of what an abstain vote means) and i'd remind jade, that jade does not have a choice in the matter. the chair is constrained by the very clear wording of \"simple majority\" to permit all democratic speech, and respect the meaning of \"simple majority\" to not count an abstain as a \"nae\"."
"you guys need to calm down.i read every line of that meeting, and there's a number of simple issues at stake:1) jade is still figuring out how to chair. it's not easy. especially with a typing based meeting, and unknown people. cut him some slack for gods sake.2) inanna was kept out of the chat room by technical error. a number of csm members attested that he wasn't on the ban list. this turned what would have been a simple 30 mute into a big hullabaloo.3) one incident is not enough to establish jade as abusing his powers. especially if there are technical issues. inanna needs to stop over-reacting, and so do others.4) does the chair have the right to mute people? i believe from meeting 2 it's been kinda established that he does. however, it was never voted upon and specifically agreed upon. several people raised objections, but a vote went through to not give everyone op. it was probably unwise of jade to use muting power without a vote on record allowing him to do it, but really, it's not the end of the world. inanna was being disruptive, and in my opinion in the previous meetings has made a habit of making loud objections to things in a way that seems designed to stop discussion. that's my personal view though. suffice it to say that i haven't been impressed by inanna's behaviour when s/he ends up on the losing side of a vote. by contrast whenever jade is on the losing side of a vote i notice he accepts it with good grace and moves on. if nothing else, this leads me to my opinion that inanna was out of line, and more than a few times.5) the issue of majority vote. i don't like the fact that 3 votes can push something through if 2 say no and 2 abstain on a 7 person quorum. i also don't like that in a pure majority of those present, abstains aren't meaningful. it's a hard question, but certain members of the csm were much too heated in the discussion, and that's what bothers me."
"farts"
"i suggest all council members be slaughtered except for the two americans/goons and that goonswarm be granted dominion over all the regions of 0.0, forever. it is clear that no one else is prepared to lead us."
"thats the non optional part. the csmsummary pdf is quite explicit here. it says \"simple majority\".this means. \"more ayes than naes. abstain counts as neither\". thats all it means. 3:2:2 is a pass. because its 3/5 votes with 2 abstains.theres no other interpretation. if 3:2:2 meant 3:4, then the term is \"absolute majority\". the document is quite explicit that its not absolute , but simple."
"how many times do i have to log in before it'll let me post? cripes."
"yeah, it was a bug, but in the frenzy of the meeting, nobody really knew what was going on. most of the members didn't even know anyone was muted, let alone kicked. the major problem is that jade has said repeatedly that he doesn't believe he did anything wrong, and that he'll do the same thing in the future. this does not promote teamwork. also, there's nine people on the council. darius and bane may be goons, but their positions still count."
"wholeheartedly supported. until jade goes and takes his divisive posturing with him nothing of value will come of this process."
"supported.doesn't this already have more votes than the destructible stations idea jade tried to railroad through anyway?"
"it all sounds good to me as any body of ppl needs strong leadership and a firm hand when it comes to discipline, jade seems to have things in hand as far as keeping ppl on track is concerned."
"no support for this rubbish."
"supported. impeach the pooch."
"impeach??.are you crazy or just simple."
"bad egg."
"judging by some of jade's answers, is he like 14 yrs of age?i vote to remove him from the chair, i've never been a fan of bob, but i would rather see db preacher in the chair"
"anyone who suggests that a democratic committee needs a \"strong leader\" to \"discipline\" it , clearly has no ****ing idea how a committee work."
"every committee has a chair person who's responsibilities include keeping order during meetings, and that takes a certain strength of personality to accomplish or things become a shouting match.and anybody who does not see that, clearly has no ****ing idea what ppl can be like or is looking to exaggerate the fact and need into a \"omgwtf dictator\" drama bomb to suit there personal agend just like they accuse others (jade) of doing.did your boy lose the election?."
"gets my vote. i want to see fixes to lag and making the moa not suck. i don't want this to be a platform for a repugnant little publicity-junkie to sidetrack the process in order to further his own interests and those of his alliance.serenity needs to grow a pair and stand up to jade, too: at the moment he is at risk of being implicated due to his absolute unwillingness to step in and control someone who is his personal friend."
"i sure am glad we had one man corp alt people telling us how people are. clearly their success in people management is demonstrated in game."
"a good chair person keeps the discussion relevant to the topic and also stops ppl from using \"ad hominem\" attacks and other disruptive comments like this individual seems to think are worth saying. maybe those who cannot keep to the agenda (mostly goons as per usual) should move back to caod where they belong."
"oust"
"right from the start i knew having jade as chair would be a bad move.obviously i don't know jade personally, but just going on the sheer amount of waffling he does, he obviously loves the sound of his own voice. i mean read his posts, or an even better example would be to listen to the evecast interview he did before the csm elections. all the others that were interviewed gave nice, \"to the point\" answers to the questions asked. jade on the other hand droned on about every little detail.i didn't mind having jade on the council, but as chairman, he seems to believe this gives him some special rights/power that the others don't. and nobody actually elected jade a chairman.it's not your council jade. seriously, if you care about the csm as much as you made out you did before the elections, it's time to pull your head in and stop trying to play puppet master.be the bigger man (roleplaying as a girl) and step down. you'll do more good as a member of the council, than you will \"trying\" to run it."
"get back to us when you've read the csm meeting minutes and seen with your own eyes jade's behaviour."
"did i just agree with a goon?jade constantine muting everyone who disagrees with him is wrong, not to mention 99% of what he says is tl;dr and could be written in 1/4 of the length.(already supported so can't in this post)"
"i see a chair person dealing with a disruption to a meeting, warnings were given initially then a mute when the problem continued. seems pretty cut and dried to me."
"ha ha are you jade's alt? i doubt many people could cast this in such a partisan light. considering how split the counci is already your outright lies are transparent.the only way this is cut and dried is if you really believe jade has the right to silence members and ignore votes. neither of which is outlined in the charter. so spare me your bull**** on cut and dried - jade.perhaps you should type \"wall of text\" for all your replies - it would matter as much."
"so... goonswarm have found a new griefing toy with the csm it seems. how very much unsurprising."
"jade is no stranger to relying on ad hominem. and why do you think caod is so important to us? goons post where the action is, and there's plenty of drama to be had here -- but don't worry, we'll still post in caod.is that really such a big deal? did you think we were going to be okay with this? darius and bane have continually pushed for fairness and equality to the point of calling jade out several times, and that won't change. if it did, i'd expect people to rise up and call for a vote of no confidence."
"quoting for hilarity"
"jade had a chance to act responsibly, he has shown he can't. this has my support."
"yes, it's a shame jade had to do something the council disagrees with before our grand master plan was unveiled. we hardly had any goons at all come into these forums, but i guess that must be those goonies blobbing the forums so they'll lag out. it's clearly \"griefing\" and not at all related to what had just happened during the last meeting."
"so i'm a alt and a liar??. you really do belong on caod don't you *******. 1. i do believe that the chair has the right to silence a disruptive member, its a necessary power.2. i do not think that votes should or can be ignored but then i see no votes being ignored only a proposed clarification on the voting system.maybe you should type more goon drama bomb bull****, it would save reading time."
"like most idiots against this motion you fail to describe what \"disruptive\" is - like anyone is going to take you or your ilk seriously. try harder."
"considering jade's response and behavior regarding the minuscule incident, i have to support this notion. jade is obviously neither mature, nor honest, nor objective enough to fill in the position of a chairman. remove him from chair and vote in another.it almost makes me belief that jade was voted in by all those people that want the csm to fail...."
"after seeing the attitude that jade has made in the csm minutes, i regret voting for him. supported."
"closer to 40, believe it or not."
"after having read the minutes of the last meeting it is with a heavy heart that i have to support this issue.jade you failed several times to allow iz to finish what she was saying and thus to you it looked like she was speaking while you were trying to force a vote. if you stuck to the decision made at the previous meeting to show that you had finished talking properly before moving on this may not have happened. serenity is one of the few of you to actually request to speak and signal when she has finished properly.however your knee-jerk reaction and subsequent moderation with attempt to veto (even tho other elected csm's disagreed) shows that you are not at this time capable of being the chair of our elected csm.i for one do not wish the csm to fail and i voted for a candidate that has proven to be professional, courteous and level headed so far. perhaps you should re-read the minutes of the meetings and see what the rest of us are seeing."
"i have a hard time believing a rational person can claim inanna's constant and focused attempts to be disruptive throughout that meeting are reasonable and correct, and then turn around and have a hissy fit over a single action, that actually was reasonable and correct.perhaps you can explain it for me.i didn't say abstaining is misconduct. i do think abstaining is a sign the csm candidate is not prepared. the playerbase has put forward ideas to make the game better. i think the least a csm candidate can do is review it enough to form an opinion about it, and either support it or reject it."
"did you or did you not threaten some of your members on the goon forum with infractions if they kept posting in eve's corporation, alliances and organization discussion forum? please deny it so i can post a picture of the thread with your posting, and show what kind of liar you are. many goons post on alts, their posting pattern and their anti-bob attitude makes that much obvious. let's not forget the spy goons in different alliances posting here to make it look like many alliances agree with you on removing jade. this is an entirely goon fed propaganda campaign, it was even you mr. johnson that forced jade to tighten control over the council as you were doing everything in your power to disrupt the meeting."
"jade constantine alt spotted.inanna's actions were fine, jade muting and then kicking him/her for disagreeing with his point of view is not."
"the chair is not required to permit \"all democratic speech\", whatever that means. regardless, time was given to people who wanted to discuss a topic. she isn't required to allow time to people who just want to emo-rage.also, inanna's interruption of a vote, and demands that the council support the opposite verdict of a previous vote (that she willfully abstained from and allowed to pass), is a direct contradiction of democracy, and the democratic process. for what it's worth."
"lol. i'm not jade. glad i could get under your skin though. inanna was an ass in that meeting, she should have been kicked earlier. it's not like she was voting much anyway."
"lol, caod troll spotted."
"the fact you hide behind a alt pretty much negates anything you because in fact you could be jade."
"i am a sinner and a lazy person, but at least i'm not a goon."
"this is not a motion its a witch hunt ran by all those who's candidate or ideas did not make it and also by the natural *******s and trouble makers who look for any reason to dish out a bit of venom.the votes have been counted and the candidates chosen if you cannot deal with the fact your guys lost then tough **** thats your problem."
"i thought i was the alt?...maybe its just the way ******s minds work that they need to blame and accuse anybody who does not share their delusion?"
"support"
"i supprt this. i believe the chair should not overstep their role and has no right to mute or remove anyone from the council. also the chair should not express their hostility toward council members even if the hostility is there and deserved. the chair person as it is now in the council should be able to fill 2 roles in the council. one would be the chair role to lead the proceedings and the other would be the elected council member role. those roles should not be mixed, so the chair person should not use their position to promote or try to enforce their views that they represent as council member. if the chair person is not able to keep those roles separated and do both those roles at the same time the chair person should step down and a new chair person elected. if none of the council members wish to take on the responsibility or are unable to keep those roles separate, then a chair person should be invited from outside to oversee the proceedings so that the council members can all focus on their appointed task by the people who elected them.just my 2c"

"this proposal"
"one request for everybody - could you please stop accusing every third person of being a jade alt? even if they are, you just make yourself look like a whiny fool, because it's said about everybody and you can't prove anything. and much as it's a maxim of human society that there's no position too crazy for somebody to believe in it, there's also no position too crazy that two people won't believe in it. in any group of sufficient size, even those you dislike and find to be nutty will have support too. it's cool, and i see where you got that interpretation from. i just wanted to make myself clear."
"i'd welcome such a document, but only from ccp. i don't think any current member of the csm or player supporter of csm members has the required neutral perspective to be involved with this."
"i understand your position jade. i totally empathise with it. its a ***** to be chair in a hostile senate. but ccp seem to of left the question open.the scope documents provide a power to make sugestions to them. what i propose is you guys take the document i've made as a *template*. sculpt it into something that works for you guys, and present it to ccp as a proposal on how it should work.anyone whos worked with comittees will tell you that whats happening is growing pains of a new body corporate. the solution is always to clarify the procedure. if you dont jade, people will always question your mandate.make it easy for yourself. jade, i'll put it to you to champion my proposal. this will demonstate a comitment to process, and make it beyond question that this comittee can be made to work. i'm trying to make a way that works for you. recognise it big fella. edit: for what its worth, i'm a kos widow. whilst i adore the goonies, i totally recognise they are unstable ********s at times. this isn't biased. i do think you blew a couple of resolutions, but rather than searching for blood, i'm trying to brainstorm you a way to make *everyone* happy, including you;."

"we need a cohesive csm, not a stage for narcissistic powertrips."
"nt"
"at least this shows you can't have the chair be decided on most votes. it's vastly important for a chair to remain neutral to create a good enviroment for serious internet spaceship dicussion. this is a clear example of the chair not remaining neutral and punishing a csm rep for no valid reason.if jade has ever been to a public meeting in their life, they would of realize that people can object to a vote at any time. it seem quite clear that jade completely change what they were voting on to give their own bias opinion. then when they lost the vote, lash out at a csm rep whom call them on it with two other csm rep agreeing."
"jade if you feel like you have done nothing wrong, then allow the council to have a vote of no confidence and confidence in you at a time when all the original csm representatives (not alternates) can be online."
"i'm not in favor of any player measure that changes the constitution that hasn't been raised as an issue, been open for public debate for 7 days, been advocated to the csm by a rep, and passed a simple majority there, documented as a submission proposal and been presented to ccp in the formal discussions at the conference. (these coincidently are the steps that have been taken with the \"electable chair\" issue i raised)if any csm rep had chosen to support this thread they could have done exactly the same and we'd be discussing the constitutional change to allow this in iceland. as yet none have. this is the only way such a vote could happen and i'm certainly not in favour of subverting the founding documentation to let people play politics with a csm body that is not designed for this purpose. so in short. request denied. if anybody feels i've done something wrong they can certainly ask a rep to advocate this topic for them. or complain to ccp i guess."
"so apparely you can deny darius mail about the vote of no confidence then anyways?"
"can i ask what you are talking about please?"

"i'm new to the game (loving it by the way! ) and read most of this post - mainly because i'd noticed if you got a good deal on your ship, you could make a profit from it being destroyed (though not a huge one on the ships i'm currently flying ).i'd agree with self destruct definitely voiding your insurance in the same way that repackaging does. though i don't know yet if self destruct has some viable use - like denying salvage or capture from pirates, in which case this becomes a little trickier.my main thought though was that it should follow rl and premiums go up in accordance with claims - and can go down when no claims are made for a set period of time (much less than in rl for game purposes). if criminal activities were penalised on their insurance i think it would detract from the game because even as a non-pirate i can see that this is a strong part of the game and that players shouldn't be penalised for choosing piracy as their profession. this system would penalise suicide ganking to a degree which i think it should as this seems an exploit."

"i don't understand either, tbh. you've posted a buffer fit that is inferior relative to the other cs, yet still requires two fitting mods, and are claiming that everything is fine? are you insane?the very fact that such a limited fit, aimed at the least pg requirements possible, still requires two fitting mods is undeniable, conclusive proof that a pg boost is required! what do you fear about a pg-boosted nighthawk? why do you think it will be imbalanced? justify your position."
"i'm not sure, are you playing eve? because in eve we have parity but not perfect symmetry. you fit the ship and accept not only the mods on the ship but the play style as a whole, sure those ships have higher paper dps but ofcourse they have optimals and tracking to deal with. the partisans here have a module centric view of fitting rather than a strategic view. not only do you want the hams, but also the gangmod, mwd and active tank and think the other ships so wildly ahead of the nighthawk. should i complain that because i like armor tanking, i should protest that the raven is an inferior armor tanker because other battleships have more lows and grid? the issue is not the nighthawk, it's your fitting strategy.the question always comes back to degree of performance and in this case it is fine. if you want leadership mods use a vulture, it has more grid, if you want missile damage use a nighthawk but if you want absolutely everything then oversimplifying things so persistently is silly and misleading to your readers."
"ipso fact response to the edit:the only reason i added the gang mod was because the op is hellbent on making it seem impossible, if i were flying one i would replace it for a medium neut or something.i see no reason to make arbitrary changes is all. the nighthawk being pg limited is actually not the problem in and of itself but at the intersection of a lot of different fitting issues: extenders, injectors, boosters being pg heavy not to mention the embarrassingly high cost of gang mods and the reversal of missile launcher pg values vis a vis turrets, ie close range turrets are easier to fit while \"ranged\" missile weaponry is actually easier to fit. not to mention how there are only two calibers of missiles when turret users have a richer selection and it seems like the nighthawk is the problem.making the nighthawk more powergrid heavy doesn't remedy any of these issues and in six months it could have unintended consequences elsewhere, the unforeseen costs of doing that is higher than simply fitting with more economy."
"my \"strategic view\" when fitting a ship is that it needs to bring maximum utility to a gang. a command ship that can't fit a gang mod is bringing less utility to the gang it is a part of versus a command ship that can fit the gang mod. a ship that does less damage over time as well as suffering a delay between firing its weapons and the target receiving damage is bringing less utility to the gang than a ship that does damage instantaneously.secondary to this requirement is that you need to be able to perform your job without dying. this means being able to fit a tank in whatever slots you have left after you've kitted out the damage, gang mods, ewar, etc. while i think local active tanking is pretty much worthless compared with a buffer tank in gang fights these days, the principle still stands.the issue with the nighthawk is that its inferior powergrid compared with the other command ships prevents it from fulfilling either requirement. it needs to make huge sacrifices in order to fit a gang mod, sacrifices that prevent it from bringing as much damage or as much survivability in order to remain competitive with the other command ships.furthermore, given the current pvp environment, being able to deal more damage tends to be preferable than having a stronger active tank or larger hp buffer. thus, the nighthawk's inherent nature of supporting a stronger tank at the expense of dealing less damage makes it a less attractive choice compared to other command ships even if it didn't suffer from horrendous fitting problems.you blame the powergrid requirements of gang mods, cap injectors, shield extenders, etc., but at the end of the day, its the nighthawk that's the odd ship out compared with all the other ships that are able to fit the modules you listed without issue. so either everything else has too much powergrid and injectors/reps/gang mods take too much powergrid as well, or the nighthawk lacks sufficient powergrid and injectors/reps/gang mods are fine."
"now we're getting somewhere. you're on the right lines here - the nighthawk's problem is really a combination of pg-intensive mods such as mwd, lse, gang mod etc. but your comment that \"the nighthawk being pg limited is actually not the problem in and of itself\" is wrong. other ships do not have crippling pg problems when fitting these mods; their pgs are designed with them in mind. ships like the sleipnir or onyx work well and are not overpowered. therefore, the problem is quite definitely the nighthawk's powergrid, rather than the modules in general. ulstan's (?) pg chart demonstrates this well.i disagree here also. a pg boost remedies these issues by making fits possible without crippling yourself with fitting mods. such a boost does not directly affect other ships - we're not fiddling with the pg requirements of hmls or gang mods, and hence is the obvious design choice to minimise \"unintended consequences elsewhere\".in any case, what might these consequences be? the nighthawk is a rather inflexible ship, thanks to the slot layout. true tackling/ewar is out of the question - it is a simple gank/tank gang support ship, with gang mod as optional extra, but currently cannot perform in this role. a pg boost would do is to make it easier to fit pg-heavy modules - but i cannot see a medium neut-nighthawk being overpowered (or, indeed, viable), nor a smartbomb nighthawk. a pg boost of level that we seek (~150 extra) still does not allow the fitting of an xlsb without multiple fitting mods (unlike the sleipnir, you should note...), and the active and buffer tanks are still limited by the number of medslots, while the pve passive-regen tank is still limited by the number of lowslots and rigslots. what \"unintended consequences\" do you fear? what \"unintended consequences\" are there to fear? the nighthawk is a simple ship; there are no secret uber fits waiting out there. you can't nano it with any sensible fit, you'll never make an uber solo boat out of it! all we seek is the pg boost required to fulfill its clearly-defined and intended gang support role, without quite as many fitting mods being required."
"i agree in general with the sentiment of this post but in my mind you depart from the whole premise of playing to your strengths when you fit the gang mod as that is roughly another extender or one of the other mid slots mods. on a turret ship you'd have to simply concede to fitting smaller turrets or one less gun, here losing a launcher hurts a lot more but if you need more grid for more tank you have few other real alternatives. given how clumsy gam real world implementation is, i'd leave it off every time in favor of just flying the vulture, which is arguably way too effective not only as a booster but as a midrange sniper. put another way my nighthawk would either not fit the gangmod and fit a bigger passive, fit the gang mod and lose a launcher or two for a bigger tank or simply use the vulture. i don't know that's why they are unintended. in all seriousness though you used the sleipnir for example as having huge tank, biggest guns and relatively relaxed fittings--but, i, and perhaps others, don't see much marginal benefit to fitting those 425s, preferring d180s or 220s in favor of more extenders or a better mwd in the process not to mention tracking.** if suddenly ccp decided to cut pg and cpu reqs on all gang mods in half to create incentives to use them and launched more skills too, then minmatar would be the clear cut gang mod kings, able to fit guns, multiple gang mods and rely on capless weaponry with effective ranges that dwarfed other close range guns. and this isn't even on the claymore which has an even more intense tank and bonused gang mods. then we're back to this thread, nh gained but the gain wasn't enough because suddenly the sleipnir is now faster and better in every metric.**(this comparison to heavy missile iis for example is exactly what i had in mind when i said these pages and pages of comparisons weren't fair or accurate. if the problem was specifically the nighthawk pg then the comparison would be heavy launcher iis to heavy beams, 250mm rails and 720 iis rather than the listed comparison to close range turrets. no doubt then you'd see heavy weapons seriously preclude other fittings.)"
"i've only got time for a quick reply atm, but comparing hml iis to heavy beams, 250mm rails and 720 iis is not a fair or accurate comparison either, because missiles are not really sniper or long-range weapons in pvp, because of flight time and target speed issues. we've been using hmls in the comparison because they're lighter on pg than the superior, \"higher-tier\" hamls, and we recognise that being able to fit the best of everything without compromises is not acceptable. given sensible fittings, i would always use hams over hms; actually, i'd give serious thought to using aml iis instead also - the long-ish range of hms is simply not particularly useful in pvp, and precision heavies are too terrible for words.have a look here to see the modelled fits after a 140 pg boost. fitting mods are still required, multiple ones, even, for the most pg-intensive fit. but it's a hell of an improvement on the current situation."
"i wrote out a nice, long reply only to find that my folly in trusting ccp to not have jacked up the forums after a patch has burned me once again. now i turn to using word again, and i will keep this reply brief.if you were at all familiar with the differences between turrets and launchers then you would understand my comparions. missiles and turrets are inverted when it comes to powergrid requirements for range  long-range launchers are low grid, long-range turrets are high grid, short-range launchers are high grid, short-range turrets are low grid. if you understand that now then you can see that my comparisons (from the perspective of grid) are across the board low grid, and as such are analogous.now, while i think the nighthawk is relatively fine when it comes to dps (particularly given the range flexibility of missiles) i obviously do not think the nighthawk is fine when it comes to grid. as such, i wanted this discussion to focus on grid, since that is indeed the problem. (this is completely ignoring the discussion of its nearly useless missile precision bonus.)my comparisons are not only grid relevant comparisons, but they are also (not coincidentally) as advantageous for each ship as possible while remaining true to each ships role. the astarte and the sleip are supremely effective up close, the abso is fine in both roles, however i believe pulses to simply be a better choice for the abso for a few reasons that i wont bother getting into here. regardless, the nighthawk only receives bonuses relevant to heavy missiles (not hams) and is so powergrid castrated that fitting hams is essentially useless.those two facts (relevance and general usefulness) being the case  my setups are all realistic, relevant to the discussion, and generally useful.now, to look at your setup (edit - what is even more laughable is that according to eft 2.4.1 your setup doesn't even fit. it requires 1047.75 of 1025.06)this setup is simply awful. firstly, a buffer tank using one lse? a scram on an anti-support ship without also fitting a web?now, i would have also fit heavy missiles, so i dont think there is any fault there. however, i think your setup is actually a fairly good setup to further illustrate my point. you have had to use a pdu and an ancillary rig in order to fit the nighthawks lowest grid weapons, only one lse (which hardly constitutes a buffer or a tank), you still have a gaping em hole, and you had to use a named mwd in order to save further on grid.all-in-all your setup does a fine job of supporting our argument and proving that the nighthawk is catastrophically low on grid."
"oh god, thanks silence, i didn't bother to check this myself. that doesn't fit! guess what, you don't have the pg! this is quite funny - you post a fit specifically designed to save pg (named mwd, buffer tank, hmls), and then claim that everything is fine, even though it still requires 2 fitting mods and then doesn't bloody fit anyway!this is a damning indictment of the nighthawk's pg problem. it's quite sad that a ship is so gimped for no reason."
"yeah, i thought it was sort of 'erotically ironic' that the only definite point he's made (by posting a setup) didn't even fit... which, as far as i can tell, supports our argument that the nighthawk needs a powergrid boost."
"mmm, irony... delicious...btw i have eft 2.5.2 and it still doesnt fit, so dont come here and say you eft is outdated and such."
"totally obvious"
"i would have to disagree with the op. i don't see an issue of jump bridges being active in a cyno jambed system.from a rp perspective i never thought jump bridges utilized cyno's.from a game play perspective, an alliance shouldn't have cripple it self logistically in order to utilize the protection of a cyno-jammer on a deathstar.if there is a balance issue then you should be looking at fuel / mass ratio for using a bridge not saying it shouldn't be allowed."
"x"
"it appears that perhaps you do not understand pos mechanics and fleet mechanics. i do not know why you assume that \"a smaller alliance will never stand a chance\".i find it irnoic that the brige nerf was being promoted as postive for the small alliance's, when the reality is that it actually only hurts small alliances and makes no difference to other alliances (other than those who use risk-free dread tactics)but from your perspective, it appears you are actually against the smaller alliance, which is a strange change of stance. is this the truth now coming out?"
"yorda, stop posting everywhere. you're dumb.also, serenity steele has been put in charge of framing this issue for the csm. this is kind of unfortunate because serenity doesn't have a clue about anything. hell, he wants a form of concord to operate in 0.0 space. sounds like just the man to talk about capital and pos warfare doesn't it?"
"ok, i think you're going to be surprised by what you read here: a ninja salvager is providing a (i think) good solution to mission runners' complaints about the ninja salvaging profession.in another thread, another player wrote, \"i think it should be the uninvited entrance of an active mission which creates aggro, not the salvaging of wrecks.\"i must give credit where credit is due, because there's a fundamental idea in this thought, that i, as a ninja salvager might be able to get behind.first, let's get a few things off the table:q: should salvaging a wreck give aggro to the mission runner, to allow them to shoot the ninja salvager?a: no. too many 'criminally minded' ninja salvagers might use this to their advantage, to purposefully bait the mission runner into shooting them, so they can return in a more powerful pvp ship. (some mission runners agree with this, while others do not, and that's fine. we will not all agree on this one.)q: does a ninja salvager take away a mission runner's possible profits, with little risk?a: yes. the only element of risk involved is from any npc rats that have not already aggro'd the mission runner, and might aggro the ninja salvager.q: are mission rewards fair?a: i'm not a mission runner, so i can't say for certain. what i can say is that salvage is a possible stream of revenue, and this is likely why some mission runners would like to change the rules of salvage.q: should we make mission deadspace unscannable, or locked, so that mission runners don't have to worry about ninja salvager?a: no. probes do what they do, and we shouldn't change the rules of space, just because a mission runner is unhappy to see a ninja salvager enter their mission deadspace.here's my thought: without changing the rules of salvage (i.e. no aggro, first one to salvage the wreck gets it), how can we make it more fair to the mission runner when a ninja salvager scans him/her out?simply, i propose we fix the way npc rats act.we've all engaged npc rats at one time or another, and have noticed the aggro counter at the top of the screen. it's truly useless, because the rats don't do anything about it. sure, we've attacked them, and now, they've got 15 minutes of aggro. what does this mean? nothing.i propose that npc rats be smarter!what if a ninja salvager enters a mission deadspace, and the rats that are attacking the mission runner suddenly say, \"hey! this guy's an easy target! let's take him out first!\"or, if by salvaging a wreck, instead of giving the mission runner aggro against the ninja salvager, you give aggro rights to the npc rats, and have a new spawn appear to attack the ninja salvager!i must say - i hadn't thought about the fact that the ninja salvager could just 'warp away', leaving the mission runner with new enemies, but that was brought up by the same player, and gave me a bit more thought on the whole thing.let's say that the 'aggro counter' now becomes more useful. the npc rats see that the ninja salvager has left, and warp away themselves, possibly (by random chance) appearing wherever the ninja salvager goes for 15 minutes!(this rule could be applied whenever someone attacks rats in a belt, and leaves any of them alive. the rats could 'actively' search out the player, and suddenly spawn during the aggro timer. i know what you're thinking. if the player left because he was overpowered, he might only have enough structure left to limp home, so i was thinking that we make the rats damage 'proportional', so that they don't instapop the poor guy/gal when they find him/her.)think about it logically. scan probes can still do what they do, without acting differently just because of deadspace. mission runners have more time to act, since the ninja salvagers now have something to deal with, instead of having risk-free salvaging.i think this idea would be fair to both sides."
"i completely endorse the product and/or service."
"upgrading the aggro mechanics to more actively target the softest/hardest hitting targets first i'd support, if it applied to any ship in the vicinity, whatever the reason they are there. and really, it would have to be this way, as it seems to me that a system that tried to distinguish uninvited salvagers from other people who might be around for one reason or another would be horribly finicky to make.though i'd think such a change would do missioners more harm than good, at least those who do missions with friends/alts.certainly not, this would make no sense. why would npc pirates react violently and specifically to someone salvaging their comrades wrecks, but not react in the same way to someone taking the loot of the same wrecks? it reverses the order of seriousness/legality between loot and salvage towards npc's as compared to versus players. and why would they appear to nail a salvager, but then leave the guy shooting their comrades (the missioner) alone if the salvager dies/leaves?surprise attacks from npc factions you are flagged to could be an interesting idea, but as i object to the idea of getting flagged from salvaging (especially if it doesn't apply to looting of the very same wrecks), i don't really see how it applies here.salvaging as it stands now is not broken, and as such does not need fixing. i've have seen plenty of people take action to secure assets they consider their own, and to those, i tip my hat and leave. those who carelessly leave stuff lying about stand to loose profit, as it should be.yes to more opportunistic npc aggro mechanics in general, a firm no to all the rest."
"i agree with you in most of what you say, however, i tend to lean towards agreeing with many mission runners when they say that ninja salvaging has little risk.(actually, it has about as much risk as mining, and that's a recognized and respected profession, without the 'in your face' aspects that our chosen profession provides.)personally, if it never changes, i'll be happy. mission runners have the ability to salvage as they go, have a buddy to salvage to make the whole thing faster, shoot the wrecks, or even declare war on a corporation that invades their missions. i agree that there are always options - i was just putting forth a few thoughts on how things might be able to change to provide additional balance."
"not all salvage thieves are in player corps. i doubt a war from mission runners would worry most pirates anyway.a suggestion i saw on the forums before was to make salvaging a wreck aggro against the person who created it, but when running a mission, you have an option to mark the salvage rights as available for anyone. people looking for free salvage can then do a scan for unclaimed salvage or whatever, and warp to the location and salvage freely, as some people do not salvage, due to time, or thinking it isn't worth it."
"a good idea, but this smacks of alot of problems with real life cases, where rules get implemented that penalize the majority, because a minority decides to be clowns......the simple fact is that if people didn't ninja loot other peoples kills we would not have this sort of problem, and would not be having this conversation. this ties into people camping the drug hideouts, and other places where npc's spawn. generally mission runners are equipped differently and not fitted out to specifically deal with pvp. (example having a tractor beam, and salvager fitted) so making the ninja taggable becomes detrimental, as well as spawning more npc's, and most pvpr's will be able to handle the npc's with ease, and like you said them warping away, will leave more spawned enemies for the mission runner to deal with, potentially leading to disaster, especially if they were to warp in multiple times, spawning multiple instances of said npc's thus ensuring the mission runners demise, then sweeping in and taking all the 'loot' from their mission. pretty diabolical.and not very nice.i do like the idea of the rats spawning randomly to 'chase away' the ninja looter though. has always been a pet peeve of mine in other mmorpg's where after hours, and hours of grueling work going through and instance, or grinding on mobs that some dude comes in and swipes your shiney and there is nothing you can do about it. the level of frustration can be truly epic.i understand the game is very open ended and quite cutthroat, kinda like real life, but ultimately we are all here to have a good time, and when people go out of their way to be pricks they take away from the game as a whole, which ultimately lessens everyone's overall experience. if people need salvage that bad, just partner with said mission runner, split it 50/50 then everyone wins......instead of trying to make some sort of programmed mechanic for it we could all take a little responsibility for our actions, and have a good time......i know, i know i sound terribly hippy-ish, but i am a minmatar after all, and a radical at heart..."
"then we need to deal with all those people flying around shooting at people who don't want to be shot at first"
"idk mate... i'd be extremely worried about my drones when i'm down south carebearing for isk to buy pvp equipment with... i'm a terrible pirate. if the rats stopped shooting me to go after my drones all the time (it's bad enough that they do it sometimes now as it is) it would get very expensive replacing my t2 drones after every belt and if i have to constantly recall and redeploy them, their dps would become negligible.i like where you're going with it, so i'll click support, but it needs a lot of work/tweaking. make drones not count, maybe, idk... that sounds too simple, though."

"look at the old mechwarrior games (where you could bind buttons to fire a group of weapons) for an example. supporting this."
"we already have \"overload rack\" buttons, we could have activate rack buttons, which in turn could have hotkey's attached.who really wants to click 8 turrets every time they want to shoot a new target, it gets old quickly.for example f1 activates the high's, and shift/alt/control+f1 overloads them, f2 for med, and f3 for low .. or whatever your heart desires"

"my concern is that it adds a lot of dps for one slot on anything smaller than a battleship. it obviously needs to take a good dose of grid, so that frigates don't get to fly heavies, but i think it should still be somewhat difficult to fit one on a cruiser, and even a hac or bc. 500 grid might be okay, but i'd be wary about dropping it lower. i said in my original post that i'm not sure my numbers are balanced, but there's a reason why i picked the ones i did."
"i think the grid should be dropped to 450 (equivalent of 2 medium railguns), and that should be good. this is a huge module, and should really require a lot of grid to fit, but not so much that it overly-hinders a normal cruiser from fitting it. also, if you put it in a high-slot, it'll act similar to the carrier module already in the game, but not as powerful - perfectly fitted for a smaller ship module./signed"

"hey there, over the last few days i've been reading a few posts about the last csm meeting etc. some people have responded saying things like a forum should be created for them to have said meetings on etc, i agree with this.here's my idea:create a new forum under the csm banner. make it so everyone can read it, but only csm members and ccp staff can reply and create topics. this will illuminate any kind of flaming etc that might happen(unless the csm members decide to flame). multiple issues can be raised at any time and can be read and commented on, as well as voted for by the csm members(might as well use the thumbs up or down function already in place!) the chairman/woman should get the ability only to move topics up and down on the forum, but not to delete topics or responses to topics. this means that it will be easier to see what is currently the 'main' issue that is being discussed as well as making it very hard to 'mute' other csm members.this will also eliminate the need for minutes to be taken and sent to and from ccp, as well as to the rest of the player base. as well as also eliminating any 'fighting' that might take place in say a chat channel. issues that might come up are with other players posting stuff on the other forum topics to try put in their 2c. this would mean that more moderation would be needed until it becomes clear that doing such isn't a smart idea.the main advantages that this would create are a far more transparent way for the csm's to communicate as well as a much more 'civil' way to respond to each other. it also will show to the player base they are supposed to represent what the current issues are. it will also make it possible for all csm members to have there say and not have to try figure out the best time to have meetings because of time zone differences as well as rl issues that might unexpectedly come up. there are also many other advantages i probably cant think of atm, with probably a few more disadvantages as well."
"i fully support proclamations being used in a more sensible fashion. i see no need for the csm meetings to be in real time, and a forum for discussion and voting would be better for all involved."
"i'm conditional on the issue, the caldari have to get grave digger or one featuring bruce willis."
"qft =d"
"we have support of a rep. does that mean it now is going to go to meeting and be voted on?"

"postin' in a thread."
"the game is crowded with pos towers that have been abandon. the only option to get them out of the way is to blow them up. so no loot most of the time the mods around them arnt worth the ammo it takes to kill the tower. a skill with the chance to steal or, if u fail, destroy the tower should be in the game.the skill should only work on towers that have been offline for over 30 days."
"issue: the csm has, over the last few weeks, spent a great deal of it's meeting time trying to work out how it should do things as a commitee and how the commitee should work. lack of any guidence from ccp has meant the csm is voting in messures for itself.problem: the csm will not be able to function whilst these issues are still unresolved and there will be many many more issues that will crop up over the course of this session and i expect many sessions to come. the lack of guidence from ccp has resulted in the time when voters issues should be addressed instead being put aside for this.possible solution: i believe the csm should, as a group, ask ccp as a matter of urgency design and provide the csm with a consitution and set of procedures for running the commitee and outlining the various responsibilities and powers of the offices in the csm to allow the csm to do what they were voted to do. that being address the issues that matter to the players of eve online. i have my own ideas for what some of these could be to help allivate some of the issues we have faced and possibly will face again but i'll leave that for another thread.there is another thread where another solution is outlined that involves the csm not ccp spending it's time sorting these issues out. if you prefer that please go and vote on that thread here"
"oh and yes i do support this"
"yep, supported. ccp should draw up rules (including a clear constitution-like document - i think the burden should be on them to do this since the csm is their creation), but with the built-in ability for csm themselves to make amendments to it as may be necessary.i notice that there's already a proposed constitution being discussed here, but in all seriousness a constitution needs to be airtight and drawn up by a smaller group of people. not that i'm badmouthing dippin dots, he's right that the csm needs a constitution or bylaws that lay out exactly what it is that they do and how they do it. and it's fantastic that he's taking the initiative to propose one from scratch. but this needs careful oversight from ccp, and discussion of the proposal on the forums will get very messy very fast."
"i believe ccp is already working on answering our unresolved issues. for know, that is about all i know."
"good to hear. i hope it will be a comprehensive document and not just something that covers the issues already raised but looking forward as well."
"at this point its the best bet really. rulings need to be made and the current makeup of the csm cannot be counted on to make unbiased judgements on administrative and procedural issues. we need a clear statement of the powers and responsibilities of the chair and other csm positions (and also the responsibility of ordinary members with regards to behaviour in meetings and in representation of the csm to the broader public). until we get this stuff sorted it'll be very easy for people to point fingers and make wild claims about \"abuse of power\" and moderation/lack of moderation. i think perhaps ccp themselves underestimated the degree to which the csm would be immediately politicized between factions on administrative issues and they certainly underestimated the volume of jerry-springer-esq entertainment that would come from putting nine people who don't like each other much into a chat channel on a hot summer afternoon."
"one last try for sanity...currently, the csm does not have any form of formal direction or sturcture. many people assume that the csm.pdf document is meant to provide this, but if you read closely, it is easy to tell that it is not meant for that purpose. it was written for ccp as a proposal for the idea of allowing/encouraging the formation of a player government. it is up to the csm, like any other founders, to establish how it as a government is supposed to work. if the people represented are not happy with what they, the representatives, propose, they revolt. clearly, the most popular csm related threads of late are ones calling for the downfall of the representatives, or ones mocking it.i can understand their desire to get things rolling and jump straight into issues. without a constitution or similar document that formalizes how they are supposed to do, and what they are supposed to do, anything that is attempted in the meantime will be a catastrophe of confusion. before they can address issues, the csm desperately needs to adopt a founding document such as this.i would be more than happy to provide them with a .doc/.rtf copy for easier reading.----- ----- ----- ----- -----constitution for the council of stellar management(10 june 2008)article 1: name and purposesection 1: name the name of the organization established by this document shall be council of stellar management, to be abbreviated as csm.section 2: purposea. the purpose of this constitution is to establish the form, function and procedures for the csm, as well as any organization created by or for the csm.b. the purposes of the csm are:i. to identify the issues of greatest interest or concern to the players of eve online, who shall be referred to as the populace.ii. to evaluate the issues for their impact on and value to the populace.iii. to ensure that the ccp council is aware of the most important issues to the populace, the level of their importance, and their merits."

"so are you in favour of removing the apotheosis shuttle from the game? after all, you can no longer acquire it. how about the rare skills mfo, mro, sdo, and ae? those are similarly unobtainable. and let's not even get into the unique ships. none of them are obtainable in-game today, two of them are useful for something other than bragging rights, and one class of them is far and away better than any other battleships in existence."
"all the loudmouths who are screaming for the removal of the t2 bpos from the game... how about going here to this thread t2 bpos the future: dev blog needed and posting your support for a simple devblog that will nip this in the bud once and for all? hu?i own t2 bpo and i want to hear what the developers actually have to say on the issue? or are you all only good for screaming and yelling on the forums and are afraid to actually ask for answers, i am not... so show some guts, and ask for them...."
"sorry but no the argument against t2 bpo's is as valid as a bpo holder saying take invention out of the game because it devalues my assets .the simple truth is that invention in most cases is often done wrong and quite poorly by those who engage in it . while some inventors churn out 3bill a month easy some make very little because they invent low demand/high competion items constantly having to fight price wars and drop their sell orders to get their return faster .many threads have bee posted on this topic never has one conclusive argument against the existence of t2 bpo's been made . remember invention came along to reduce and normalize prices on t2 items for the sake of the consumer it is not meant to be a insta wealth generator . if t2 bposs were removed and invention became a higher proft margin enterprise it would become flooded by the mee too crowd and in the end your profits would be bled off by competition and would in the end mirror the profitability of t-1 manufacturing . an inventor has the advantage of volume by being able with a properly funded and laid out production model to out produce the t-2 bpo holder and therefore place on more markets simultaneaously . where as the bpo holder is limited to a single output . if anything the advantage lies with the inventor as long as he isn't working piecemeal and is focused on long term sucess . i would suggest you invest your time and energy on reseaching product placement and and production optimisation . but that would involve effort and dedication on your part and tbh that not why this thread was posted . because it's obvious that work is exactly what your trying to avoid ."
"i know this is just going to be ignored by anyone who disagrees, but t2 bpos aren't competing with invention, other inventors are. t2 bpos do not produce enough, that's why t2 prices were so high before invention, inventors flooded on to the scene, dropping prices competing with each other, t2 bpo owners probably make more profit per ship but a good inventor has much more volume possible and flexibility to shift products if their current project loses profitabilityif all t2 bpos where removed right now the market wouldn't be changed at all"
"t2 bpo's are fine, over 95% of them have switched hands countless times already.not signed."
"this is just one of the many things stopping newer players from integrating into the current eve universe.make them into 100run bpcs or something instead."
"actually if the newer players make multi billions of isk they can buy a t2 bpo just like most of the currant holders had to do."
"only if the current holders want to sell them."
"current. also, life isn't fair, but the game always needs to balanced. ccp has never refrained from changing ships because of peoples investments into them. there is no reason to not extend that to other assets(nor have they ever not extended that into other assets). there needs to be a sound reason for keeping these assets in the game which give a significant advantage to the old guard which is unnecessary and against the spirit of eve, regardless of who currently owns them."
"that is the attitude of a nerfit hound.there needs to be a very good reason to nerf summat not the other way around. 1. the price drop on t2 items ppl are complaining about has come from invention not from bpo's. 2. the t2 market will not rise in price just because bpo's have been removed so this entire idea is about jealousy and how others can make slightly higher profits and anybody who thinks differently is a fool or a liar.3. bpo holders sell them on occasion giving those who had the wisdom and foresight to build investment capital the chance to gain one."
"warning, wall of text aheadthe problem with t2 bpos is not related at all to how profitable it may or may not be to own them. as i see it, the concept has two inherent problems which act to restrict the ability of a new player to integrate into the eve community.the first and largest problem in my opinion is that the very existence of t2 bpos acts as an unfair barrier to entry into the t2 marketplace. as it stands now, a new player attempting to enter the market has to either purchase a bpc with a limited number of runs or invent the relevant bpc themselves. due to the nature of invention, there is a significant amount of isk and time that must be expended in order to enter the market.on the other hand, those few who were playing the game back when the t2 lottery was in play simply ran a few missions, and were rewarded with free entry into the marketplace. if the lottery was still in place, this would be less of an issue as it would still be possible to gain the advantage that the older players possess. but instead, we have a limited number of unlimited run blueprints held by those who were around back in 2004 competing with newer players who have to constantly invest new capital in order to remain in the marketplace. this is inherently unfair, and it is irrelevant that the bpos are traded: they should not exist in the first place.the second problem comes from a lack of continuity in policy behind the eve marketplace. the developers have been working to remove their influence on the market for some time now, as best seen with the gradual removal of most npc-seeded items. their policy appears to be that, if it can be produced by the players, let the players produce it. this cannot be done with t2 bpos. i cannot go and make more of them, even though they unduly influence an item that is produced by the player base. this is an issue that has to be dealt with.now, how to compensate those holding the bpos is fairly simple. because the bpos do get traded from time to time, give bpo holders a multi-run bpc of whatever item they have, plus an amount of isk to compensate for the loss of the bpo. ccp would be, in essence, buying out the bpo holders.tl;dr - t2 bpos act as a barrier to entry into the market and do not follow ccps current actions regarding the market, both points serve to discourage new players from integrating into the eve community."
"an older player without any bpo's has to buy into the market as well buddy just like he needs or needed to train skills or earn isk for ships this is not a eve age issue at all. wrongjust because ppl have been playing longer does not mean they have access to t2 bpo's or the market. ive been playing since 2003 and i do not have a t2 bpo or a t1 for that matter unless it drops from somebody wreck."
"how is it not an age issue? the older players had a chance to get t2 bpos via the lottery, newer players do not. the supply of t2 bpos is limited by this, and such a restriction only benefits older players who hold the bpos or can afford to purchase the bpos. newer players can either sell gtcs in the hope of getting enough isk to buy one of a limited number of gtcs, or go without."
"your idea of content and rational argument has not changed much has it.go away."
"what about older players who were not carebear mission runners?, they (i) are in the same boat as the newer players. as i said this is not about age its about jealousy and bitterness, as nothing will change if bpo's get removed other than nobody ever young or old will get a chance to own one."
"something needs to be done to level the playing field."
"the first thing that invention did was crash the t2 market prices, this was not the bpo holders or the buyers it was the sellers undercutting each other. now a bpo holder may be able to make a bit more profit that a inventor but thats it and its not effecting the inventors one bit unless you count envy and thats no reason to remove summat."
"their presence in the game only stands to benefit the few who currently possess them. all other players, young or old, are affected by this. however, the opportunity to own them was only available to the older players. the capital needed to purchase them is only available (without selling gtcs) to the older players. why shouldn't the bpos be removed from the game is the better question.i'm not saying that ccp should simply delete all the t2 bpos from the owners' hangars, they should be properly compensated. however, the bpos give a distinct competitive advantage to those players who were around when they were being offered and decided to enter the lottery. the lottery itself was unfair, and the invention system is a better way of handling t2 items. why not complete the transition?"
"why remove them and stop younger or older players from ever owning a t2 bpo as these players may not stay poor forever and young players do get older and richer over time.t2 bpo's do nothing to reduce the profit of inventors as the inventors themselves have already crashed the market prices of t2 items in their haste to make quick profits.the only thing removing them would serve is to satisfy the jealousy and envy of bitter ppl who have nothing to gain or lose form the removal other than venomous satisfaction."
"the t2 market, before invention, was priced the way it was because there were so few actors in the market. the prices dropped drastically because invention allowed drastically more people to enter the market. more supply + constant demand = lower prices. fairly basic economics.this does not excuse the fact that t2 bpo holders still have a major competitive advantage over those who gain bpcs via invention. their advantage is that they did not have to expend the capital and time in the invention process to gain their bpo. due to the nature of the bpo, they will never have to jump through these hurdles to remain in the market.everyone else must continually invent new bpcs in order to remain in the market. this is, in and of itself, unfair. while, in the long run, the advantage of holding a bpo as opposed to a bpc may be only a few percentage points more of profit, this adds up quickly in the highly competitive market in empire. profit margins are razor-thin as it is, the bpos only serve to make the rich richer."
"exactly, t2 bpo's have had no effect on the profits of inventors these profits have declined due to a now abundance of supply and that is 100% due to invention.total rubbish.before invention ppl were buying t2 products from a few areas and transporting them across empire or into low sec or 0.0 to make profit from the markup they added, now they just invent the stuff themselves to make a profit and save themselves the traveling. another load of rubbish.the market is thin because so many ppl invent and if so many are doing it then it must be profitable. now a bpo holder may be able to make a little more isk per sale but the fact is that he has zero effect at all on the inventors profit margins in the game as they are already saturating the market and would not be doing that if it was not worth it.i do not claim that bpo holders do not have a slight advantage but the fact is that the advantage does not negativity effect inventors in any way so complaining about it is just sour grapes and thats pathetic, petty and non issue as far as a removal is concerned."
"if invention is good enough for me, its good enough for t2 bpo holders."
"thats hardy a good reason to remove summat from the game. and lets face it goons were good enough for you......"
"actually, inventors hold a competitive advantage over bpo holders. inventors can invent and build from multiple bpc at once, so run full factory slots, churning out more product per given time period than a bpo holder. the bpo holder, unless s/he has multiple copies of a bpo, is stuck with a limited production per given time period. over time, the inventor has the edge, since they sell more and hence end up with more iskies, even given slightly lower profit per item. its a volume effect. i know players who have only ever invented and made 10's of bils in a year, more than owning a copy of the bpo would have yeilded in the same time.take care,arithron"
"oh man a joke about my alliance gosh i have been totally wrecked here.it's a perfectly good reason. hell, ccp has changed far more important things for much worse reasons, so it doesn't take much."
"well said bud unfortunately the cry babies never see this or add it into their equations, they only see that the single bpo can mathematical make a cheaper item on occasion. the larger picture eludes them in their haste to run to the forum crying about it."
"i'm against t2 bpos because, much like jade, they are extremely imbalanced and their very existence causes unnecessary conflict."
"t2 bpos should have been removed when invention was released. the fact that they still exist probably proves some ccp devs have a large stash of them that they don't want to give up.t2 bpos are not available to the new player anymore. new players are completely at the mercy of older players if they even wish to purchase one at a ridiculously inflated price. it's dumb and the only people supporting keeping them have private t2 bpos that they have been making money on since the beginning of time. it's time to kill off a bad idea once and for all."
"bpo holders are only limited in their production if and only if they choose to opt out of invention. holding a bpo doesn't prevent them from inventing t2 bpcs. the issue with the bpo comes from the fact that once you get the bpo, you never lose production from it. it tilts the market in favor of the bpo holder because he can play by the same rules as everyone else and come out ahead every single time.a bit of an example to try to clarify my point. we have two producers, both of whom have equal skill in their production and invention skills. both are producing vagabonds. however, one of them has a bpo for this item, while the other does not. this bpo lets him produce 2 in one run. the other player must rely on invention and bpcs, which nets him 2 per bpc.as the second producer can have many bpcs in production, you may think that he has the comparative advantage. he can produce many more vagabonds than his competitor with the bpo can. using only his bpo, he can only produce 2 vagabonds in the same time the inventor can produce 2*x vagabonds. x is the number of bpcs he successfully invents.but wait, why can't the bpo holder also use invention to get vagabond bpcs as well? he can put in just as much effort as the inventor, yet he will always be able to produce more than the person without the bpo. he changes the formula from 2 versus 2*x to 2+(2*x), bpo + bpcs, versus simply 2*x. the bpo holder always wins in this scenario, unless he gets lazy.that is why it is an unfair competitive advantage, and that is why the bpos need to be removed from the game."
"there is no competitive advantage to owning a bpo as they do not reduce the profit of inventors at all. the difference between the two builders profit in your example is utterly insignificant when you consider the scale on which you are trying to apply it. yes the bpo holder can make slightly more profit but in no way do bpo's reduce the profits that a inventor can make so to remove them out of spite cos a few ppl who invested billions to buy them can do so is a petty and pathetic act of jealousy."
"old players have an unfair advantage? well that's nothing new. they have more sp, more isk, more blueprints, more of everything, but that's how eve works.i never won any bpo on the lottery so i'm not saying this to save my own skin, it's simply a fact about eve, it's not fair.that said i wouldn't mind if there was a few more bpo added to even things out. maybe a really small chance of getting one when inventing a bpc, i just don't think it's going to happen."
"a producer who holds a bpo has, by definition, a competitive advantage over the non-bpo holding producer.the value-creating position here is that pesky t2 bpo. the holder of said bpo will always have an advantage, no matter how slight, over anyone who doesnt. the manner in which they were given out was somewhat arbitrary as i understand it, and this process went out the door when invention was introduced into the game. what we have now is a source of guaranteed income for those who happen to possess a t2 bpo. yes, one can spend an inordinate amount of money to purchase a t2 bpo. well, not inordinate, but actually the total lifetime value of possessing the bpo, but thats just going back into intermediate microeconomics for me, and i really dont want to go there right now. anyways, the scale of the advantage created by holding the t2 bpo is completely irrelevant. they serve only to destabilize the market in favor of those who were either lucky enough to earn one via the lottery or had the resources available to purchase one. the invention system was designed to make the bpos irrelevant, and i will agree that it largely has. why not eliminate the final vestige of the t2 lottery? it only serves to benefit a few. i am not suggesting that those people with the bpos should simply lose them. they should be compensated for the value of the bpo. they should not, however, continue to hold onto said bpo. ccp is currently attempting to render as much control of the market as possible over to the player base, and the t2 bpo is one final aspect of developer interference on the market that should be done away with. this is not a petty and pathetic act of jealousy. this is basic economic theory . . . i have not broken new ground in advocating against outside interference in the marketplace. yes, holders of the bpos have gained from this interference. no, they arent responsible for the interference in the first place. no, they should not be punished for their gains. yes, they should be compensated in full for the loss of the bpo.if the holders of the bpos really benefit as little as is claimed from their possessions, then why do they sell for so much isk? why wouldnt they be willing to give them up. as has been claimed in this thread, there is no real benefit from hanging on to them. so why not get rid of them?"
"we all know about jita and how crowded it is. this is a proposal on how to at least decrease the traffic congestion.irl a lot of cities have ring roads, roads that go around the city like a ring to help prevent congestion in the city.the problem with jita is that if you're traveling in caldari space you have to pass through jita weather you want to or not to reach a lot of places. i would gladly jump an extra jump around jita than having to jump into jita.there are enough people who have business in jita, no need to further increase traffic by forcing people to pass through a choke point when they don't need to.this would not change that jita is the de-facto center of the universe, jita would still be jita, but at least those who don't want to go into jita could go around it.jump connections are added and taken away in patches (were some changes to the recent patch) so it could certainly be done.thank you for your time."
"the agents for fw should give missions much more in line with their supposed divisions, unlike regular corp agents. but all the agents seem to be giving is kill missions over long distances. it would be nice to see these new missions be a bit more focused toward player skill specializations. so things like a surveillance agent giving a job for a cove ops to do a scan, and bring back important intel. or flying a stealth bomber to deliver a special payload. or just something that is a bit more removed from straight combat, and ship fitting juggling. or missions for blockade runners in transport ships and the like.i just think with how much it takes to win a war, outside of battles and combat, such as intell / counter intell and logistics, fw can reflect that with it's missions."
"supported.can just see it now, going to a high-sec logistics agent to be told\"we need 50 200mm autocannons delivered to x system, y station asap. i don't care how you get them or where you get them, just get them there!\"mission reward: x faction points (towards control in the low-sec destination system)bonus: 1,000,000 iskedit: perhaps a good idea might be to only generate a certain number of these supply runs per day , however if the supply runs are failing to get through to the destination system then the faction that is being supplied will begin to lose ground in the system.so, to maintain your momentum in a given system you need to organise the supply runs carefully otherwise, you may be winning the battles in the system but not winning the war as vital supplies won't be getting through."

"i disagree anthony. from what i have seen i am fairly confidant that had a goon been voted in as chair the same problem would be present, and there would possibly be more of a cry for removal for the simple fact that goons have a reputation. there would be a committee arguing about procedure with no time to actually do so. whoever the chair was, be it a goon or not, would be stepping in and doing what they feel was needed in order to keep the meeting on track, or in the case of the end of meeting 3 what was needed to end the meeting with everything clear. however in terms of actual game issues i don't think anything would be different."
"jf & rp partisans supporting their own thread instead of my more elegant and parsimonious proposal. shameful.shameful."
"that's pretty much what i said. i support \"no confidence\" votes, and i think they're important in any democratically-elected body."
"oh hey, a star fraction post in support of jade constantine."
"there is already a mechanic for this. at the end of the term, if you dont like your csms or chairperson, you elect not to elect them again."
"there will never be a formal no-confidence mechanic on the csm. the closest you will get to this will be an electable chair where you might be able to harangue a sitting chair to stand again for re-election mid term. for good or ill we are stuck with the csm reps elected this time around and the first opportunity the eve electorate will have to remove those chosen will be the vote for the next session in the autumn. the sooner this sinks in the sooner we'll have this assembly hall back for serious issues rather than spurious muck-hurling."
"is there a list you could provide the public with other mechanics/votes that you will not allow, a lot of ideas being thrown around here and most of them are null and void and nobody realizes it."
"well it's a good thing you elected us to be the voters so you can have no confidence in your choice. ohwai-"
"when was this voted on? did i miss reading one of the csm meetings?"
"i think people would drop all of this if you would just admit to getting carried away and promise not to do so in the future. a sign of a trustworthy person is their willingness to admit their own mistakes. stop being such a **** up.also as someone who doesn't believe this council will actually effect the game in any way regardless, you are further ruining it's chances by playing king of a meaningless little castle."
"the purpose of a chairman is to direct meetings in an orderly fashion, and act as an informal representative of the body as a whole. you instead have chosen to be an arbiter, taking your scant majority as a mandate to act as a decider, and to hold power over the other members of the council. everybody wants to start talking about game issues, but your pathetic and power-hungry attempts to control the debate have paralyzed the body."
"i am intrigued to know upon what you base your authority to declare what the elected representatives of the players may and may not discuss.i can't remember the bit in the csm document where you were given the power to rule by fiat.while your soap-opera-meltdown and blatant malfeasance is pretty hilarious, you are an obstacle to getting sensible improvements in the game brought to the attention of the devs."
"i would ask you to read my post again. i voiced no support of any council member in paticular. in fact a large portion of my post was intended to give people some perspective on the goons. to shed some positive light on the goons who are on the council. so i think you misenturpret my sentament. if i could restate your words accuratly i would state the folowting. \"oh hey, a star fraction post in support of individuals in goonswarm\" has a slightly differen ring to it eh? as far as jade constantine is concerned, i do not feel that everything jade has done in council chambers is in line with the way i would have run things. jade made statements in meeting 3 that i see as emotionally driven and counterproductive to the process. this however is something that every one of the council members have done. this is something that anyone in their position, be it chair or member, would have done. honestly i am amased that it hasnt happened more. this is a testament to the stregnth of our council and the dedication they are putting forward. josiah. do not let your pettyness and simplicity get in the way of rational thought. jade is doing the things nessesary to keep this council on track. for the record, i take no issue with jade's use of muting. oh and before you call this post a star fraction post in support of jade constantine, let me make this as clear as it can be. i am an individual. i support the entire council."
"hmm, posted by a star fraction member. did jade ask for backup?"
"/facepalm"
"bad idea, +5 is bad enough. expensive implants are keeping people in high-sec because they are afraid of loosing them and no way a new player can afford +6 or +7."
"i would love +6's!! i approve this thread!!"
"zoing. looks like this is in the wrong forum. can a moderator move this to the correct one?[issue] that standing orders, and constitutional makeup,are to be discussed at the next available meeting.formal reading of this proposal. this is a single issue document that requests consideration of formal standing rules, and a consideration of issues brought up by the \"constitution\" (in absense of formal constitution, read"
"addendum to issue discussion points.on rereading the minutes, some issues have already been aparently resolved. feel free to discard points if they have been formally resolved to majority council satisfaction."
"please add to the discussion, what is the formal quorum for a meeting and for a decision ie how many abstains make the issue unresolved, noting the conventional interpretation of an \"abstain\" as meaning \"i neither support or dissent\". the conventional wisdom of the interaction of an abstain with a majority is;- (majority = number of ayes /( membership count - abstains ))> 0.5 where ((membership count - abstains) > quorum). is this the formula being to be used, or will the council invent a new formula?"
"heres a draft of what a standing orders document might look like;-----------------------------------------------------------standing orders for the procession of csm meetings.orders conatained within the ccp scope document.1) that the attendance quorum be 7 members2) that an issue must be available for comment for 7 days prior to the meeting, and be aproved by either 5% of player base, or a member of the csm3) that an issue may remain as long as necesary to obtain either approval or disaproval. an approved issue must be escalated to ccp4) aproval takes the form of a simple majority for an issue to pass, ayes must outnumber naes. an abstain is not counted as a nae*1. (add others as deduced from the document)voted on standing orders:5) an alternative candidate may start participating at the point a candidate becomes absent, and must yield when the candidate returns.*2(add others as needed)ideas for standing orders:6) at any point a csm member can propose a vote on an issue of standing orders. this vote halts the progress of the meeting, which does not proceed till the issue is resolved. the chair is compelled to follow the vote. (this is pretty standard stuff with meetings)7) any move to mute a member must be subject to a simple majority vote, which would include the proposed mutee. the mutee must be permitted to address the motion. (strike suggestion 8, it contradicts simple majority by implying absolute)suggestion on meeting protocol:during a meeting, for someone to take the floor they should say something like \"floor\" or even an \"x\". they go onto a queue and take turns as per the queue.if a person wants to directly address a point, they should say something like \"addressing <person name>\". they are put onto the top of the queue after the current speaker. this must only be used to address a specific persons comments (for instance to correct a mistake), anything else is outside of process. for the purpose of decorum, other members must be addressed via the chair (for instance , instead of \"darius, i think xyz you jerk!\" you might say \"chair, i submit that i disagree with darius and think xyz\") addresses to the chair however might be addressed directly to the council \"council, i submit the chair is incorrect on this matter, for reasons xyz\".a motion on meeting procedure, constitutional matters, or standing issues however interupts the current meeting, and thus takes precedent even over the current floor speaker. (ie \"objection, chair, xyz is speaking outside the scope. i vote we move on\", a vote then ensues). when a speaker has finished , he should indicate with an \"end\" or something like that.*1 note, in formal terms a simple majority is defined as a vote where more ayes are recorded than nayes. an abstain does not count as a nae. where an abstain is called a nae, this is refered to as \"absolute majority\". ccp states clearly, this is not the case. this would appear to resolve the issue of the status of abstain votes.*2 unresolved. the principles of simple majority state that a vote can be reversed in the agregate positive. this would imply a member can revert the vote of an alternative, but its a bit ambiguous. does the csm agree?-----------------------------------------you'd have to fill in the blanks and reorganise it, but i think the above would pretty much satisfy everyone. think about it csm reps. something like the above would be a pretty classy framework thats based on traditional meeting procedure, and address everyones concerns (particularly regarding orderly meeting behavior, and it would permit the chair to exercise his role, whilst allowing the csm members a mechanism to reject a chairs ruling)"
"look a all dem posts and words."
"moved to assembly hall."
"cool with that."
"thanks mitnal. its a bit embarassing to do all them words and then screw it up by posting it in the wrong forum . please take the time to read what i've writen. i believe it neatly solves the current problems with the council by making the chair accountable to the membership whilst providing a mandate for the chair to function."
"personally i think having the csm ask ccp to actually do what they should have done from day one and write the csm a proper set of cast iron procedural rules rather than turning over yet another session of the csm to this. a csm that votes itself power only leads to power block voting and disperate factions within the csm fighting each other for control which is something i don't believe ccp wanted particularly."
"i've drafted a basic constitution for the council of stellar management based on the ccp proposal pdf and placed it in an independant thread."
"i have the feeling this will be resolved some other way, but good work on drafting these sorts of things guys, it looks nicely organized and it would be great if there were some recognized order to follow.although like heartstone said, i'd think that would need to come from ccp to be viewed as authoritative. thumbs up nonetheless!"
"dippins, theres some excelent ideas in there. i think we need to keep the proposal simple, and basically dependant on the original documents.what we have o work with is pretty simple1) simple majority voting. a very specific idea. look it up on wikipedia.2) a limited scope.3) a very loose mandate of how the council works. now by my reckoning, that means what is needed is more a concept of how a meeting should run, such that we keep a sense of civility between the diferent personalities, and such that two objectives can be meta) jades responsibility to keep the council orderly andb) the councils right to full unimpeded rights to speechit would seem the reason (a) and (b) conflict is a lack of standing orderergo what we need is a standing orders document thats simple, comprehensible, with minimal scope for conflicting interpretaion but most importantly a canonical document to refer procedural debates to.jades job should be mechanical and predictable. if any member can not work out if an action is permisable, then something is wrong. jade must thus make a call , and nobody is to blame if they disagree. if this occurs, something is wrong with the procedure."
"i agree in principle, but in practicality, the csm has been formed with no real standing orders. its not unusual, as a public servant i see it all the time. but honestly experience says get this **** out of the way first, and it'll never be a problem again. this council experiences pain so the following ones have a clear mandate. what we used to do in my days on the local council was make sure a lawyer had ratified standing orders so we didn't need to (prior to committee forming). but this hasn't happened here, so i guess we gotta do it ourself.please take this seriously guys. it'll save heartache later on."
"wonderfull. having something like this from the beginning would have made this run alot smoother. we didnt have this so its good to make it."
"tldr after the first post, but what i read was good."
"this forum was never intended to be a replacement for the features and ideas forum. all the topics in this forum are faling on deaf ears. the csm are the only forum members that should have \"start new topic\" rights in this assembly hall\" forum. everyone else should have reply to topic permissions.this whole \"assembly hall\" forum needs the vast majority of its topics deleted and the permission masks set."
"yes this would be a great idea alt. only the people who can silence people should be able to start topics and by extension vote on them - a majority of 1 if you will.idiot."
"actually, no, it shouldn't. this is where the people represented by the csm make formal requests/proposals for them to consider.it's like going to a town council meeting to present a petition or w/e to the council members. in the case of eve, if we actually attended one of their meetings it would get flooded with so many lines of text in chat it would be impossible to read for the council (or anyone else for that matter)."
"a pointless and pathetic post. idiot.i can see your point but this is quintessential for a rethink for this forum since this forum is clustered with threads we all know should belong in features and ideas. the csm should pick ideas that have already been discussed and then open a debate in this forum."
"but the (widely presumed, because there is nothing official currently) role of the csm is to identify the topics of greatest interst/importance to the community and ensure that ccp is aware of the issue and its merits. much like a lobyist. ccp is perfectly capable of figuring it out for themselves, the representatives just throw themselves in the line of fire to make sure the message is getting across."
"isn't this reason for the csm to pick topics on these forums and then start the debate here?"
"no, here's a quote on the function of this forum, i'll highlight the most pertinent section ...ccp has established how they want the csm to present issues to them as well. in two reports and a face-to-face presentation, all delivered by the csm."
"thank you for that quote. i have bolded a pertinent point. as we can see that many of the topics presented on this forum are clearly not relevant since they should be directed the features and ideas forum this should be reason for a moderator to at redirect many of the threads that have been started.this isnt something that can be regulated easily if at all."
"features and ideas can be important issues too."
"yes and many topics on this forum should be moved to \"features and ideas\" to be hammered out before bringing them to this forum."
"there's actually supposed to also be a \"resolved for debate\" area or something like that where issues that have been passed by the council go for further player discussion - it's mentioned in the longer csm document, but i guess that one never made it into practice."
"disagree with op, but this:is good stuff."
"i propose the council immediately back jade as emperor for life. jade clearly has will and strength to rule and he doesnt take crap from any one. i propose the council promote our chairman to emperor, with a life term. the charter does not prevent this! we must give our strength to this great man as soon as possible!ccp should also build a new jovian titan class ship, call it an an executor, and make it the floating home of our new galactic emperor jade."
"you have to post again to support your own topic."
"is this the sarcasm thread?? im in"
"sounds good to me. can i have a secret order of latex nun shock troops to assassinate my political enemies while they sleep as well please?"
"dohl is right, and this idea is brilliant. you should all back it."
"once we commit you as emperor life the power will be unimaginable jade"
"as with all born and raised europeans, i feel we need to consolidate as much power as possible to in to a single person. doing this only greases the wheels of the democratic process. i support this."
"well, now that the op has supported his own topic, we've got at least one european on board, and the person to be named emperor has indicated they would accept...full support."
"i see you've got an idea for your next s&m roleplay ready to go."
"definately supported.now that is out of the way, can someone give me a lift to the tashi station so i can pick up some power converters?"
"you have to stay for the harvest, sorry oz."
"supported, as long as anyone can mute him."
"not supported, because palpatine kicked samuel l. jackson's ass. and no mere mortal can kick samuel l. jackson's ass, not even chuck norris."
"but uncle kelsin, all my friends will be there..."
"wow does this thread suck."
"will support if jade goes -10...even for just an hour..."
"only if jade can prove himself by getting the monster truck issue through."
"technically the csm can only make suggestions to ccp, though i guess if you could get ccp to agree that all titans needed to be changed to look like monster trucks you would probably deserve the chair for life."
"i guess the star fraction will be getting a few war decc's in the days to come who are they anyway?"
"fingers crossed, i'd love to think chairing the csm would get us free wardecs - my corp would love it"
"t h e e x e c u t o r"
"csm procedure is not a valid issue here. if by the fourth meeting it isn't crystal clear that even token discussion is more valid than the vicissitudes of backup voting, re-electing csm chairs after election and other waffle, then your suggestions are meaningless anyway. gameplay issues or get out."
"i'll support this, with two caveats. one, any csm issues that actually need to go to ccp - e.g., changing the 5% rule - should still be here. two, all the other stuff should still be encouraged on jita park. these are legitimate issues, they're just in the wrong place."
"i disagree. herschelthese issues are important to the overall efficiency of the csm. think of procedural issues as learning skills.they don't do anything directly useful for the game initially but they make all other meetings more efficient. thus in the long term more gets done. and like learning skills these things should be done at the beginning (while still doing enough that effects the game).again these issues are important and need to be discussed by the committee. this is the place where we can show support for procedure."
"problem spotted"
"i'm hardly against procedural issues - on the contrary, i feel like i've spent the last three days talking nothing but procedure here. i just don't think assembly hall is the right place for them, since they're not petitions to ccp. they're petitions to the csm in their own right, and as such they should go in jita park, which has become the de facto \"csm business\" forum since the campaign finished."
"a procedural thread was just moved to this section of the forums by a mod. strange, huh."
"this indicates the mods suffer from the same fundamental lack of understanding as to what the csm is and what this forum is for as the players do, it does not indicate that my point is invalid."
"no need for all these changes to mwds,webs, and ws, just add mid range weapons that can do slighty less damage then short range, but has a better rof then long range"
"first off i am going to say that medium ranged combat is fairly common. especially with the proliferation of hacs and the locus rig bug the most powerful ships for most all types of small to medium gang combat are high dps medium ranged ships.it doesn't exist everywhere. it doesn't exist in empire and low-sec due to gate guns. but it certainly does exist in 0.0second off i am going to reply to thisthat is the entire point. smaller ships being effected by longer range webs worse encourages smaller ships to get closer to larger targets rather than farther away. that is to say you have an advantage in getting into situations where you cannot as easily run away rather than having an advantage in staying in situations where you can easily run away. doing something like changing webs in the proposed ways however is probably something that should not be done yet, if its done at all. its a huge change to the game and would mean massive upheavals in optimal fittings. that might not be a bad thing because everyone loves theory crafting. but it is also something that would need to be tested throughly because figuring out all the interactions we would be looking at would simply be too difficult without testing it out and tweaking it to be right. and getting it right is better than ruining an entire style of combat which by ccps record won't be fixed for 1-2 years.furthermore i do not trust the current csm to give any such topic the required community discussion regarding the disadvantages and advantages that it would need to be properly refined with both reservations and purpose"
"his suggestion of requiring a non-npc corp to use barges/exhumers is meant to deter macro miners. i can see how you would think it would be a nerf though.aside from that, what other things would be a \"nerf\"? new types of ore would be nice, system wide roid fields would be awesome (more to mine), and roid fields to scan down mean you could have more valuable ore in the fields that not everybody could find."
"loot ownership is stupid. whoever loots it should get it. a great way for newbies to build up assets is to go around stealing loot, and i think it should be encouraged."
"tier 2 m8, not tech 2. meaning not much higher in cost, a tiny bit more training (eg. requires lvl 3 of the skill instead of lvl 1--but who only trains dread to 1?) kinda like tier 1 is dominix, tier 2 is megathron, tier 3 is hyperion. tech 2 is kinda out of the question due to what you just stated."
"yeah it is true darius. your overt attempts to play politics with the council and vote away powers and positions you don't like is a big part of me realizing that any csm involving this sort of personality mix cannot be allowed to change its own constitution in a significant way. some of us are trying to make the process work - you're out there playing junta for the fun of trying to fix the system again. well consider me convinced, i've learned that we are going to have to stick to player-submitted issues only since any sniff of changing the constitution is going to have your trying to vote yourself increased holidays and tin stars to differentiate you from the alternates. ultimately whatever, you don't like me darius, i don't like you. we represent opposite sides of this game from the ground up, we can cast votes on gameplay issues - we can't however be trusted to make collective decisions about the csm process in and of itself. still, at least we got some good issues on the table. got to look on the bright side."
"its fortunate the chair isn't given the power to make such decisions."
"it's like each time your defense fails you just reach into a grab bag of excuses, cross your fingers, and throw it out there hoping it'll stick."
"the difference being one of us plays by the rules as established and one throws a temper tantrum and insinuates that they can change them by dictatorial fiat whenever they realize they'll lose. game hasn't changed for me. it's now officially gone from a council to the jade constantine hour. congrats!"
"who are you to state my motives? i want this csm thing to work and find it abhorrent that jade is abusing the process at every turn. it doesn't matter if jade did what he thought was appropriate. that is the entire point. what jade did was not appropriate.everyone on the other side of the issue is looking for a resolution. the problem is that they are not looking for the resolution that jade wants because the resolution that jade wants involves creating powers out of thin air and letting jade run roughshod over the rights of all council members.hell jade even says it in flat language for us, \"i assure you i have every intention of being the very best representative i can be for those players that voted for my manifesto and want the kind of eve i talked about there.\"there is another one here on this board where she flatly refuses to deal with anyone who doesn't agree with her."
"you haven't seen me lose my temper darius old boy. cheer up, at least we'll get some decent issues through. you should actually drop kelsin a line about that 0.0 sovereignty re-vamp, he might be able to help you with the write up."
"you were clearly in control in the meeting according to the logs, and the requisite email tantrums. i'm afraid much like your inability to admit any fault whatsoever or wrongdoing, you also do not recognize when you are losing your cool. f13.net ring any bells? that whole conversation looks familiar for some reason... perhaps because it's every single one you have. if you're cool with ccp allowing this to turn into a joke (and by joke i mean your continued attempts at lordship) i'm sure everyone else will enjoy their trips to iceland to learn about icelandic democracy."
"dear god jade is mad. he's abolished the senate and declared martial law. the chinese are invading. isanity"
"and my dog died and my time was stolen and my gf left and my house burned down (and 100 over terrible things the goons seem to think). makes you think doesn't it, maybe internet spaceships really are serious business"
"yes we have"
"jade please post the emails you sent to the other csms including their subject line so that everyone can see how you were calm and collected at all times"
"fly away troll"
"who is kelsin?"
"one of jade's cronies. its ironic because sf actually doesn't hold sovereignty anywhere while darius' corp/alliance holds huge amounts of space."
"the guy who thinks we should have sovereignty by sitting on gates. another one of jades blind followers.this guy"
"wow. i just read that thread, and it is possibly the worst idea i have ever heard regarding potential sov changes. it can't be serious."
"ya...unless this guy has some alts or something, a guy playing less than a year in a empire corp really isn't going to know what's going on is he? jade are you trolling darius or something?i've lived in 0.0 for a year now, and i'm still hazy on some of the issues."
"star fraction are pretty keen on changing sov mechanics, as clearly they are the only thing holding star fraction back from becoming the mighty pvp empire they obviously deserve to be"
"they would obviously be the next gs/ra/tcf/bob/aaa if only they weren't being held back by current sov mechanics. it has nothing at all to do with who they are. right?"
"so basically you withdraw that statement? i wonder how even your own corpmates can stand behind such an obvious liar. they should be ashamed."
"i think they are alt's not corpmates."
"hi.i expect darius has plenty of ideas for writing up how to pitch it to ccp but simple though the actual topic is, if for some reason he's into collaborating, i'm up for it.and...broken record...while capturing stargates is an interesting jumping off point for a wild revamp of sovereignty, that's not what darius is writing up...and he already knows that...etc etc.i love you goons,kelsin"
"you will never get a dramatic change to the sov system like that though ccp anyways they would never spend the time/effort."
"i get why you say that, but...and i've said this a lot recently...ccp nozh actually posted something pretty similar beforehand, and my example was just based off of that. his version is linked in the op of one of those two links goum posted.so my thing was a relatively small variation on something they're already working on - hence the csm proposal to inquire as to how that revamp they're already working on was coming.don't shoot the messenger, i'm fragile."
"sorry if i missed it, but you guys still haven't answered the question many here have asked: why don't you use a forum and instead insist on chat based communication, although it's general consensus that chats are a very inefficient method for the discussion of complex matters, and only get worse the more people are involved.it's really baffeling to me. i know you use forums to manage communication within your respective alliances so why not for the csm.aside from that: haggling about procedural matters is the norm and the exception in politics. as ccp unfortunately hasn't defined a constitution for the csm procedure i'd guess that we will witness some more haggling in the future until the csm decides upon their own constitution.i'd recommend joining your local chapter of the political party of your choice, if you don't believe me, or any other political quasi political organization like a union.like a fellow (rl) party member once told me, after i asked her why so much time is wasted on procedural matters on each meeting: \"procedure is power, my friend. it allows you to define the agenda, and the agenda is the cornerstone of the political process\"."
"when did it change from that to you interpreting the csm documentation and having veto power?"
"they are supposed to use the forum for the discussion threads. but are skirting the line by considering the \"issue\" threads \"adequate discussion\".they are using eve-chat as a communication manner for the meetings because ccp and the csm document require it in order to officially record the meetings(or something, but the point is that they don't have a choice in the latter)"
"when people didn't obey him as their lord and saviour."
"the first time a vote was called to prevent it."
"i'm rather annoyed at the lack of any actual worthwhile discussions on topics.i mean, seriously - saying 'oh, we've got this issue, we'll talk to ccp about it' is bs - discuss the issue, discuss solutions, discuss why it's an issue or don't even bring it up in the first place.extending aggro timer / variable aggro timer was something that had a 2-page thread which did not get any meaningful discussion off csms (and had dissenting voices explaining why aggro timers are fine), and they all said 'aye' without saying why are aggro timers a problem and discussing wether they should be changed. just saying 'aye'... meh.*furthermore, the issues like 'oh, war-decs, let's talk to ccp about war-decs' without discussion wether war-decs are broken, why are war-decs broken, etc, is totally lol.furthermore, people abstaining from votes are just lol. you were not selected to 'not give a damn' - and someone can push an issue (potentially a bad one) further with just one vote since nobody cares about it. don't forget you were elected by the player-base. i assume most people didn't vote so you can say \"i don't give a damn\" about important issues.*jade did a world of discussing in the thread. \"oh, yeah, i support it\" is not a discussion. particularly and specifically not when it's posted by one of the csm guys, and advancing a unpopular topic just because you like it (with a number of other topics far more popular not being discussed) means you're only pushing your personal agenda rather then being a medium for the players to communicate with ccp."
"i think you'll find i expressed an opinion on one of the threads on the topic. \"currently there is a problem with the docking timer being abused by well-tanked battleships (and capitals) being able to engage in combat and then de-aggress and redock to avoid significant counter-attack. this problem was caused by general increase in ship hit points over several incremental patches designed to specifically to lengthen combat while there has been a failure to lengthen re-dock/jump aggression timers by a similar degree. outcome is that station dock range (stargate range) fighting is currently overpowered since in the environment of increased hit points for all ships it becomes too difficult to destroy targets in the limited aggression window. this encourages over-blobbing as the only way to inflict sufficient damage on the target before it docks and has the knock-on effect of discouraging any combat at all.question will ccp development agree this is a problem? and will they commit to increasing dock/redock/gate aggression timers to be in line with general ship hit point buffs since castor? roughly this would involve lengthening timers to 2-3x their current value.additional related question can we have a visual countdown of dock/redock/gate aggression timer on our user interface please?\"in raising the issue document for the iceland agenda several discussions in several threads will be summarized and the decent ideas listed. please don't jump to the conclusion that just because i've typed \"yeah support\" in one of several duplicate threads i haven't made substantive comment in one of them."
"marius duvall said,\"doing 'an andy cruse' became the accepted term for walls of text that sapped your will to live.\"i think most of you know that he was right."
"as a whole, the csm are a waste of time and totally focused on self promotion and private interest and not the best interests of the general eve subscriber.if you read the minutes then you will see that it is nothing but a political power struggle to either replace daytime soups or hype their illusionary position as a decision maker in eve.comments by some members to describe issues like the player base being \"lazy\" when it is obvious that they dont even know about the subject they are talking about is an initial good example.outright rejection of adding any content to the game based on it use in a \"solo\" playstyle obviously shows who you represents pretty clearly.rather then gathering and talking as a group focused on bettering the world of eve, all one has to do is read their minutes and see they are nothing but a publicity stunt (as some have called it though i tried not to believe) or self interest group that has been given license and a personal forum by the eve staff.it is not that hard to just sit down and rationally discuss items that may or may not need ccp's attention. but you cant even do that. you run huge corps but cant stop waisting the time of the general population of eve with your infighting and power mongering long enough to have one sane meeting.one meeting.given your various positions in large guilds i find it hard to believe this is unintentional.many of the csm members are part of an organization that has sworn to actualy destroy eve. your organization, or at least their leaders, have made these statements of their own free will so please dont come here and say otherwise.ruining a route of communication and problem solving directly connected to the player base would seem a good start.and saying that is not what you are up to is like running down the street with a chainsaw saying you were gunna kill everyone and then saying \"i didnt mean it\" when the people dont unlock their doors to let you in.you have been elected.but it can be argued that if the votes were counted up and compared to the player base you represent, then the results would correlate with who was elected pretty well. i am not saying wether it is true or not, but it could be successfully argued given the evidence.you csm members have had several meetings to actually do your jobs and have no proof that you are actually focusing on the needs of the players of eve or that you have done anything to promote their needs, understand their issues or expand the player experience to new players or old.almost every communication between the csm's is a cat fight.the minutes of the csm meetings are childish fights and when issues are discussed it seems most of the csm either dont care, dont want to waste the time on the issue or activily oppose it because of some hidden agenda.you can not have members who have stated they want to destroy the game on a council ment to improve and better it.you can not have leaders of large corps who publicly denounce a viable playstyle also be the people who represent its best interests.the do not represent the general player base.they do not represent the best interests of eve.they do not represent the general eve player, anyone or anything outside their own interests for themselves or their corps.ccp never intended these guys to be either.they dont care about the general player base, only the large subscription blocks.proof:they had allowed these self same corps to use third party programs unmolested but when one of those self same programs gets released to the general public, it is a problem they fix immediately. large corps can use programs that are considered \"wrong\" if the general public uses them. and ccp admitted they have known about it for a while.no, the csm are simply reps of the biggest subscription blocks.not the representative of the general eve player base.not representative of the best interests of \"eveonline\" the game and community.a daytime soup and game."
"crossposting another goonalso, as another goon said \"we dont want to ruin the game, we want to ruin your game\"."
"main post is a mess, but if i'm understanding you correctly your biggest beef is that you feel that the general player base is not being represented properly by people you perceive to be just alliance leaders with their own agendas. is that a decent enough summary?personally i don't care if the whole council was goonswarm, or band of brothers, or my own comrades, as long as they're able to take issues raised in the csm forums which gain popular approval, and take them to ccp. that seems to be the case of what's happening. there are lists of issues that are going to get talked about, and those issues came from the forums.so if there's a failure somewhere of issues reaching their attention, guess who's shoulders that gets laid upon?the real test is how those issues are presented to ccp. if the people being assigned the issues do their job and bone up on the subject at hand and present it not as an opinionated blowhard but as a representative of the community, i'm happy. that's where the real test of the process will occur."
"the key question that council members must consider before casting their vote is whether or not the issue at hand has the potential to improve or otherwise benefit the entire eve society, and not just a select group within the community that was successful in bringing attention to their unique case. seeing the big picturein this case, the needs of a society with over 220.000 individuals is the primary responsibility of a csm representative...from the csm summary paper. nothing wrong with the idea of the csm, so long as they adhere to the structures put in place by ccp. many of the issues fail the italicised part above. many more will fail if the csm council keep considering their job is to just bring numerous issues to the ccp meetings without discussing them fully beforehand in meetings. from the chatlogs, i see little discussion or debate on many of the issues raised. the same could be said for many issues on the forum. i have been urging csm members to look at the structures carefully to make sure they are fully aware of their remit and the structure they work within. i think much of the infighting and confusion stems from stepping outside this remit and a misunderstanding of the purpose of how and what the csm actually is for.bruce hansen"
"to a degree i agree with you white ronin. i did expect some degree of political maneuvering and head-banging in advance, i did see a danger of the appointees of big alliance blocks becoming poor csm's and said as much during the campaign - but i had hoped we'd be able to get by that with some simple decisions on interpretation of csm docs and spend our time discussing the issues. instead it has turned into a straight power-play slug fest with the least and simplest issue of chair moderation launching 1001 threads and sparking the most ridiculous histrionics i've seen in many years on these forums and many csm reps involved in actively stoking the flames rather than showing collective responsibility to the organization's best interests. so i'm now convinced that the csm should not be allowed to re-write the founding rules with its current composition because frankly - i don't trust people involved to make the decisions without self-interest and political bias coloring their votes. in order for us to actually get down the business we were elected to do - actually considering substantive player issues and bringing them to ccp attention we are going to need a full and unambiguous guide to how the council offices work, how the meetings work, how moderation works, what sanctions can exist for handling bad behaviour in meetings. all this stuff is going to need spelling out and underlining in a position document from ccp because at the moment any ambiguity in the process is being seized on by opportunistic forces trying to subvert the process of the council.our biggest failure as a collective body is the way more effort has been put into factional in-fighting on the council than actually reading and casting informed votes on issues. i too was absolutely disappointed with the outcome of the exploration vessel vote white ronin. and its shameful what we spent more time discussing a motion to allow csm reps to come and go in meetings and contradicting the stated role of alternates than we did on supporting a gameplay profession and focus for solo players and people interested in exploration. calling solo players \"lazy\" for not bringing friends was shocking and i'm going to apologize for the fact that happened - it was inappropriate and insulting and is not the kind of language the csm should be using.but i'm going to try to put this right. i've started by making a ruling that all potential changes to the constitution/founding documents must be raised in the form of documented issues and join the queue with the rest for ccp approval. i hope this will stop these things clogging up the beginning of meetings. ank has gone a step further with a motion effectively saying we should agree that we have no say on these changes and ccp must be asked for a ruling on all issues of interpretation/change of the documentation. at the moment though you are right, its a warzone and it has to stop. i would like here and now to call on my fellow csm reps to stop briefing against each other publicly and privately - we shouldn't be fighting over matters of procedure on the forums, and we definitely shouldn't be taking disagreements over meeting moderation to the court of public debate. nothing will come of this except noise and mob stupidity. no good result will arise. all that will be achieved by playing politics at the expense of fellow csm reps will be less time for substantive discussion of gameplay issues. anyone carrying on this behaviour should stop immediately.i still think this can recovered, but yes, we do need to make changes and from this point forward anyone seeking to bring admin/procedural items onto the agenda above player submitted issues needs to be demonstrating clearly how these things are in the interest of the electorate and the general good of the csm."
"this is insane. for you to have the gall to put this on the other members of the council when you have undeniably been proven through the chatlogs to have been one of the two main instigators of csm rulemongering and bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy i simply cannot fathom how you can have such a break with the reality of this situation."
"and so it goes. your side say that, another side says something different. my supporters say that other side has behaved appallingly, the goons say i've behaved appallingly. rules lawyers of both sides go through the chatlogs and interpret things from that, interpretations get challenged, insults get exchanged ... blah blah blah. and so on. reality is nothing will be changed by forum frothing and faux outrage. you are going to have to live with the current csm you have now for another five months. so decide, you're going to flame and troll with the rest for 150 days and then wring your hands wondering why \"its all gone wrong\". or maybe you take some responsibility for your own behaviour too and move onto taking an interest in actual decisions rather than childish temper tantrums and petty political games.grow up. learn to listen rather than simply mash the keyboard with the mob. concentrate on the issues not the political powerplays and maybe you get to have a good influence on matter. and preempting your inevitable mock outrage that i dare to hold you responsible for frothing inanities on this forum ... tough. if think you are posting like a fool i'll tell you that. if you can tell me you look at those chatlogs and claim that one person is responsible for that trainwreck then i'm going to say you are either blind, or have an agenda to wreck this process. either way your input is not helpful to this thread."
"i'm on no side you presumptuous twit, except my own. i'm a low sec pirate with no ties to any entity represented on the csm. i care about the game and i saw the csm as a chance to change it for the better but continue along your merry way with your wrong assumptions and arrogant demeanour. meanwhile, the chatlogs are there for all to see."
"when was this voted on? or should i assume it will be voted on at the next csm meeting?"
"by inferring there is some political powerplay conspiracy you insult any csm that has voted with a goon member, any eve player that voted for said csm, and by justifying your fiat with this nonsense you are destroying the whole proceeding."
"i'm a prophet apparently all i can say is read again, take on the range of 3rd party opinions, read the op post and have a think about this. or better still, get over it. if you are interested in the csm go comment on some actual issues and stop whining about the fact we're in the jerry-springer show while you're the one trying to burst onto the stage chanting \"jerry jerry jerry\"."
"man if everyone would just shut up and agree with me we wouldnt be arguing"
"i am sorry jade, but i have to inform you that reality is in fact objective, and can be measured as such.lord, if everyone would just let me take over the csm and use it to do whatever the hell i want we wouldn't be having a problem. why wont you people just shut up about my flagrant usurpation of power? if it wasn't for you making a fuss about this no one would care!"
"maybe if you actually did what you say i'd have an ounce of respect for you but your hypocrisy knows no bounds. i stopped reading your crap after the first paragraph but continue, you apparently seem to love the attention."
"still bitter your interpretation and lack of reading comprehension is not shared by all the csm's i see. i guess the csm's that voted for this are just ignorant. good thing you overturned it by non-existant means!"
"quotin this as csm fact."
"er...you can't actually do that."
"he is like the vice president he can do anything even shoot someone in the head and not get in trouble for it because he is emperor palpatine ."
"you guys are all hilarious. its politics. real politics. you think that everyone is completely objective at the un? you think people genuinely step away from their country for the betterment of all of the members of the un? hahaha. the council members just haven't learned how to hide their true motives yet. they haven't learned how to smile about one thing while stabbing someone in the back, they just do it openly right now. it's a brand new council. remember.. the first attempt at the un, wilson's league of nations, failed miserably before wwii and had to be completely remade.now i can't say everything is 100% just like real life but it was naive to believe that the council would be completely unbiased. the members will always have their own interests in mind. a good analogy to the situation is the energy crisis. the solution to this crisis would result in the betterment of everyone in the world as a whole. why would agreeing to reduce your country's emmissions be a bad thing? yet at almost every international meeting on the issues staleamtes are reached and no representative ever comes out and says \"this is a f***ing no-brainer! let's save the planet! reduce emissions by 50%!!!\" if that happens the conferences would be 2 minute teleconferences while everyone involved says \"yay to saving the world\". but those conferences last weeks. and most of the time nothing is solved. cutting emissions would reduce industrial output, or cost money to implement emission reducing technology... etc etc. its never so simple as \"lets solve problem x\", yay or nay.\" i'm not shocked that the council is the way it is, it would be inhuman for it to be unbiased. real world experience has shown us that. whining about the situation is like whining about the un. but at least we can read the meeting minutes and laugh because nobody is listening anyways."
"wow you are a pompous little twit. i too feel your not able to conduct yourself. im not a goon im a player. one who you are suposed to rep. keep you goonswarm crap out of the issues i elected you for. your little preschool crap has got to stop. you wanted to have the job. doit and doit rite. not keeping others from a vote not muting others not making snide comments after every vote. others seem to take what there doing with high reguard. your just on some agrophobic pre pubecent power trip. i swear i wish i voted for someone with more maturity. hell goontards would have been better."
"whilst i'm watching you each flame the other here, i do have to ponder the following:i concur that all the csm would be better serving the electorate if they would moderate their tone and act more reasonably, but these public fora are basically the place presently provided. as the quote goes \"there are two things you don't want to see made: sausages and laws.\" well, we aren't making laws but we are certainly trying to sort out policies and procedures which is a close thing, and just as you wouldn't expect our state legislatures to hide away in private i do not believe the csm should either. we were elected in the public eye and should be seen to serve in the public eye. oh, and yes, i include myself in that 'could all do better' piece.but then - after enjoining everyone to create world peace and harmony - you then go and write*again* editorialising a decision of the csm. nobody asked for the ability to \"come and go\", and your re-write to suggest they did is the opposite of \"definitely shouldn't be taking disagreements over meeting moderation to the court of public debate\".iz"
"re the op i must disagree with it in the main. i especially dislike the accusations that:i am primarily a 'solo player' and am very much supporting reasonable moves in this area!\"guilds\" i believe are in some other passtime, but my corp has under ten members (that i've even been online with, anyway) and electus matari is an rp alliance which is certainly not 'large'. i have no \"position\" with either grouping.if this is meant to be describing goons, then there are two of them, of nine members. not really \"many\" by any stretch of the imagination.atually it might surprise people, but the in-game channel is usually a reasonable discussion (out of meetings) and is friendly. generally, in fact, i feel we are friendly towards each other excepting the occasional 'heightened discussion' over some matters which we may not all agree on (yeah, ok, \"cat fight\" might be a bit accurate) and i certainly have no animosity to any of my council colleagues in person at all, whatever happens in csm meetings (or, indeed, in game should i meet them near some dark asteroid!)that the issues presently on the table that we will take *for guaranteed response* from ccp next week are, this time around, ones where there is a high level of general agreement, oth from pilots (on this forum) and within the csm (as i said, not all discussion happens in the meeting itself) so i think we're doing pretty well so far.but thank you for your input.iz"
"i guess by saying \"you\" it means \"us\" right? 1. its not editorializing its a csm representative expressing an opinion as to what was voted on. 2. i didn't say you explicitly \"asked for it\" i said you have voted for the option that allows you to come and go as you please. 3. in my opinion yes, it does contradict the stated role of alternates in the documentation.4. this is not a disagreement over moderation.don't accuse me of re-writing when i'm expressing an honest opinion of what went on and how the vote contradicted the documentation. you seem to think you have free reign to make accusations of the chair editorializing issues and chair bias while simulataneously opposing all notion of chair authority to moderate meetings inanna. obviously we disagree, we will continue to disagree and this argument will continue as long as you choose to sustain it. i have my opinion over what went on. i have my opinion on what was voted for. i have my opinion on the implications of that vote and i have my opinion on how it contradicts the documentation we were supposed to be basing csm processes on. as a result its now my opinion that this csm committee is not an appropriate body to be voting on these procedural issues at the current time and we'd be much better doing as ank suggests and asking ccp for rulings in these cases while we get on with the business we were actually elected to perform - selecting and presenting player issues for the forthcoming summit."
"please re-read the motion which was passed and accepted by the csm. it is quite explicit and does not state \"come and go as you please\". there is no \"opinion\" about that now; the motion had its form of words and was passed in that form of words; it cannot be re-written now (or at least should not).please do not try to put your words* in my mouth. you have editorialised some issues which you should instead now just put behind you and accept the wording the csm agreed, and you have showed bias (cf. many threads and comments on these fora noting that). i do not oppose the chair's authority to moderate meetings; clearly it is a pre-requisite!i do, however, most strongly object that when i ask you to explain your view about something that instead of answering you muted me, and have repeatedly refused (on these forums and on the closed-circulation csm email list) to explain yourself, demanding that i ask you in a private channel only. the csm is a public (fsvo) body and all communication regarding the activities of its members should, therefore, be public.iz* or anything else! ;-p"
"well inanna, for the record i also strongly object that rather than asking the chair and vice chair to clarify the muting decision in a private channel where we could address the issue in a calm and adult fashion you chose to stamp around making accusations and accusing me of lying in a public recorded csm chat and directly sparked this current ridiculous flamewar over the issue of a moderation decision that most sensible people have admitted that the chair of a meeting has the right to make.this was a decision supported by the chair and vice chair. you have also been called out by the general public on the issue in many places here here and here for example. you have never approached me privately and asked for explanation. you have constantly pressed for a public showdown on the issue and are trying to grandstand and stoke up controversy for its own sake. you know perfectly well that there can be no public discussion of csm matters at the moment without extreme goon trolling and you are playing to that crowd. so the only public answer i'm going to give you is the same answer i've given you all along. you were disruptive in the meeting, you were warned several times, in the end i felt i had to mute you in order to get the terms of a vote stated between your increasingly insulting and bad-tempered interruptions. these are matters of public record. people can read the chat logs and don't let the chorus of goons convince you that the public is truly behind you on this issue inanna. at this moment you are the person who will not get over this and its becoming quite obvious you have a chip on your shoulder about csm moderation authority and won't let this go."
"you were mad that you lost the vote, and tried to twist the verbage in your sick little mind to show that 9 adults couldn't agree on menial tasks that ccp asked you to fill in.and you got called out on it, and i hope the other csm's watch for this sunday."
"5th csm meeting: 15th of june 18:00 eve time1. nighthawk needs a powergrid increase (jade)"
"oh, where to put my face. sunday is not a working day."
"from the email discussions there is clearly a difference of opinion between different council members over whether the csm mailing list has ever been 'private'. might i suggest a more neutral term to use for this discussion therefore would be \"this will include the closed-circulation csm mailing list.\"izrelated information:following the start of raising of this topic by darius i stated:i am completely happy with this, including all retrospective emails. inpart, because i had presumed that this use of eve-csm.com was to be a verytemporary measure whilst ccp played catch-up and that we would then eitheruse ccp-provided forum space locked to our use or an email list providinga similar service where ccp would receive copies of all mails anyway.i was elected as a member of the council; as such *all* my activities asthat elected member are subject to public (voter / pilot) scrutiny, andthese emails are no different in that respect.with which a number of other council members have associated themselves whilst others have not commented. this provides part of the background on this topic"
"re item 1, darius' motion - i'm not convinced this is a good idea. in my experience, most committees function far more smoothly when there are informal channels to use in advance of the meeting. you won't hammer out contentious stuff there, but to make sure all the stuff everyone agrees on goes smoothly, a private list that doesn't get seen by anyone else is invaluable, if only because you don't need to worry about keeping up false pretenses. similarly, your private conversations should be sealed, even when they're about csm business. i know darius is our resident anarchist, and i know he'll disagree with me on this, but there's nothing wrong with the occasional back room."
"yeah for the record i think its a terrible idea too and will be opposing it. and if the measure passes i won't be using the csm list for future communications. but we're not talking proposals for \"the good of the csm\" here herschel, we're talking personal power plays and strategies for personal gain and more time wasted on admin wrangling and ego wars between people that dislike each other rather than actually talking about the issues on the agenda. cynical perhaps but there you are. end of the day though he asked for the administrative issue and it had to go on since it doesn't contradict the founding documentation."
"so you want your transparent player council to be translucent or opaque. you are here to serve us and serve us you shall. i dont understand for one moment why you need to have private communications for a player council that is supposed to be submitting player issues to ccp for them to review."
"actually alot of companies doit this way. the \"csm\" is made to rep a sector of the game. however most dont put it to a player vote. most use the devs to make the vote for you. im glad to see it. i think if certain members could growup and realize its a postition out of game character. and there working for all not one allience they seem to have issue with."
"that doesn't make sense from reading the logs. can you corrolate that scenario to the actual minutes of the meeting?are you saying inanna was muted, unmuted-kicked, reinvited didn't say anything, muted, un-muted kicked, and then reinvited?i don't see how someone could be kicked twice in a row through the unmuted system without jumping through hoops."
"look at the minutes and go test it yourself. its not difficult just create a channel and then fiddle with the settings.ed: we can't really go any farther if you doubt my testimony in an easily testable scenario. you have to test it yourself. if you think i am wrong, let me know and let me know why."
"this entire thread clearly shows why you children need parent. chirriba or verone or someone with the ability to enforce the rules who has absolutely no say on the council. i agree completely with adhamhnon."
"really i agree with the player that you quoted. and im not a goon. also when a member asks what the disruption they are getting the warning for. the chair is required to explain why. but not jade. no he has his own agenda to press on. btw does everything with revolve around goon swarm? are you that tunnel visiond that you cant represent those who your charged? everypost and i mean everyone you have to make some sort of goon remark as to make the post against you invalid. news flash kiddo! not everyone in eve is a goon and not all players who post side with you that arent goons. get the clue kid and make it fast."
"no such person exists."
"really? chribba comes to mind off the top of my head. seems a very trustworthy individual, who is completely neutral in the situation. personally i think i'm fairly neutral in this as well, i think everyone's coming across looking like an idiot. if not a community member, what about a ccp representitive who's sole purpose is to keep the peace. seems like they'd have an interest in it as well."
"that's not true i'm sure there are more then a few people who could do such a thing. the real issue is the power of the chair and the rights ccp have given said chair. if you look at roberts rules of order and how the chair is not supposed to come into play into the discussion at all unless he is there to break a tie in the vote and run the agenda. he is not supposed to set said agend only add the items requested of the members. this is the real issue with what's going on jade isn't being a chair he is being a dictator."
"the tl;dr: abandon the csm document. create a simple council forum with no votes, only discussion. there should be no moderation, just the discourse of adults. what follows are an excessive amount of words to justify my beliefs.the council of stellar management, or csm, has collapsed upon itself. the players do not trust it. the council members are trading insults. the leader is embroiled in scandal. ccp has not provided any real guidance on what the csm will entail. if anything, the csm has managed to replicate the power grabbing and squabbling of a third world democracy. the csm document has failed to provide a framework for a functioning council and must be abandoned. if csm document is to be followed to the letter, the meetings at ccp will be a parade of extraneous votes and pointless proclamations, and seems to me to be an impending cluster****.to understand how to fix the csm, we must look at why it was created. the csm was announced in a new york times article after goonswarm had trolled and threadnoughted all confidence away from ccp. the players felt ccp was not listening to them, and ccp felt the players were not listening to their reason. ccp created the csm so that they could communicate with the player base, and so that we could have a say in the way the game runs. this is perhaps the only thing communicated clearly in the csm document. thus, if we should dare to fix the csm, we must remember its function is solely to communicate.the mistake ccp made was giving the council members the pretext of power, by giving them the ability to vote. no csm can implement any idea. no csm can prevent something from being added to the game. the only thing the csm can do is communicate. by giving the csms the right to vote, ccp has given them an artificial power they do not have, and like any group of politicians they are squabbling viciously over every scrap of power they can get. votes split things into a binary issue, and the issues in front of the csms are far more nebulous and unclear than simple yes/no questions. the csms should not try to be game designers and balancers. they should be representatives. imbalances are an issue, but time should not be wasted discussing how much powergrid some ship needs.my solution is simple. strip the csm of the right to power, and any illusion as to such. make the csm a body for communication only and make it clear as such. the only position within them csm should be a council leader, whose job is to moderate as an adult, and ensure that all ideas are discussed and all view points heard. the csms should vote on who they want to be the council leader. there should be no moderation at all, as we have hopefully elected responsible adults, who can function as a body. the removal of the illusion of power should remove the need to bicker so fiercely. there should be no voting, just comments, ideas and questions on the issues discussed. votes make nothing clearer, and only draw artificial lines in the sand. there should be no decisions made by ccp, as any that are made will be pressured and hasty. ccp should not be required to do anything, as any requirements will end up in false promises."
"what follows are the mere details of such an implementation, and should be read by only those that care:i propose a very simple structure: there are a series of 1-2 meetings beforehand where all the csms list every idea they want to discuss. the meetings should take place on team speak, with an irc chat running simultaneously, so while somebody is rambling, others can discuss related stuff with little interruption. all issues raised should be discussed. the middle set of meetings should focus on discussing those issues. each player should be granted a brief period of time (<1 min) to speak on each issue, and then general discussion should ensue for 5-10 minutes unless people want to talk further, which should be determined by a consensus or a quick vote. the last one to two meetings should determine a short list (10-15) of hot button topics for priority in discussing with ccp, and should be sent before hand. i think presentations should be avoided, as much of the content will be dependent on presenter and that seems ripe for bickering. if you guys think you can handle it, then go for it.the visit to iceland should be similar. the first thing that should happen is a tour of ccp, so the csms can understand how game design decisions are made. ccp should then present any issues that they want to discuss, and the players should begin discussion of the hot button issues. powerpoint would probably be useful for ccp at this stage. the next day should be focused on player raised issues. presentation could be made here, but im against them. these discussions require nothing more than water, snacks, and a conference room. if there is time, there should be a break for the csms to have some fun on the third day, and game designers to discuss in private of what they think of the player raised issues. there should then be a final meeting where ccp talks about what they found interesting from the meetings and any final discussion.i think such a format would be simple and easy to follow, and provide a constructive dialog between the players and ccp.to ccp: you guys need to step in and run this thing. there has been a severe lack of leadership, and the council certainly doesnt have a leader they trust. youre the dictators of this sandbox, so if youre going to run a puppet democracy, at least try. step up and provide some direction. everyone is asking for it, including the csms."
"the document is fine, or would be fine if the council wasn't chaired by jade constantinebut it is"
"matin, the document isn't fine. it has serious issues that need fixing, but it's a good basis to work with."
"the vast majority of the document is \"oh hay guyz lets have internet spaceship democracy so the players can participate\", and then has a page and a half of poorly thought out implementation details. the 18 pages of \"democracy is cool\" is fine, but the 1.5 pages are not. it is unsurprising that people have brought up roberts rules of order as a way to run the council, as ccp has attempted to reinvent the wheel with their csm plan, and done so poorly.jade may or may not be part of the problem, but the idea behind ignoring the document is to prevent anyone from having the scraps of power to cause such a fuss. jade's actions are the symptom, not the disease."
"you guys realise that the csm is just a publicity stunt that will suggest a bunch of **** to ccp and ccp will just do whatever they feel like and completely ignore the csm right?"
"as i said, the document would be fine if the chairman wasn't jade. blaming the document is just folk trying to be civil and keep away from a confrontation."
"we is plural. please say \"i\".furthermore, please quote the part of the csm documentation that gives you the power to void votes and veto them. its nice that you're using community outrage to attempt to usurp even more power, but i don't think its going to happen."
"i'll just reiterate:the alternates were elected, and when serving in the place of an absent representative should be treated the same as any other rep. that they can be displaced at a time not of their convenience demonstrates inequality.reading over the documentation about alternates, there's a consistent theme that their substitution is not meant to be taken lightly:i think having them act as placeholders or seat-warmers runs counter to the spirit of this sort of language, and as i said above, runs directly counter to the concept of them being fully equal to other representatives when serving during a council meeting."
"the council felt otherwise and voted as such.:edit: this was before of course our right to do so was unilaterally revoked as a matter of convenience."
"yeah i know - but you seemed pretty concerned with the csm documentation and what it said regarding the powers of the chair, so i would think the same thing would apply here.side note, if the csm documentation doesn't give the csm the power to change these rules on the fly, doesn't that conflict with your prior opinion?"
"yep, the council was wrong on this instance and we can't be voting constitution changes that contradict the founding documentation. next time lets all read the documentation a little more closely eh?"
"or we could simply change the rules mid-game to suit our own purposes. whichever interpretation floats your boat."
"yea i was just gonna dig this part out. it clearly shows they are supposed to sub in when an elected member can't be there but are relived when they come back."
"jade, it's been proven time and time again, that you do not have the capabilities to read. this has been shown through your inability to construct a clear, concise and brief argument. i promise you the only one here who needs to read it is yourself. so until you get hooked on phonics stop posting about things you do not understand."
"it doesn't show anything of the sort. they fill in for meetings when a representative cannot be there. they get appointed to rep status and they act in the meeting with the full and equal powers of a representative for that meeting. good heavens, talk about clutching at straws"
"1. they are not being replaced at any time. the csm voted on that and reached a contradictory outcome despite how jade and yourself want to continually editorialize the decision2. if they cannot be removed then when does the first elected representative get to vote? do not they also have equal rights. if the first elected representative never gets to come back because the alternate cannot be removed then the elected representative has become lesser than the alternate.this isn't difficult. the issue of \"when\" isn't an issue of equality."
"there you go, thanks for clearing that up for us. as soon as the representatives can be there the alternate is displaced. since the alternates only serve when the first representatives cannot be there and since by definition if they are there they cannot be of the status \"cannot be there\", this means that as soon as the first elected rep returns the alternate is displaced.i am kinda wondering why you voted against delaying that return until after the next agenda item though, it seems kinda harsh towards the alternate."
"i'm just going to chime in here and note that constitutions of any governing body are always up to interpretation.this is why most countries have levels of courts and the likes, in the us is is the supreme court which as a body decides on (votes on) what the interpretation of a given point of the constitution is.jade - you hold no more power over the outcome of voting then any other member in there and have no right to veto/void/nullify a vote, even if it were a vote on the specifics of the constitution. the majority vote should apply even if you feel it violates the constitution and you should be careful to not try to interfere with that process based on your personal interpretation of the constitution. you should also not assume everyone serving with you are a bunch of mindless illiterate idiots, or rather, if you do feel that keep it to yourself and keep the inflammatory remarks about your colleagues reading abilities to yourself. if you feel a topic violates the constitution, then vote against it, that is all the power you have - one vote.you do not hold sole domain over the interpretation of the constitution and you may be better off remembering that."
"i find this conclusion that people not elected are equal to people who are elected quite amazing. there is no \"artificial distinction between the top nine and five alternates\" there is an *absolute* distinction between them; only that top nine have been elected, the others have not.let me make a 'real life' comparison, if i may.there are a number of rl elections which take place on the 'party list' system. the gla in london is one, another it the uk european parliament elections (i use uk examples as you are based in the uk; other countries also operate list systems however).if party a wins five seats and party b wins 4 then the top f on a's list and the top 4 on b's list are elected and serve. nobody else is part of that parliament or assembly.some time later, someone dies / resigns / goes off their trolley and cannot serve anymore. at that time the next person on the list of that party takes over from the member leaving. from that point they are the new 'elected member'. before that they had nothing, and now they do.this is the same distinction as between the top nine and the next five; those five are *not elected* they just happen to be the people ready to step in if required. indeed, should some dread illness strike pilots down and six of the nine disappear into the night then the next person after those five would get their call-up papers. the csm results were a *list* system, and the top nine of those available / able / willing to serve the electorate are those who are the elected members.and nobody else.iz"
"i'll check back when i wake up (about to fall into bed as 2:15am here - ah, the life of a csm member!) but whilst i recall a pointer about this thread i don't recall it being specific to ask us to comment. i'll check properly later.as regards my own ui issues, in writing them up for ccp consideration i had already split them up individually. so far as i can see, in my own cases all the comments were (s) positive, and (b) covered all the contained issues, so i see no reason to suggest that they need additional time in what is solely a different presentational format. what other csm members feel i can't say, but i would suggest that where a discussion thread has covered the proposals then it has covered the proposals no matter what the exact presentation. ymmv though, clearly ...iz"
"jade:you are an advisory board specifically given no power because none is needed as such. you will not change anything. your job is that of a focus group for ccp, an informal and neutered watchdog, and a gameplay thinktank.it was not in ccp's best interest or original intent to give you any kind of actual power whatsoever, and certainly you should not have the right to mute, void, or negate any opinions of the other elected representatives. your position exists because somebody needs to call the meeting to orders and keep things on topic if someone starts talking about the latest sports scores or some such. you achieved chairman be receiving the most votes from a tiny fraction of the gaming public who all thought that you were going to be equals. everyone in the csm seems to understand their marginal usefulness in this role except you."
"they need to have time for discussion because they may or may not be valuable. and they may or may not be as optimal as possible. part of the discussion is refining ideas and changes so that they are as good as possible in a reasonable time frame. giving the players the time to discuss allows the players to contribute to issues that they know will be addressed in some way. frankly its rather important"
"ianna i think the csm documentation contradicts you pretty directly as described above, where it says that alternates serving on the council in place of reps are fully equal to reps themselves.to say an alternate serving on the council in place of a rep can be displaced at a non-serving rep's leisure is to treat them unequally, since the non-serving rep cannot displace another rep instead. the rl example being the usa's brown vs. the board of education which said that \"separate but equal is not equal\". if a serving alternate is subject to some effect that a serving rep is not, then they are not being treated equally."
"you didn't really just compare the csm to brown v. board did you? yeah you did. christ."
"are you going to read the direct counter argument to that or are you going to do like your dear leader and cover your hands over your ears and scream \"la la la la i can't hear you\"but lets deconstruct this one and go over all the ways its wrongs.1. this is not the u.s. judicial system. brown v. board has no precedent.2. even if it did it would not apply because the language of the statement is very clear on when they are equal and when they are not. they are equal when they are serving. they are not when they are not. the document does not state when they are serving except to state that they are serving when the first elected rep is not present. and that issue is not in question, except how to best facilitate a representative returning to the debate. if anything the specific wordage of the section is more strict towards the alternates for when they are removed3. the document does not contradict what inanna says. as she says nothing towards how alternates are treated when they are being an alternate only how they are treated when they are in transition."
"precedent"
"arrrg, too quick trusting the firefox spell checker. woe is me."
"ok. jailhouse lawyer time. is there a document that lays out standing orders for all this?"
"i am having a hard time believing that someone seriously compared issues in the csm to brown vs. board of education.the only reason an alternative is allowed to vote is because someone had stuff that was more pressing then internet spaceship politics. when that person come in to an already started meeting it is only reasonable they assume the position they would have held normally. at this time jade has complete control of what topics are talked during the meetings. he also has control of when the meetings take place. jade can stack votes by scheduling meetings to exclude members of the csm. an example of this is happening thursday. us based reps who work a normal 8 to 5 schedule will not be able to attend the meeting. this specially targets bane and darius. and to top it off he has the ability to mute people *he* views are being disruptive.members of the csm have expressed the intent to put forward a vote to elect a new chair. in response jade has clearly stated he has no intent of letting democracy runs it's course. he stated he will not allow any vote that reduces his power or threatens his ability to decide what the provided documentation means. jade has even gone a step further. he essentially vetoed a passed resolution, because he decided it not inline with the documentation provided by ccp. at the very least he could have raised his concerns to the other reps and held another vote. not jade, he just decides it is not valid. i am saddened by these events. the entity i am most upset with is not jade, which is just being himself. ccp contrived this entire mess and has remained silent the entire time. it is about time ccp starts clarifying the documentation it wrote and not leave it up to the csm."
"you don't get to declare anything void, sunshine. the whole reason you are having these excrutiatingly boring votes is because the meaning of a lot of the csm documents are unclear. the votes were meant to clarify existing issues, such as \"how do alternates work?\", \"what power is available to the chairman to direct conversation\", etc. given the lack of direction from ccp, you have a responsibility to ensure that all members agree on how it should work, and then act in the agreed-upon manner until ccp explicitly states otherwise.you were quite happy to go along with this process until a decision was made that you didn't agree with. as soon as this happened, you began acting like a spoiled child, showing zero respect for the wishes of your council members. you tried to change the wording of the resolution after it had been adopted, because you didn't agree with it. you tried to bully people into changing their vote. you muted people that called you out on your unjustifiable actions. and now, after presumably losing the confidence of your peers in your ability to run the chair, you've decided that you have the power to void the entire process, in effect making the hours and hours of tedious debate you've presided over even more worthless?it bears repeating: who the hell do you think you are? you casually write off what the csm has done thus far because you've changed your mind, and consider yourself within your rights to do so? how do you propose to deal with the vagueness of procedures governing (for example) alternates, now that you've grandly declared that agreed-upon measures don't apply?"
"actually, that's one power he really ought to be exerting more often. the rules of order exist, the chair interprets them, and the council can overrule with 2/3. that's how it works in robert's rules, and it's fairly common in other rules of order too. would have neatly cleaned up the issue of abstaining, too - interpret, maybe get a challenge, but it's disposed of."
"i am sorry, but we are not using robert's rules and there is nothing to interpret. there is no \"sworn in\" nor was he \"accepted for the duration of the meeting\". all of these are made up fantasies of jade constantine. except for the robert's rules part. those are fantasies of everyone else who has to deal with jade constantine subverting the process when things don't go his way."
"even if we take the fanciful assumption that scotus decisions are binding upon an icelandic private corporation's advisory body, the comparison still doesn't follow. this isn't \"separate but equal\", it's \"alternate but not delegate\". you're not supposed to be equal - the delegates won, the alternates got the consolation prize. when they're both members they're treated equally, because members are treated equally, but there's no equality rights when it comes to exercising somebody else's vote when that person gets back to the table."
"it is a procedural issue, however. it should be addressed better before it leads to a problem, such as a delegate returning mid-vote and demanding their vote be counted even though the alternate has already voted, or some such.anyway, not holding out much hope. most of the folks on the council seem to have their head up their ass, or an agenda."
"no, we're not using any rules of order, and that's the problem. but that said, i've never seen a set of rules of order anywhere - legislatures, committees, courtrooms, whatever - that do not give the presiding officer the power to be the first interpreter of the rules of order that the meeting is operating under. the two powers fundamental to the chair are the power to moderate discussions(including ejection in extreme cases) and the power to interpret the rules of order - it's what being the chair means. any conceivable rules of order give those two powers to the chair, because without those powers being somewhere the meeting will almost inevitably descend into anarchy at some point(cf. half of the last meeting), and there is no logical place to vest those powers except the presiding officer of the meeting - i.e., the chair. trying to operate without those powers in place is insanity - it'd be like deleting the crown from the westminster system, the whole thing just falls apart in extremis. and given how this csm seems to be functioning, \"in extremis\" is a thrice weekly affair.actually, that one was dealt with correctly at the beginning of the last meeting. full points to the csm there for a rational compromise."
"quoting myself from page 4. nice to see so many of you agree with me."
"well that is great. and when the council agrees on rules of order and when the rules of order give first interpretation to the chair then the chair will be right within their power to do so.however, rules of order come about by votes in the political process. no body starts out and before it gets going has everything in place. no, they vote it out and get their rules of order in order by consensus or majority. robert's rules did not spring miraculously out of thin air, and nor have any rules for any governing body.jade doesn't want to play by the rules. he usurps power he does not have, he invents rules and order that do not exist, he interprets original documents which is outside his scope, and attempts to modify the result of votes already recorded.its perfectly reasonable, especially for a small body such as this one to operate by majority or consensus and adopt rules in such a manner. there was a problem \"how do we deal with x\" they voted on it, it was accepted. except that since it didn't go the way jade voted he mis-characterizes the vote. and then when another vote does not go the way he wants, he badgers equal representatives into changing their votes. it simply does not work that way. and if there is any passage of the original document that directly shows that it is the one where it says \"all voting members are equal\". equal does not include more rights than others. ever. and that means that there can be no right of the chairman to interpret anything first. and there can be no right of the chairman to veto and there can be no right of the chairman to prevent others from discussing or voting.sorry, if anything the powers described and actions taken are expressly forbidden."
"wait, goum is still hounding the csm after losing miserably (both in votes and behaviour)?"
"no, where have you been?"
"there we go fixed that for you."
"hey herschel - i'm not saying anyone is bound by a decision made in any other system. i'm just drawing on the logic used there because it applies here given what is in the csm document - if you like, forget i brought up that example, the argument is the same without it.you say \"you're not supposed to be equal\" but the csm document directly contradicts you and that's what needs to be recognized.having some special status while serving at a council meeting whereby you can be bumped as soon as some person not at that meeting decides its time, is not being equal to other people who do not have that special status. that's my point.and maybe it's an arcane point and it probably doesn't matter - but ianna clearly doesn't get it, and i think most of the rest of the council hasn't considered it much. but the equality argument based on the csm document is pretty solid."
"they are only equal in the context of when they are substituted for an absent member. i don't understand how you guys struggle with this concept so much. alternates are clearly not equal to standing csm delegates by virtue of the fact that they don't get to vote unless they are substituting. the key point is when they attain equality and when they lose it."
"bah stupid alt."
"halca, i think the bit \"while serving on the council\" indicates clearly that they gain that equality when they are asked to step in and they do not lose it until the meeting is over. at the next meeting the chair calls in the representatives (and any alternates needed, in order per the csm document) and the process begins anew.\"when\" is pretty clear - and it's strange to think that the when is arbitrarily based on when a rep chooses to re-enter the chamber, because that gives the absent rep power over an alternate that they do not have over one of the first 9 reps, which is unequal."
"they are substitutes for someone absent. if the absentee returns they are no longer needed. they are not equal when the person they replaced returns. this is logic. insisting that this is some sort of subversion is sensationalist for the sake of it. we are not talking about life changing decisions here, we're talking about spaceships.the equality statement is there to allow alternates to vote with equal voice while they are substituting. it does not state anywhere that they should remain in the meeting for any length of time. it makes sense to allow them to stay for the conclusion of an issue they have become involved with in the process of substituting for an absentee but once that person returns, it is simply an arbitrary decision to say whether they should stay for the remainder of the meeting or leave once the issue has been concluded and in this sense they are not equal and implying that's what the document states is clearly disengenuous.now you have got me talking on csm points which i argued against the csm itself doing yesterday. if there is a problem understanding something (and there clearly is) then ccp should be approached. if ccp want the csm or the chair to arbitrate and construct rules then they should unequivocably state this. all arguments about the finer points before this occcurs are pointless and irrelevant."
"(heh, sorry for getting you into a debate, i just find this stuff interesting, and it is funny that we're having a \"constitutional argument\" over internet spaceship politics)it's not disingenuous, that's actually what the document says - and all it says - about alternates. you're adding an additional interpretation when you say that the equal clause \"only applies until the rep gets back\". if you read over the csm documents there's nothing at all about reps stepping out of the chamber for a while and having an alternate take their place until they come back. all it says about alternates is that if a rep cannot attend a meeting, the alternate replaces them and when serving in that capacity they are equal to all other reps.i maintain the argument that if you can be bumped out of the meeting at any time, you are not equal to other reps who cannot be bumped out."
"if they were equal then all alternates would vote all the time. they do not. they are only equal for the purposes of replacing an official rep and when the rep cannot be at the meeting. you have stated this yourself. if a rep returns the replacement is no longer needed. this seems pretty simple to me.you are talking about one case where someone can't attend a meeting and extending it into the situation where someone is late to a meeting or someone needs to step away for a time. you've also stated yourself that the document does not state any rules in this regard so why are you also extending an argument to say it does? in my estimation common sense would dictate that while a rep cannot be present a substitute should be called for and when they are present the substitute should step down. i don't think that is too much of an extension and does not in any way impinge on the rights of an alternate in voting when they are there.rules and exceptions should be made to err on the side of the reps, not the alternates because they are alternates."
"if the equal standing does not end when the first elected rep gets back, when does equal standing end?since the document defines no end point except by defining the terms of which alternates serve \"when the representative cannot attend\". if you are saying that when the representative returns the alternate is still entitled to vote, then either the alternate can never be displaced and the council is now 10 members. or the representative can never return.both of these interpretations are ridiculous. and they are the only options that must necessarily flow from your interpretation of the language. but you support neither of these. you support something entirely different. you support the representative coming back at the end of the meeting. regardless of the duration that \"he was unable to attend\". this is a direct contradiction of any reading of the language.furthermore, there is no \"additional interpretation\" about it \"only applies until the rep gets back\". the equality clause states that the alternate has equality when acting as an alternate. such, the equality clause only applies during the time that the alternate can be acting for the first elected representative.such you then find in the document where it says when alternates take that position. only during the time in which the document says alternates take that position does the equality apply.here is a good example. suppose you and your mother were having an argument. you wanted to play video games and stay up late, and your father wanted you to go to bed at 9 pm sharp. so your mother says \"you can stay up and play video games as long as you want when your father is not home\". because she doesn't care so long as your father doesn't find out.now, if you went to her later and said \"father left for an hour then returned, so i stayed up and played video games for four hours because that was as long as i wanted to\" she would say \"you're grounded, the section regarding as long as you wanted only applied when your father was not here, once your father returned, that part no longer applied and you could no longer play video games as long as you wanted but had to go to bed\".you are the one saying that the result applies regardless of the condition, when instead the result only occurs when the condition is met.when do they have equality? when serving in a voting capacity for a representative. when do they serve in a voting capacity for a representative? when the representative is unable to attend. if the representative is present is the representative unable to attend? no, if the representative is present the representative is able to attend, since if the representative were unable he could not be present. if the representative is able to attend does the alternate serve in a voting capacity? no. if the alternate is not serving in a voting capacity do they have equality? no.the resolution reached by the council is actually more lenient than a strict reading of the language. it gives more rights to the alternates by ensuring that agenda items are completed as a whole. its the equivalent to your mom saying \"its o.k. if you finish that level so you can save\" instead of her walking in and shutting your game system down. its a reasonable compromise that both upholds the integrity of the representative while not wasting an alternates time by making him take part in a discussion where he will not vote, or the councils time by having to repeat information or wait for the representative to catch up and state their case."
"good lord look at all these interpretations. let's be clear on something. the statement in the document regarding equal standing is in effect only when people are serving as representatives. the equal standing clause only applies to representatives.there is obvious ambiguity when it comes to whether or not an alternate can be called in during a meeting and then unseated when the elected official returns. we sought to clarify this with a vote. the results were not liked and were unilaterally overturned. hopefully ccp will provide further clarification since voting on the issue democratically has been deemed by one to be insufficient. i have to wonder what the whole point is at that point but it is what it is. some of us think it's a council and others a dictatorship.i believed that line to be a boilerplate and common statement in documents of this type which in essence merely states that for purposes of voting all votes are equal. jade got 43 or so votes more than hardin but in terms of voting jade's votes do not count for any more. i believe that to be pretty much the sole purpose of this paragraph of the document. that all reps are equal.ccp openly stated that they wanted us to \"fill in the blanks\". we attempted to do so. someone didn't like the results. now we have to wait for ccp to say again \"fill in the blanks\" because obviously the first time wasn't good enough. really as far as i'm concerned it's all just a waste of time as there was never any need for this stupid circlejerk of a \"leadership\" structure in the first place. someone has interpreted a \"chair\" as being some form of absolute leader over a council of adults and we've wasted ****loads of time debating that, when in reality everyone should just shut up and talk about spaceships. sure someone needs to schedule meetings and organize the agenda, but 9 adults do not need to be lorded over, muted or told how to vote.this only works if the person asserting they have some form of \"power\" doesn't use it or abuse it. i don't think i'm wrong in stating that there at least 8 people on the council that would love to be discussing eve. discussing and voting on issues related to a videogame as adults. not as insignificant children who need to be herded or lead by some self-appointed demigod.all of this debate is an unfortunate distraction from the issues at hand and has really shown the worst sides of some people, but i also don't think many are surprised whatsoever. personally i'm going to remember that a snake is a snake. if someone brings it into your house it's going to bite you. you can't hate the snake for being a snake. i believe ccp's hope was that these things could be worked out reasonably internally but i believe you can all see from the results of last weekend's vote and subsequent \"overturning\" of that vote that this is simply not going to happen. i personally hold ccp far more accountable for the current status than i do jade.i don't like snakes but common sense dictates that i blame their appearance in the chicken coop on the people who put them there. this is just plain stupid and unfortunately a democratic solution will not be allowed to prevail. at least if nothing else we're proving to ccp why their proposed \"structure\" is silly at best."
"hahaha, a goon being the voice of reason. the csm really is that terrible."
"i hate to admit this, but i have to agree with goumindong... it seems quite straight forward to me...at some point in a meeting, if one of the 9 csm representatives is not able to be there for what ever reason, then an alternate steps in. at this point the alternate is an equal member for voting purposes, their vote counts just like the rest of the 9... if the missing representative arrives, returns or otherwise shows up, the alternate would be required to step aside (if mid-vote, the elected representative may wish to allow the alternate to complete the vote if they feel their vote, after missing the prior discussion, would be uninformed, but this would be up to the representative, not the chair or the alternate).regardless of the make up of the csm, rules like this all need to be defined in a way that limits the ability to interpret them, in this case i think they were (the not available clause). if you wanted to clarify this better, there is no reason why all 14 representatives (9 csm members and 5 alts) should not make an effort to be in and be included in all online meetings, this way the alternates are informed if asked to step in for a time. the alternates could add to the discussion (within reason) but would only be able to vote if they were acting in the stead of one of the 9."
"a meeting is not considered valid unless seven council membersin any combination of alternatives and representativesare present. the published meeting notes will display the members in attendance, and the main transcript vault will keep a running tally of the meeting attendance of all representatives. where applicable, representatives are encouraged to post chat logs as a supplement to the meeting notes as well. the recommended guideline for meetings is at least once per week,with a minimum of nine representatives present.this is from the csm documents. the interesting part is highlighted by italics...maybe alternates, once given voting status, keep it for the rest of the meeting, regardless of how many representatives come after they do?take care,bruce hansen"
"another way to look at that is that a meeting needs a combination of nine (reps and alternates to begin) but it remains quorate as long as there is a combination of seven reps and alternates present. of course this is me guessing and its very ambiguous - lets add it to list of things we need clarified by ccp i guess."
"inanna,you need to split the issues apart for presentation to the players and for discussion and voting by representatives. the issues, if successful through the csm vote, then are presented to ccp.currently, by lumping issues in together, players can not coherently discuss and debate each issue seperately, and arguments and discussions are hard to follow through a thread. it will be even harder when a particular issue is a source of contention or needs changing due to overlooked ramifications.additionally, when presented in a csm meeting, having multiple issues makes discussion about each one much harder, if not impossible (eg, 60+ issues on science and industry). each issue must be able to be discussed and debated in a csm meeting by the representatives. a clear yay or nay vote on each issue must also be made by the csm. by having multiple issues together, this is impossible. poor issues get through the entire process, and csm representatives get no opportunity to vote them down, without rejecting many good issues. the same is also true when a few good issues are amoungst many bad ones.your issues may all be good and serve the greater needs of the eve players. however, it is important all issues are presented the same way and equal opportunity given to each issue for every player and representative to discuss/debate and the representatives to vote on. take care,bruce hansen"
"the point i think all of us in the council were in agreement on is that the document in this regard is ambiguous as i said. it doesn't say when voting status is given or whether an alternate serves for the entire meeting or only until the representative occurs. it gives precisely zero guidance in this regard. that's why we held the vote. we don't vote just to vote. there was a gap we tried to fill.we can posit 101 maybes as regards this but at the end of the day the fact is that the document does not give guidance in that regard and the chair decided the vote didn't count. what this means is on ccp's lap as the chair has the potential to simply mute anyone who doesn't abide by their interpretation of the rules and has removed any ability for the council to remedy or reconcile this.it's effectively the chair's show at this point until ccp does or doesn't say otherwise. i don't believe the document says that the chair should wield supreme power or even any really either but the ability to kick and mute without any recourse pretty much seals the deal as the chair's show. there is no remedy except via ccp. they made that possible."
"i can't believe i'm doing this, but i'm quoting goumindong for truth. he's exactly right."
"well when the meeting ends the alternate ceases to serve in the meeting and the equality issue goes away. when the next meeting is set up the first 9 reps are again requested to attend and if one or more can't alternates can be called in their place. you'll note that the csm document doesn't say alternates \"jump in\" when a rep has to step out, it says they are asked to attend the meeting when a rep cannot make the meeting. so the whole subbing in, subbing out thing is not covered in the csm document, except where it cautions against using alternates lightly. technically i think according to the csm document you could start a meeting with 8 reps (the minimum for a valid meeting is 7) if someone is going to be five minutes late. likewise if someone has to step out as long as the total doesn't go below 7 there's no conflict with the documentation. it's only situations where a rep says they can't make it, or can only be there for a small portion of the meeting, that the documentation suggests an alternate should be called in to serve for the meeting.that said, it's academic as darius noted. it's only of interest because obviously nobody considered what the csm document said before the vote, and there are still some reps, including ianna, holding an interpretation that runs counter to what little can be found there."
"bruce,the issues we've been putting together to discuss are being put together as the players presented them. i think we can all agree that the issues forum is less than optimal in many many ways. given that all we can do as a council is attempt to take the issues as provided and stated and attempt to re-frame them for discussion. if you don't like the way an issue is framed in the issue forum, frame it yourself another way. the council does not create issues. we pass them on.i understand your calls for clarity and agree with you. perhaps your call should be raised as an issue on the issues forum so we can discuss it. we'd actually discussed the idea of even having all of these issues submitted by players in a template. the bottom line however is that it's our obligation to address these issues as they're presented. if they're given to us poorly in a lump by players then that's what we have to work with.the end result will hopefully be much clearer when it's presented but it's not to us to take one issue and make it 20. it's not to us to do that in order for players to debate. the forum for debate is there though crappy and we have no control or input into the environment that takes place in aside from telling ccp we think it sucks."
"i will ask you not to put words or thoughts into the heads of people who voted. the document in no way runs counter to the results of the vote as i've stated. to say that \"the people who voted clearly didn't take into account the document\" is assinine and unfounded. the document is subject to interpretation. the interpretation that the majority of the council holds is different from yours. there is no one right answer to this question, but only one way to follow it. thus the council voting.:edit: to clarify the document says nothing about lengths of terms. you're deciding it does. it doesn't. that was what the vote was. can alternates serve temporarily or do the rightfully elected representatives resume their seats upon return? that is in no way mentioned in that document as much as anyone may try to wordsmith it to make it say so."
"i'm not talking about the results of the vote - i think there's a fair argument to make that you work with what you got. i'm referring to ianna's statement that representatives and alternates are not equal, when the documentation contradicts that and says that when serving in a meeting, they are. that's all."
"inanna is right as well. representatives are equal. alternates are not representatives. only when they are appointed and become representatives due to the lack of an elected one being there do they become equal. this paragraph states nothing more in my opinion than that all votes are equal and it's been overblown to hilarious proportions by sideline wannabe e-lawyers."
"darius, there are clear and easy steps that you can take to remedy the situation. you can vote down multiple issues presented and send them back to the players with the explanation \"we cannot vote on multiple issues\". you can provide an area to discuss each issue in this very own forum where no one would be hindered by the support mechanism and could present logical arguments under threat of moderation by ccp.the problem comes in that the csm is fundamentally shirking its duty to have the public discussions required one each issue before voting. it is the result of these discussions that are to be taken to ccp based on the judgement of the csm. it is not the csms duty to be a messanger to ccp. they can read the forums as well as anyone else. its your duty to examine and judge what is important, to explain why, and explain reservations against possible fixes. i.e. to convey legitimate \"do wants\" and \"do not wants\". its not happening. but beyond that, its out of order according to the csm document when said lump issues are presented since each issue needs to have its own separate discussion and vote. just as it is beyond jades power to veto bills its beyond the csms power to vote on the block issues and present them to ccp."
"i am going to bold this so it gets though.unless the csm document specifically says that the alternate serves an entire meeting regardless of the attendance of the first elected representative then there is no reading of the language which can make that a reasonable interpretation, unless the csm agree that that is the point at which they will return. you are outright fabricating rules out of whole cloth."
"goum...firstly there's a huge pink elephant in the room that everyone's ignoring in this regard and that's the fact that we were given a very limited timeline to get issues on the table to even bring to iceland. that doesn't leave a lot of room to get the process perfect as we're having to spend all our time scrambling just to have issues to bring. the reason there's no time being given to debate is that ccp did not give us the time to debate. as many things as i have problems with this is a huge one and it's simply not the council's fault. again, pretty cute idea but i feel the ball was completely dropped in the execution.tl;dr the debate isn't happening because we haven't had sufficient time. blame ccp. regarding the csm document... discussing that at all is a moot point because no votes will be allowed to be had on that. raise it as an issue in the other forum and we'll see if bringing it to iceland doesn't get unilaterally vetoed. (hint: it's too late to do this as an issue has to exist for 7 days before brining it to council and ccp needs all issues 7 days before the meeting)"
"i can accept a standard of interpretation like that no problem, but the same kind of standard applies to ruckuses about the definition of what powers are involved in moderating a meeting, what constitutes \"discussion\", etc."
"i agree. the difference of opinion lies in the difference between democracy and dictatorship. in one case the group decides it's a problem and steps up. in the other one person gets to decide what conversation is allowed by their own judgement. i do not think this was ever remotely the intent of the csm whatsoever."
"you're incorrect on all counts, despite the bolding. we can only agree to disagree goum, as usual."
"and i am sure you are going to quote me the section that says \"alternates serve an entire meeting regardless of the attendance of the first elected representative\"?i am going to be very clear on this a second time. if such a passage exists, i am wrong and will retract all statements. if such a statement does not exist, then i am right and you are wrong.so you say i am incorrect on all counts. prove me wrong. that is all you have to do, page number and paragraph(preferably with the small or large document so i don't have to go fishing through two). it will be quite easy since, as you say, i am so clearly wrong. right?"
"then you bring less. you've had 2 official meetings 7 days apart. you were not required to have game issues at both. it sucks, but its what you had to work with.its better to do it right and bring less issues, but more important ones with better input than it is to do it wrong and bring more issues with no direction and input.its too late now, but it wasn't when this was brought up(1 day after the first official meetings agenda was published, which was the second meeting by jade constantine's reckoning)"
"this is what you were incorrect about:1) there is no reading of the language which can make that a reasonable interpretation2) you are outright fabricating rules out of whole cloth.neither is correct. what i outlined is a reasonable reading (there are others), and it was based only on the csm document and so not fabricated out of nothing.time to let it ride cause we're not going to agree.also, i agree with darius regarding getting stuff done > rules lawyering, it's just fun to play constitutional law with internet spaceship councils."
"not much i can do about it now. there's a lot about this process we clearly didn't anticipate. i personally could not conceive that ccp would allow this to be run this way. next time around we'll put a goon in the chair instead of assuming it's a democracy and we'll deal with it from there.for now i work with what i have to work with."
"where did you outline it? i have explained three times how your \"outline\" based on equality is false. all you have said is \"nuh uh\".you and jade constantine do not get to declare things the truth. you must present your argument or show the truth.show it or make your argument. where is the statement in the document that defines what you are describing?"
"so you guys pushed two representatives in order to have more votes, expecting a democracy. and for the next csm term you're realizing that the way to power/control is to grab the chair position, rather than more council votes.sounds like thinking has changed from \"let's control the issues\" to \"let's control the whole csm process\", due to what's happening now. yes, it's completely politics, on all sides involved, and has always been. don't know if ccp expected anybody to do all the work of separating the signal from the noise for them for free and with their (or the game's) best interests at heart, but they were stupid if they did.this is eve's community, after all.actually, let me edit that:if the csm is a political body whose purpose is to alter game mechanics in the interest of various groups within the community, then everyone is on the right track here, and in fact you should form parties and have campaigns and all that stuff.if the csm, on the other hand, is supposed to just be a bunch of secretaries responsible for pointing ccp towards the various [issues], then why the hell did anyone sign up? one lousy trip to iceland doesn't seem to be worth the effort/work."
"darius,actually, the multiples were presented by representatives, for example: science and industry (lavista pdf document, 60+ issues).issues should be presented seperately- representatives should not support multiple issues (presented together as one topic/issue) in the issue forum or propose multiple issues. bruce"
"bruce,my apologies then i can't speak to what other people do. i've personally only adopted issues which were raised by others, with the exception of one which is pretty cut and dried. sorry for the misunderstanding. i'll let lavista handle his own laundry."
"the csm wasn't defined well at all by anyone. you're right. as it stands today it's not worth the effort in my opinion and had it been done before and turned out this way i'm sure many people wouldn't have run. if it gets fixed then awesome. we'll just have to wait and see."
"you may re-read all my posts above at your leisure."
"why? there's nothing of actual substance in them."
"treat me like an idiot who is unable to scroll up. lay out the argument step by step. feel free to include a rebuttal to the csm document which clarifies when the alternate is equal and when they are not."
"it's called the lalalalalalalalala i can't hear you defense."
"how on earth does this make sense. it's like asking a president about to get impeached if impeaching should be allowed. this should be delegated to someone that isn't gs/you/people you muted"
"how about the fact i want to measure to get through? i want it written into the constitution and i want to make sure all future csm chairs are elected by the committee. kinda gives me a decent motive to make it happen doncha think?"
"someone seems to have conveniently overlooked this comment."
"that's not the point being made."
"sorry darius, couldn't find a way to do it this time. still, we do have two meetings this week, i'm just posting up the details of the sunday one where you can bring up your votes and motions and whatnot. as we all agreed last week this mid-week one is for confirming the issues are properly documented and sent to ank. make sure you get yours done and emailed by the deadline on thursday and all well."
"so why not have them saturday/sunday? how does it make any sense to not allow the elected members to participate?"
"i never agreed to this meeting. it was scheduled so that american attendees could not make it. this is actually your second attempt at this. should i re-forward you the note from ccp regarding meeting scheduling from the last time?"
"we're having one on sunday. this thursday one is a sign-off meeting to ensure we've got relevant documentation agreed for all the issues submission templates we're taking to iceland (agreed from the previous weeks). they need to be bundled up and sent to ccp by ank by thursday evening at the latest. the meeting in this case is a formality to let us sort out the last issues and double check everyone has done their stuff. if we had to wait till sunday we'd be flying to iceland with no issues to discuss. while i can understand that might make darius' workload a little easier its probably not the best use of our time or ccp's isk."
"i guess if all your trying to do is steal votes sure."
"in that case why aren't all the issues posted in the proclamations forum for everyone to see?as long as they are all there with the relevant csm reps commenting, i see no point to this meeting.oh, and as an alternate i again will be unavailable due to timezone issues."
"removed stupidity."
"it's not a question of making a workload esier, it's that you continually schedule meetings that conflict with at least two delegates, and one alternate. there could be more than this, but as far as i know you are forcing 2 elected delegates to skip out of their paying job, or visiting time with their family so you can get an extra hour of sleep. the meeting doesn't have to wait until sunday, and when you are unyielding to the other delegates needs it shows how well you are at doing your primary job of csm, that of scheduling meetings. if you can't get that right, then how can you do the secondary job, that you gave yourself, of moderation?"
"chair, could i please ask what \"a way to do it this time\" means? despite over 50 emails flinging their way around the internet today on the csm group email there was nothing that i saw asking council members about their time availability. similarly i made a comment above about using the third forum channel here for what is its apparent purpose, and making it clear to everyone which matters they will be receiving guaranteed responses from ccp about as we put them forward. the matters for this coming meeting are not ones which actually need everyone online at the same moment.aside, given that you have scheduled this when at least two elected members cannot make it (and can clearly be deemed already to have sent their apologies, which i am sure they will also put on record before the meeting if you still go ahead on this schedule) then have you asked the top two pilots on the alternates list (ie #10 and #11) to stand by, and have they indicated that they are able to make this timeslot?iz"
"this thursday meeting is there purely to check we have the adequate documentation for the issues we have already voted for. and to vote on the individual elements of multipart issues we've included on principle but haven't yet individually decided on.its not going to be a formal meeting in the form of agenda and administrative stuff, its mostly a document-checking collaborative session. members that can't make this meeting are welcome to send in the votes on individual parts of lavista's, yours, and ank's multi-part issues and we'll record them for the record. as for the timing it can't be helped really, we had to do this by thursday as you know. it can't wait till the weekend and on a weeknight we have an issue with whats doable for the us people is too late for some euro people. i took a decision based on what we have to achieve at that meeting. if it turns out to be me, ank and you and six sets of mailed in multi-part votes then we won't be officially quorate but we can still help ank on the secretarial duties of assembling the documents for ccp. all these things have already been voted \"yes\" on principle and we are within our rights to send them on.re the proposal to use the proclamations forum for this - we haven't yet been told what that forum is for, it won't be read only and in the current climate of extreme forum trolling/spam campaigns from a certain group i don't believe it will be a conducive environment for this. also its a waste of effort on our part, we're assembly word docs that will be available for all csm reps to examine via the eve-csm list at the moment. i see no reason to increase the administrative burden on everyone further by reproducing this stuff on another forum section.we'll get the job done."
"to be frank, provided it's not an actual voting meeting but rather an informal get-together where our opinions and such can be mailed in it's not really a big deal in my opinion."
"that was always the point darius, its what i said when we brought it up last week. the formal meeting this week is sunday 15th 18:00 hours. this one was always a document checking thing first and foremost. the mailed in votes we will need are on these 3 issues : ui (separate issues discussed in the op)"
"so are you going to *document check/editorialize* like you did with hardins idea?"
"you're an awesome chairman. really, you are."
"something i've just noticed whilst re-reading some stuff in preparation to complete my submission documents ...ignoring a moment that you've repeated yourself, the time is actually unclear and depends on your country of origin.in some countries the use of a 24-hour clock is normal at \"01:00\" would be read as 1am not pm, but given the \"thursday afternoon\" you quoted twice i believe that 1pm (aka 13:00) was intended and will act accordingly. (i also don't believe it likely that ankh is intending to be awake at 1am to edit them all!)izps tq came back early and *stable* yay!ps2. jade: you didn't answer about the two alternates"
"a simple solution to this matter given that you guys are all in different timezones would be for you to make any future deadlines in 24 hour format using standard in-game time as the guide."
"ok i guess i post this question here for the csm reps. since i can not find a decent thread to post in that is not either a)buried on the 13 page or b) is not strewn with eye poking. i would like to understand how an issue is brought up to the csm from the assembly forum that has an overwhelming non support from the player base, that clearly does not have the support?it does not seem right. how can ccp sit there and with a straight face and look at the \"suggestion\" brought up by the csm when the player base says they do not want it?aren't you a little bit concerned that by pushing agendas that has no or very little support from the player base makes the csm look foolish in the eyes of ccp? so when you do ask to push a \"hot button\" item that has the support from the player base, ccp is not going to look at you and not take you seriously?"
"thats how we've been doing it so far."
"takes personal judgement really. if an issue has 30 decent supports and 200 iterations of the same argument against by the same corp/pressure group then the issue can still be raised by the decision of a csm rep. we all have to learn to spam filter the issue threads and ignore the background noise. our job is to get what we believe are decent suggestions that will be of value to the player base on the agenda. its not our task to be popular by agreeing with the barking of a mob. that said, i think we've presented a very good cross-section of issues for this first session that do represent all the best suggestions made on the assembly hall that could be raised within the time constraints and 7 day advance discussion rule. if you feel we've forgotten something important that will have been up for open discusion for the 7 day mark by sunday's meeting then feel free to ask one of us to take a look."
"no jade, there is nothing in particular that i have in mind. i have no aspirations of any of the topics presented by the csm or the player base. i just \"try\" to look at them with a different eye. (playing eve regularly for little over 5 years now i have learned to accept and adapt what has been handed down to me) i have been reading a lot of issues about \"game mechanics\". \"i am not even going to touch the other crap that has to deal with goons or your self.\" it is when i see a thread that has 20 support votes and 200 posts like you said. that is a red flag for me. when the thread came up about changing ammo, and i saw 84 posts and 82 support, i just peaked at the initial post and knew that was a no brainer.when there is a disparity of the number of votes i have to wonder and i take the time to read some of the posts and gloss over the repeat threadnoghts and look for new posts that would easily be counted to show a majority of non-support."
"as discussed during the last meeting, i will be unable to make the thursday discussion due to previous non-negotiable commitments. please arrange for an alternate to stand in my place./serenity."
"so your saying you would not give it any time at all even though you issue has less support just because you ducks masterbate to the thought of you."
"so anyone who opposes you is automatically a goon and some insulting-sounding variety of animal, and as such their opinion can be discounted without further consideration? there are third-world dictators with less ego and chutzpah than that."

"you continue your love of good grammar and restrained capitalization from the previous thread, i see. cheap shots aside, while your thread may have more votes than the others, it's also had a lot more opposition. my two (fix the forums/option to change all ammo at once) are both wholly uncontroversial, with the majority of the non-vote posts being supporters who forgot to click. while they may have less raw support, they're something everybody agrees on, and as such not only can they be passed through easily(allowing for faster meetings, which means more room for business to be conducted), they can be delivered to ccp easily and hopefully implemented quickly, which gives the ccp concrete achievements to use to defend themselves from accusations of various types. besides, there's been two weeks and 24 issues considered - there'll be time for your complaints to be heard just like everybody else's. if you've really got that big a problem, evemail the most receptive csm members and ask them to put it on the agenda - it'll work a lot better than a whine thread on csm issue selection methodologies."

"addendum to issue discussion points.on rereading the minutes, some issues have already been aparently resolved. feel free to discard points if they have been formally resolved to majority council satisfaction."
"please add to the discussion, what is the formal quorum for a meeting and for a decision ie how many abstains make the issue unresolved, noting the conventional interpretation of an \"abstain\" as meaning \"i neither support or dissent\". the conventional wisdom of the interaction of an abstain with a majority is;- (majority = number of ayes /( membership count - abstains ))> 0.5 where ((membership count - abstains) > quorum). is this the formula being to be used, or will the council invent a new formula?"
"heres a draft of what a standing orders document might look like;-----------------------------------------------------------standing orders for the procession of csm meetings.orders conatained within the ccp scope document.1) that the attendance quorum be 7 members2) that an issue must be available for comment for 7 days prior to the meeting, and be aproved by either 5% of player base, or a member of the csm3) that an issue may remain as long as necesary to obtain either approval or disaproval. an approved issue must be escalated to ccp4) aproval takes the form of a simple majority for an issue to pass, ayes must outnumber naes. an abstain is not counted as a nae*1. (add others as deduced from the document)voted on standing orders:5) an alternative candidate may start participating at the point a candidate becomes absent, and must yield when the candidate returns.*2(add others as needed)ideas for standing orders:6) at any point a csm member can propose a vote on an issue of standing orders. this vote halts the progress of the meeting, which does not proceed till the issue is resolved. the chair is compelled to follow the vote. (this is pretty standard stuff with meetings)7) any move to mute a member must be subject to a simple majority vote, which would include the proposed mutee. the mutee must be permitted to address the motion. (strike suggestion 8, it contradicts simple majority by implying absolute)suggestion on meeting protocol:during a meeting, for someone to take the floor they should say something like \"floor\" or even an \"x\". they go onto a queue and take turns as per the queue.if a person wants to directly address a point, they should say something like \"addressing <person name>\". they are put onto the top of the queue after the current speaker. this must only be used to address a specific persons comments (for instance to correct a mistake), anything else is outside of process. for the purpose of decorum, other members must be addressed via the chair (for instance , instead of \"darius, i think xyz you jerk!\" you might say \"chair, i submit that i disagree with darius and think xyz\") addresses to the chair however might be addressed directly to the council \"council, i submit the chair is incorrect on this matter, for reasons xyz\".a motion on meeting procedure, constitutional matters, or standing issues however interupts the current meeting, and thus takes precedent even over the current floor speaker. (ie \"objection, chair, xyz is speaking outside the scope. i vote we move on\", a vote then ensues). when a speaker has finished , he should indicate with an \"end\" or something like that.*1 note, in formal terms a simple majority is defined as a vote where more ayes are recorded than nayes. an abstain does not count as a nae. where an abstain is called a nae, this is refered to as \"absolute majority\". ccp states clearly, this is not the case. this would appear to resolve the issue of the status of abstain votes.*2 unresolved. the principles of simple majority state that a vote can be reversed in the agregate positive. this would imply a member can revert the vote of an alternative, but its a bit ambiguous. does the csm agree?-----------------------------------------you'd have to fill in the blanks and reorganise it, but i think the above would pretty much satisfy everyone. think about it csm reps. something like the above would be a pretty classy framework thats based on traditional meeting procedure, and address everyones concerns (particularly regarding orderly meeting behavior, and it would permit the chair to exercise his role, whilst allowing the csm members a mechanism to reject a chairs ruling)"

"personally i think having the csm ask ccp to actually do what they should have done from day one and write the csm a proper set of cast iron procedural rules rather than turning over yet another session of the csm to this. a csm that votes itself power only leads to power block voting and disperate factions within the csm fighting each other for control which is something i don't believe ccp wanted particularly."

"dippins, theres some excelent ideas in there. i think we need to keep the proposal simple, and basically dependant on the original documents.what we have o work with is pretty simple1) simple majority voting. a very specific idea. look it up on wikipedia.2) a limited scope.3) a very loose mandate of how the council works. now by my reckoning, that means what is needed is more a concept of how a meeting should run, such that we keep a sense of civility between the diferent personalities, and such that two objectives can be meta) jades responsibility to keep the council orderly andb) the councils right to full unimpeded rights to speechit would seem the reason (a) and (b) conflict is a lack of standing orderergo what we need is a standing orders document thats simple, comprehensible, with minimal scope for conflicting interpretaion but most importantly a canonical document to refer procedural debates to.jades job should be mechanical and predictable. if any member can not work out if an action is permisable, then something is wrong. jade must thus make a call , and nobody is to blame if they disagree. if this occurs, something is wrong with the procedure."
"i agree in principle, but in practicality, the csm has been formed with no real standing orders. its not unusual, as a public servant i see it all the time. but honestly experience says get this **** out of the way first, and it'll never be a problem again. this council experiences pain so the following ones have a clear mandate. what we used to do in my days on the local council was make sure a lawyer had ratified standing orders so we didn't need to (prior to committee forming). but this hasn't happened here, so i guess we gotta do it ourself.please take this seriously guys. it'll save heartache later on."
"wonderfull. having something like this from the beginning would have made this run alot smoother. we didnt have this so its good to make it."

"i don't know, you could probably find the answer with kyle frost - he was in an npc corp for 5 months when he joined eve-o. there are reasons to be in npc corps - you can't be war-dec'd. they provide a good place to learn the ropes. are they taken advantage of? sure. just about any \"game\" written has aspects that can be tweaked or exploited. i may be new to the game, but i imagine if the game has been out for 5 years, ccp is aware of *where* their paying customers are, and why they are there.war-dec system needs to be looked at, both from the \"aggression side\" and from the \"defending\" side. corp-hopping needs to be looked at, and the function of npc corps need to be examined (both for war purposes and training). jumping back and forth repeatedly should not be an option.forcing play styles shouldn't be allowed either tho. eve-o is a business, and as such, csm's or no, ccp probably wants to keep it running and profitable. this means (imho) that ccp will try to keep as *many* people as possible happy, or at least not too discontented. thats going to (in turn) means carebears, pvpr's, empire and o.o are all going to get less than they want.i support the discussion and hope some good ideas get sent up to ccp.respectfully,ak"
"wardecs vs corps/alliances are very much fine now.the only issue i see is alts to raise wardec fees, and inability to wardec specific people in noobcorps for more then 3 months or so.war always (naturally) favours the aggressor to some extent. that's only common-sense - he wouldn't be the aggressor if he did not think he would win, and, naturally, the defender has no control over the duration of the war, unless he takes it to the aggressor and steamrolls him (thereby taking counter-initiative and making the war mutual so the initial aggressor doesn't have any control when the war ends either!), or proves to be too hard of a opponent defensively making the aggressor simply give up.defenders are aided by knowledge of territory and friends/etc (well, in low-sec; in high-sec it's not so applicable), and fighting from your base always has some advantages (i know in this last war, i can just dock pod->sit in new battleship->undock battleship, my opponents cannot do this without moving all their assets to our station).it's perfectly valid.we do not need victory conditions; if someone wants to pursue a war forever, then so be it, he should have the right to. take it to him and make it impossible for him to live with the wardec, or, alternatively, hire mercs to take him out, and keep hiring them.the whole 'eve needs to cater to x' or 'we don't want to force playstyles' talk is bs - eve is a computer game with its own ruleset. nobody is forcing you to play eve, but by playing, you have to acknowledge it's a game with certain rules and objectives. pvp is a central part of it, there's no 'non-pvp' playstyle in eve much like there's no 'non-pvp' playstyle in multi-player doom.sure, you can play it to pick up the next gun, but don't be suprised when someone shoots you in the face. or back."
"agreed.this is a game, with its own rule sets. so far as i can tell, no-one is saying \"cater\" to this or that group, just that the war-dec system needs to be re-evaluated. right now, there certainly is a \"non-pvp\" play style in eve. its npc corps and hi-security space. thousands of players there... while pvp is a central part of eve, its certainly not the only part. ccp has made it that way. and even there, pvp is possible, if your willing to take the security hit and loss of a craft to concord. i most certainly am not in favor of removing danger from hi-sec - keeps it interesting... if someone wishes to war-dec someone forever, right now, they can. there are however, mechanisms (exploits, whatever you want to call it) that increase the isk cost to run those wars.face it, \"empires\" don't become empires by allowing unrestrained combat wherever, whenever. this is reflected in eve-o by the \"war-dec\" system. which is what this thread is about, the need to have it reexamined."
"what about some sort of new corperate skill 'imperial contacts'it grants sub-concord level npc assistance when attacked, rising with level to quite something quite tough in the end. wouldnt stop wars but would definitely give more of an advantage to the aggressed. would make ganking unarmed ships in a single cruiser impossible even in war but would not stop a fleet.of course the argument is irrelevant anyway there are only 2 types of people in hisec anyway those who want it to be a free fire zone and those who want no pvp there at all"
"but it's working as intended for the most part. any serious retooling of the wardec system is not necessary, as it is working as intended. npc corps and high-security space and mission grinding is a \"non-pvp\" play style until someone suicides your ship, as you pointed out yourself.which are rather borked, i agree. but these are fine details - wardeccing as a system works rather fine, with a few annoying bits. fundamental changes such as 'objectives' are hardly necessary."
"agreed, there has to be some way to make this a little bit less time consuming."
"i set up a small pos on sisi to see what my own pos would be like, and setting the thing up took a ridiculous amount of time. allow the tower to anchor and online multiple mods at once, that way you wouldn't have to sit idle for hours to click 20 times."
"damn poses even fueling is a pain in the ass"
"also why not have the anchoring skill give some functional bonus to the speed of anchoring/onlining pos modules."
"yeah, pos interfaces could use some love."

"more trit mined by the veldnaught means less profit for the macro miners."
"just vote yes to this."
"only has benefits! great stuff"
"i'm totally against this proposed change. as i've said, the pirates already have things going for them in their favor, the only thing you could do more for the pirates is to give all of them an \"i win\" button. making local an \"optional\" channel will only make things perilous for the non-pirate players."
"i'm not even a pirate and i lol'd at this.when you enter low sec/0.0 you are agreeing that you are a viable target to those players who want to shoot people so you should always be ready to defend yourself.i have done a lot of cov ops work for my current/previous corps and the only time i worry is when jumping into a system which may/may not be camped on tother side, if local is hot then i have ways of getting to next gate/wherever without putting myself in danger however if local is empty i just warp to next gate.if i have no idea how many people are in local then i have to fly by the seat of my pants in every system surely this is only a good things as it make life more fun/dangerous.entering lowsec or 0.0 and moaning you have been killed is ridiculous because eve is all about the intel.play smart, adapt to the surroundings."
"hey look all the carebears are still nerd raging and haven't contributed anything to the thread except whining. even if this change made it easier to gank miners/ ratters etc, (which it would not), pvp'ers would actually want to hang around where their buddies are ratting/mining in order to protect them and get fights at the same time. you must admit that to see a group of industrialists and a group of pvp'ers working together is rare in this game, and to me that is quite absurd. why are things like this? because if you want to be 100% completely safe in 0.0, you can be if you know what you are doing. basically what you are saying is this:\"i want all the rewards and none of the risk\" in an area that is designed to be a risk/reward environment.as co-ceo of a corporation, the idea of my logistics and pvp players having a reason to work closer together a) makes sense, and b) makes my heart sing with joy.scenario: there is no such thing as local chat and 'mr jones' rat killer extraordinaire is happily blasting away at some serpentis in his laser raven without a care in the world. a crow warps in and a rapier decloaks 15km's away from him because he was too lazy to be watching his scanner. luckily he was aligned, he hits warp and is gone before either can lock him.so basically i am saying that any argument you big girls have brought to the table is not a solution to the discussion at hand. get a better argument or get out of my thread."
"there should not be any mandatory chat channel that auto-shows everyone who's joined. the intel function of the current local should be performed by an improved (but still limited in range and other functionality) ship's scanner.let me reiterate: a constellation chat as described by the op is a very bad idea (as bad as current local)."
"i vote no and here is why. you can spend long amounts of time scanning in local and find dozens of ships on scanner. how am i supposed to know if those ships are being flown, or if they are parked or what? i don't want to come into every system and ask \"is anyone in here?\" and have to constantly scan to find a target and see if it is actually moving. local is fine the way it is. you say it helps the miner, not really... the miner will have to constantly scan if someone could be warping in on him. helps the potential attacker? i disagree, you just made him have to scan local to find out if anyone is actually in it now, then pinpoint him and this just adds time to his overall game play. where as previously he could just warp into a system, see zero targets, and move on. i can agree with your point that it provides information that there are \"people\" in the system but you don't neccessarily know where and what they might be flying, or if they are cloaked etc. it doesn't give that much intel, just a heads up \"hey pal, you're not alone in here.\" so again, i vote no. leave it alone. *also please notice i know how to spell and i am giving you a reason per your request op. edit: what may be a solution, is a ticker that actually shows how many people are actually in the system currently, but not who. but again. i have been playing for a few years and this is a constant that i and many other players are used to. removing it is kind of like losing a thumb."
"why couldn't local work the way like many other chats? as in - only show those who chat.maybe keep number of people in system still there though."
"pro local change,against constellation change."
"even if they did nothing but boost the base optimal by 10km, i'd be far happier."
"a quick glance reveals that minmatar encryption methods is required to invent t2 tracking computers and tracking enhancers, so i'd say they are fairly focused on tracking (not to mention that autocannons have pretty good tracking).my main issue is that the 1400mm artillery uses so much powergrid in comparison to the fitting grid of all minmatar battleships, meaning that you are almost always better fitting 1200mm instead.all the use of battleship-size minmatar weapons are exactly what i expect from them: high alpha, low dps. if anything, i'd have to say that im only in favour of a possible grid reduction on artillery fitting, if any change at all."
"artillery needs a boost at all sizes, just 1400mm is the most visible because it has the largest gap when compared to rails and beams. especially now that there are ranged bonused ships that use those weapons. additionally, the issue isn't entirely with the guns themselves (though they do need 75% better tracking and 10% more range and maybe a bit more damage). the main comparison people do with 1400mm arty is the sniper battleships and the tempest is just terrible compared to a rokh or apoc, and is even bad when compared to a mega or abaddon. the tempest is the only one that can't dd tank and hit to 150km. it relies on midslot tracking/opt modules where as the others rely on lowslot mods which are far superior. also, they use too much grid, or alternately the bss doesn't have enough grid. just freeing up the low slot that we currently need for an rcu2 would help slightly.fix all arty and fix minmatar battleships."
"i fully support this issue."
"this thread shows exactly why having to post to show support isn't the world's greatest idea. . .they certainly have made improvements, but it still occasionally (and randomly) decides that one login isn't enough, but 15 is just right."

"there's a search function? where?"
"the one i'm referring to is at the top of the right sidebar on all pages. you'd think it'd search the item database and guides and stuff, but it only seems to return forum hits from about 2005. the real search function is at www.eve-search.com, of course, but as useful as chribba is to have around, we shouldn't need third-party tools to implement a forum search algorithm worth a damn."
"hello? this shouldn't even be something we have to ask for. it's like asking nicely to please have your car fixed the right way."
"i support the discussion of this issue with ccp."
"yes a capital hi sec miner would be great while we are at it can we add better ore to lv 4 missions? or have mining missions that dont suck like a hoover?"
"it's quite simple.what we need to do, is;- get rid of macros (mining will get a lot more profitable over time, as there's none to \"seed\" the mineral market 23/7)- heavily limit the 0.0/lowsec minerals you get from refining stuff. (megacyte and zydrine) (would make lowsec mining more attractive)thoughts?"
"i personally think mining yield and such are fine and i'm quite happy with my ore/time return.what i am not happy about is the severe lack of ships/equipment which i can use when mining. where are the named variant strip miners with lower fitting requirements and maybe a little better range? where the faction mods? we received mlus like this but where's the rest? and i want more mining platform choices. why can't ore have 4 mining cruisers each with a mix of pro/con? one with a 5% mining laser range per level bonus with more cargo space or one with less range and space but fast as a nano frig for the ninja miners? give me options from ore (true mining ships, not a vexor with a mining bonus as a work around) so that i can improve my mining experience that doesn't involve increasing yields. as it stands now, once you start a mining career your only general choices are mining barge or exhumer. no other race versions, etc. just like pvp some people would prefer range over yield(damage) or speed over yield(damage) in some circumstances but miners don't have these options.as a combat pilot i can have my choice of 40 ships with which to pve or pve just in the frig class in the same amount of training time as it takes to train for an exhumer (all racial frigs to 5, assault ships to 4, interceptors to 4). the more choices i have means more fun in being able to find the right ship for the right environment. but with mining there are very few choices. and a pet peeve.....where's the mining command ship? i don't think they require all command ships to remove their weapons slots in order to provide gang boosts so why are all the mining gang boosting ships unable to fit mining lasers? where's the cs hulk with 2x strip miners and one gang link slot? a 2-man pvp/pve gang can benefit when a cs is one of the ships so why should mining require 6 miners before a cs pilot will be more beneficial than having them mining?"
"well, considering, i guess no one wants to really know or ask from the developer what is the future of the t2 bpos will be? i mean we have a thread full of whinage, screaming, and yelling, to removed them - yet, not one of those whiners came here - even though i linked the thread there - to actually do such a simple thing as to ask?!!!anyway, if you actually want to know what do the developers think about t2 bpos, not engage in pointless discussion about the merits, then show support and request for a new dev blog on t2 bpos."
"awww, you forgot to stipulate that there shouldnt be any 'invention vs bpo isk profit' calculations, so expect this thread to get derailed by all the john maynard keyes wannabes like every other thread on the topic.it would be nice to hear from this devs on this topic more often than once a year at fanfest, its obviously one of the topics they won't touch with a 10 foot pole in the forums, so csm, any chance the topic can be riased?"
"while i support this and would like to have a dev response, i do not think we will get one (here) until and unless the csm brings the issue to ccp...perhaps the issue should be a request that the csm bring to ccp that a weekly dev blog or response to a player defined issue (in this case the future of t2 bpo's). problem then being how do the players define an issue to be discussed..."
"sure, i'd like to know what the devs have planned for bpos."
"supported"
"i would love to see one, though i doubt it would help. the whiners will continue to whine, dev blog or no dev blog. at least then i'll have a one-link answer to them."
"supportedi stand for bringing those bpos back into game. however instead of the lottery it would be nice the be able to get them through achieving high ranks in faction militia or through lp stores (additionaly having a higher faction standings would be required to be able to get better bpos).invention is great i believe... though in my opinion while it its a chance based thing it is not much interresting for some of us. imho as it is chance based bpcs from invention should be given ome extra stats rather than minus (like base me:20 rather than me:-5).that would make getting bpc still a bit profitable, while researching t2 bpos should be very hard and expensive :)the thing that some peoples had the chance to get the bpos and now no-one else can is a bit unfair to me.thats my opinion :)"
"i support the issue of asking the dev team to make it known to the community at this time the plans for the t2 bpo's.p.s. don't forget to tick the support box or it won't show as support."
"tech 2 bpos reward the people that put the time and effort into the game.when ccp decided that they were going to remove tech 2 bpos from being brought into the game, nobody received any more tech 2 bpos.that is fair.ccp has also openly stated that they will not be reinstating the t2 lottery."
"agreed please buff"
"i was quite excited when i heard about these ships and totally disappointed when they finally came out. the jump drive uses way too much fuel, and for the cost of the ship, it really isn't that much beter."
"i agree! the gap is too large. going from a 1m isk ship to a almost 1b isk ship is not an easy task. a ship around 100m and 70-100k m3 would be great.great idea!"
"having just recently gotten my freighter on an alt i realize just how big that thing is compared to the medium amount i need to move...so i of course support this as well :d"

"if someone was banned for anything out of game, that wasn't illegal, that doesn't involve time codes, yes it should be reviewed, there is no pandora's box thereedit: basicaly what im saying is you dont know its opening pandora's box, id ont know of anyone else ever who has been banned for something out of game that didn't invovle time codes, even if there is more then him, we dont know that, you should error on the side of protecting the playerbase then error on the side of ccp is right because kugu proved already they arnt' always rightedit2: the whole reason the council was created was to prevent abuse from ccp employee's on the game, to me that should include looking into kugu getting banned because from my point of view thats exactly what it is"
"baemp"
"posting in a thread i support."
"i guess the point is that at the time he was being banned ccp was pretty much going emo on his a**. and they basicly banned him for giving them a hard time. a good reason would have been because he posted rl information on the forums but so did molle at the time. and he didn't get banned for that. (i won't link to the blog where the most of this is explained but it isn't hard to find.)i'm no fan of the man nor his play style but what ccp did was/is wrong imho. and i'd applaud the csm if they try and sort this out with ccp."
"i think you misunderstand the purpose of the council. the council is there to review game-related issues brought up by the players and determine which are worthy of ccp's attention. as has been pointed out by those on both sides of the argument, this is not a game-related issue, everything about it happened outside of the game, and it in no way affects the functioning of the game. this is a customer service issue. if kugu has a problem with it, he needs to work through the channels of customer service. if people feel strongly enough about it to support him, they should write letters to ccp's customer service department stating that support. this should not be brought to a player council designed for reviewing game-related issues.it most definetely is \"opening pandora's box,\" as you are asking the csm to consider the case of an individual player and grant preferential treatment based on the popularity of the individual's case. it is opening the door to potential corruption of the csm through favoring individuals, it is setting a precedent of favoritism to the popular and well-known, and it is involving the csm in issues beyond the scope of where they should be focusing their time.as i said before, if the csm wants to push ccp to develop a review process available to all banned players, that may still be stretching their jurisdiction, but i could find acceptable. the csm should definetely not start looking at individual cases, it's not their place, and in the end it's not within their power to do anything about it. the csm exists to suggest ideas to ccp about how to improve their game, not to tell them how to run their business."
"i believe that a clearer banning process and implementation should be looked at along with appeals..."
"i wouldn't disagree there, but that is not what you are supporting by giving this thread a thumbs up."
"supported."
"unban the guy. he's a genuine eve martyr as far as i am concerned."
"this is actually what the csm was created for. this incident should certainly be reviewed, as its the big things that was the cause for csm to be started. the members of the csm should look at ccp's actions here and see if they were reasonable."
"supporting because i think the whole business was shady."
"the whole purpose of the csm is oversight, thats why the idea came up, i dunno what you think it is but it was created in response to dev's playing the game and cheating while they doing it, that oversight should include dealing with the emo reaction that was banning kugu plane a simple as its directly involved with the reason the csm was created, and the only unresolved issue involving the incident still out there"
"yes"
"given this:i'm voting yes, because i'd like a more up-to-date response than 2005. i'd also like to hear a good argument as to why a 'next skill' causes any issues with character farming and ebay and so on.btw, a workaround is not a solution. eve is still irritating at times because of its intrusion into life when you just don't need it. heck at least in the other mmos where i have to grind xp (and i hate grinding) i'm doing so on my terms."
"my support."
"doesn't even need to be a full queue. i'd be happy just being able to set a 'backup skill' that kicks in whenever the primary skill i'm training runs out."

"yes, let's hear ccp's reasons for not having one. i'm sure we could work together to smooth out details to prevent it from being abused, it's just rather hard to discuss something when one party isn't saying anything..."

"ive done a bit of ganking in empire over the years and the risk/time/reward does not lend itself to removing insurance at all, well unless your a total empire carebear mission runner looking for a 100% safe environment.in fact the gankers need a boost as less and less empire rats are dropping faction loot."

"i agree. mission runners should not get insurance."
"yes, a thousand times, yes!"
"the dev's considered removing learning skills from the game but at present they have no plans for removing them. i really dont see what the problem with learning these skills are. learning skills were introduced to increase the speed of which you learn they dont slow you down at all. before learning skills were introduced the attributes were no different and learning skills were there as an investment in time which helped players learn new skills if they took time to do so. with this in mind i find it a difficult pill to swallow when i see players say that they slow down you overall learning as they are seen as mandatory. the net effect is that increase your sp per hour not reduce.i can see the differing points of view in this thread and i can understand that some players may be put off with the prospect of putting 2 weeks into learning skills i however have seen most of the players i have talked to been actively encouraged by learning skills and feel they add to the game. i feel i have kept and introduced new players to the game not lost them.the eve community has mixed emotions about learning skills. i cant see learning skills being removed from the game and if they were you can be assured that ccp would reimburse the investment made. saying otherwise is outright foolish.there is one possible work around for learning skills if they do eventually fall into the grey. what could be done is to give all players in eve 800000 sp and include this in the new character creation and invest these skill points into learning skills. this way new players would gain a great deal jumping to 1.6 million skill points and they wont need to spend a great deal of time in learning skills. older players such as myself will almost not notice an 800000 increase and would in fact serve to close the gap a little between veteran and new players which in itself is an issue for debate. ccp did do this once before in a patch not long after i started playing. it was the most fair and equitable method conceivable at the time."
"maybe you should go back and read the part where i trained the skills myself, past tense, been there, done that. i think that buys me a little authority on the matter.so far as compensating those of us who have trained the learning skills, i gave my suggestions for it. i don't think that it is a bad idea to do so, my point was just that i hated having to go through those skills so much that i personally could care less whether i was compensated as long as it meant the skills would be gone. i never said to take away anything from those with the skills, just said that personally i would feel little loss if the skills were removed without compensation.\"we did it, so should you\" is not a valid reason for a decision. if there is a better way to handle the situation, why not take it?"
"no support for this idea.i would infact suggest even more advanced learning skills being introduced"
"the role of the csm chair was intended to be a person who simply controlled the duration of the discussion and made a call to vote. they were not supposed to be the one that set the agenda and decided how the various issues would be approached and solved. it was not an administrative position as much as it was an organizational position.jade is trying to make it an administrative position where he has power over the others. more equal than his equals, so to speak."

"he's allowed to talk about anything he said himself i dont really see an issue with it i can understand if he was showing us your e-mails or anyone else's emails but showing his own is perfectly fine."
"you of all people talking about something being unprofessional is peak irony at this point."
"well you said he told you what i said too? i didn't give permission for him to talk about my emails."
"the general gist of the information is not what's at stake here the only thing would be an actual quote."
"not true - a private list is private, and breaking privacy on such a list short of admission of criminal acts(and i mean real crime, not the odd joint or jaywalk) is a really low thing to do - both on darius' part and on yours. if you can't keep a secret, you won't get to see any in future. besides, breaking privacy on what happens on such a list just shows a lack of imagination - we have a history in the csm now of issues being added via csm member request on the forums. if darius wanted to ***** about jade not adding this issue, he should have just calmly posted a link to it in the meeting 5 thread on jita park, and asked for it to be heard at that meeting. the private is kept private, and the same ends are achieved. everybody who needs to know what happened still does, and he comes out of it looking better and embarrassing jade even more to the other csms that would be the case otherwise. not only is it stupid and immature to break privacy on the list, it shows a terrible deficiency of deftness."
"wow!!! hello pot meet kettle! dude you make gw bush look like a einstein!"
"anyone else on the council can talk about their e-mails just fine, and we all know anything and everything you've been saying has been footstomping and temper tantrums."
"if the majority of csm believes you incapable of doing your job and disruptive you should step down, it shouldn't have to fall to ccp to tell you that."
"there has never been any, implied or otherwise, expectation of privacy on the mailing list. i talked with people about what we were discussing, as i'm sure others have. i have friends. i tell them what i'm doing. now if i went and forwarded all the emails i'd agree that would have been wrong. but merely saying \"hey here's what i was discussing\" is far from a breach of privacy and i submit that the only reason people are taking umbrage with it is that they're ashamed of themselves and their actions. they should be.:edit: i'd like to note as well that you were aware of this before ever posting your response and acting ignorant because i told you. yesterday. i also included everyone else on the mailing list in that statement. oh my god ive done it again!!!!"
"but it is his job to tell them how to behave and they have been misbehaving naughty little children and are deserving of a time-out"
"but but but... democracy?"
"i think you should view the terms of service you agreed with when you signed up to that mailing list darius. serenity is the provider of that mailing list and you should go and have a read of his last message before you continue this line of argument.you might also want to review your decision to raise the publication of emails from that list on sundays agenda. up to you, but might save us all some time."
"if you mentioned it to aprudena with the expectation of privacy then i'll largely let you off the hook - i don't mind confidantes. but it's still on you to make sure that it doesn't go public. also, i'm not sure that you're referring to me with the edit - we've never had a conversation of any type that wasn't through these forums, so i doubt that you've told em anything."
"are you threatening to have him sued?"
"you read my response to this exact question yesterday. that's fine though i'm not afraid of it being public. i republished nothing. therefore i've violated no terms of service. if serenity wants to remove the email account i don't need and never asked for that's his business. one less mailbox for me to monitor. i still intend to motion to have the emails published on sunday. it's not mine or the csms problem if serenity's mail system ends up being incompatible with the needs of the csm. in that case we picked the wrong tool for the job."
"sorry on the last point. i was talking to jade. regarding the expectation of privacy... the conversation was mentioned on a private forum but so what? if i decide to share my discussions with others that's my prerogative. i'm a public official. my voters have a right to know what the council is doing."
"quality drama here. moar plox"
"i assumed something like that had happened. as for the \"it's my right\" defence, it probably is, but i wasn't arguing legalities or even moralities. i was just saying that's not how you should do business - public is public, private is private, and never the twain shall meet. even if you had the right to republish every csm internal email of your own accord, you would not be right to do so. it's one of those unwritten rules about how to conduct yourself in general, and in politics in particular - don't rat people out and break confidences without a damn good reason."
"i had no reason to believe any confidences existed. now the point is moot because i've made it clear that nothing said to me is private when it comes to council discussion. again... nothing whatsoever save some of my own emails was published. all of this was known and explained to the entire council yesterday. a good question would be why is jade feigning shock and indignance today? this is old news at this point."
"as long as you've made that clear, fine. i'm sure the 8-man mailing list will get lots of traffic. as for jade's reaction, i haven't seen too much shock, and the indignance could well be legit."
"here i'll quote the bits i'm referring to for you:"
"not much shock thats true. and not much actual drama. i think its poor to break confidences once agreed though."
"okay, yeah, if what you say is true then he's hamming that up."
"don't imply that i've agreed to anything. i haven't and you know that. i said as much in the email you're pretending i didn't send yesterday."
"i wasn't referring to your jade quotes with the \"if what you say is true\", i was referring to the bit about how the council already knew."
"we have a long way to go. i bolded where we are at. the silly part is jade has brought this grief upon his or her self.* denial* anger* bargaining* depression* acceptance"
"well, add this to another reason jade will be voting against releasing them."
"they're my emails. jade's consent doesn't come into play. nor does anyone else's."
"quick, somebody go back and find those posts where jade was saying he supported full transparency and such. i'm getting lazy. also, i support my own topic."
"o/\o"
"what is the constitution that jade keeps talking about? was it written by the council? was it written by ccp? can anyone link to it?"
"their is no constitution he made it up."
"i guess we all know that feeling."
"but i think we can all say that a tool certainly was picked for this job....supported."
"i care alot about this game, which is why i invest alot of my personal time in it. jade has shown his character, and it is one that is not suitable for running on the chair of a council that i have entrusted the future of my game to. supported."
"jade is a loose cannon. he should be taken off the case."
"i haven't really cared about this csm and decided to poke into it. i read 4 threads thoroughly and i've gotta agree, jade can't handle power or things beyond his control.maybe that's not enough to say anything on the matter, but that's what i've gathered."
"clearly unsuitable for the task,"
"from what i have seen on jades behaviour i must support the removal of jade.i will be very highly surprised if anything comes of this though."
"any place i can find the chatlogs of this event?"
"i am not exactly known to be jade's bumchum but this is taking on ridicolous proportions. i think the message that people are unhappy with jade's conduct during the last meeting has come across by now.if this persists all the important issues will get burried in all the 'outrage!' threads. or maybe that is exactly the plan: to just undermine the csm and make sure it gets nothing done, which would be a shame as it is in general a good idea."
"after reading the logs, different threads and observing the behavior of the main actors of this \"drama\", i wanted to make a comedy post here, asking to not throw j.constantine out of his (so loved) chair just for the sake of the good lulz.but i came across a (now locked)thread in an external forums (shc) about this csm thing. i was literaly shocked to see the posts of that guy there, and i was even more disgusted when i saw his website linked there (concerning his \"roleplay\").so, i decided to come here and vote against that..guy.not only because of his \"roleplay\" choices, but mainly because of his psychotic dictatorial behavior, and his inaptitude to handle a process who will maybe decide of our future gameplay.now, to get back on his roleplay choices :i would like to tell him that it's the kind of stuffs that made a bad name of roleplay in general, and you must not forget that there is also kids playing this game. roleplaying in an internet spaceship game should be about : spaceships, politics and economics. nothing else.(lets cut short your paranoia : i'm not a goon alt. i think i even shooted at them once.)"
"if it was only the last meeting things would have blown over by now. but jade keeps putting more fuel on the fire with practically every post he makes.he should have just said sorry and moved on."
"jade seriously. step down you have gone way way to far. your refusal to even look at the fact your wrong. you are a goonswarm hater. you see them everywhere you turn. do you check under your bed too? read up on mccarthyism. and read up on how much of a nut he was. your rite up there with him. seek some rl professional help."
"actually he said \"screw you\" (or words to that effect) and then moved on.unfortunately the rest of you did not so he is still responding to your crap, he should have joined goons as the sort of behavior they are criticizing in him is something they applaud in and from their members."
"the whole idea was to make the csm a channel whereby we (paying customers) may voice our issues with ccp via community reps. after reading the logs of the meeting where all this occurred and the subsequent postings by jade on this subject, i've come to realise that the csm is chaired by someone in it for his own benefit and who has no intention of being a neutral chair.basically, get out. if you keep this crap up the csm will get nowhere."
"disappointing behaviour."
"is/should it even be possible for the council to alter a position determined by popular vote in the csm elections?i'd say no.also, goons continuing to stir **** up just shows that despite all their talk, they are undemocratic. they are all in favor of democratic elections, they are not in favor of the results of democratic elections."
"after giving this a long thought i just started to wonder if jade seems to realize that he has a huge responsibility on his shoulders representing all those who voted for him. and same goes for the rest of the csm.you all have to learn to work together and really think about improving eve by representing the views of the players.as csm, your actions have rl consequences with possible influence of jobs at ccp.think about it."
"what's kept my attention is how jade has managed to make goons look good with his actions. considering they are generally a group of rowdy hooligans who happily play to the limits of allowable behaviour in game (hi2u jihadswarm and recruitment channel people), this is quite an accomplishment.i'm also gonna disagree with some of the views in this thread about darius being disruptive and trying to break the csm process. if anything, he's trying to get its sorry ass up and running and looking to actually get stuff done.jade, can you either sort this mess out asap or just give up the chair to someone who will actually treat the position properly? the csm are the players chance to voice their issues to ccp, through the csm, and you have so far managed to sandbag it terribly."
"inanna had every right to act as she did. i think she acted very reasonably after having one vote editorialised and then being locked out of channel (apparently accidentally) for a revote.after reading all this thread and all the logs (good grief), yes."
"i'd say yes, lets go for a rl analogy here. if your president/leader of choice goes bat**** insane in the middle of his/her term and starts firing nukes off all over the place do the vice-president/leader and all the other elected leaders say \"oh crap, we voted for this idiot we got two more years of this\"? no! there are ways of removing incompetents. as there should be a way of removing jade."
"*yawn* i cant belive you started yet another thread about it. since he got elected as chair people started campaigning to get him out of this position. the only thing jade should be sorry about is giving this bunch another reason by an not needed mute. even tt and verone (who stated that he is happy that he stepped out of csm so he cant be that worried about the outcome of it)jumped into it crying \"censorship\" where there was moderating and waving their names to score some easy eve-celeb points.also, ccp wake up and help the guys to sort some basic rules out. if this fails, its to a great part your fault, giving it not enough consideration. dont think you can hide behind the poor sods (thats all the csm reps)who stood up and tried (more or less) to make this work.no support for this. only ccp should be allowed to replace the chair. also, ccp should indeed get a dev to do chair as no player will be neutral and able to defend against claims to be biased."
"i am sure that if jade does go \"bat ****\" insane and starts trashing ccp offices they will do something about it. but until then comparing his muting of a disruptive member to mass world wide murder is just pathetic."
"not supported. i<U+FFFD>m a pretty new player and all these things about goons or whatever don<U+FFFD>t interest me.what interests me is, if someone speaks mature (so far as it is possible in a game environment), with reason and is open for dialogue and not just sending his opinions.another point is that this is a destrucive issue. a construcive would have been to propose another csm member for chair. but even if: the issue about how the chair is chosen out is -already- on the agenda with ccp as far as i understood."
"do you fear the apocalypse?"
"keep posting you are giving a good example for your \"bat **** crazy\" theory."
"i was giving an extreme example of why most votes isn't the be-all and end-all of a good leader. get over yourself you oversensitive crybaby."
"yep the \" electable chair\"issue was raised by me (ironically). it was posted on the assembly hall for 7 days public discussion (tick)it got public support and csm member endorsement (tick)raised on the agenda in a formal csm meeting (tick)got voted for by the csm committee 4/2/2 (tick)i documented it yesterday and sent it to the csm secretary (tick)and its getting submitted to ccp 7 days in advance of the conference as specified in our docs (tick)this is how you get issues that can impact the constitution/foundation documentation of the csm into formal discussion. i've explained this quite a few times. what would have been nice to see on the agenda as well would have been issues raising the question of a non-voting ccp provided chair. a rotating chair, proposals of that sort. i think there is a problem with a voting csm member acting in the role of chair, and its something we need to consider, but we do need to raise issues in the proper fashion.this kind of thread (op post) doesn't help much because its just a lot shouting and no csm advocacy. as long as it doesn't gain 5% of total player base in support (or specific csm advocacy) it won't get added to the agenda automatically. but even getting a thread like this onto issues agenda doesn't mean the issue (itself) could get voted on there and then in any case, the principle of whether we in the csm think its an important matter for the player base as a whole will be considered on the csm and a vote held on the subject of whether we commend the issue to ccp's attention: if it gets through that vote then it must then be raised in the csm/ccp discussions at the formal conference since ccp need to have final sign off on any of these constitutional changes.i'd like to see more people actively trying to understand the process at work here since it would render the apparent motivation behind a lot of these threads void and let us see more important issues getting the air time they deserve."
"you think this isn't important?if csm wouldn't be able to get their act together all issues wouldn't get handled properly.you don't have to agree or even like each other. just that you accept your responsibility to give this your utmost best to make it work. that applies to all members. that you owe to all the people that voted for you."
"(sorry, the morgenreiter was the first try char...)just some thoughts out of political experience:the chairman/woman of an institution (the council in this case) and of a meeting don<U+FFFD>t have to be the same.in rl-politics the chair of an institution, it can be several but this makes some things more complicated, is the representative for outer relations, like media and so on.the chair of a conference can rotate or be elected at the beginning of each session.a big question is, if the council really must publish the whole log of a meeting, this is a source of endless.....like it is now. a short protocol is much more useful, even for the public. these are normally to be confirmed at the beginning of the following meeting. the discussions to the issues happen already here in the forum. if the council spends much time discussing/fighting with each other, its the councils business.transparency would be given if it stood there how each member voted on an issue.it would certainly reduce the gossip factor. the question is if this is wanted.i<U+FFFD>d really like to see what kind of figure other csm members would give as moderators. to the question of alternates as substitutes: it<U+FFFD>s the most normal thing of the world that when a regular member steps out, an alternate moves in and vice versa, when the regular comes back. on big party conferences you just cant sit there three days 16 hours each at all time for example.by the way: many seem to think of the council as some party thing like \"highsecpeopleparty\", \"pvpersunion\", certain alliances and so on.the mechanics of the council and its election are not exactly designed in this way and this has not only consequences for the questions concerning alternates.there is a gap that needs clarification over long."
"no. i like jade. some good stuff in the manifesto."
"nope this thread isn't important. latest meeting of the csm thats what people getting down to the hard work of actually being csm reps looks like."
"holy sweet jesus batman.this is absolutely ridiculous. ccp should reduce the number of standings slots not increasei can't believe the nonsense and ridiculousness by rp nrds people, of course cva and paxton buddies are all for this to keep people from shooting them.the problem with 0.0 in this game is the napfailtrain, 300-400 man super gangs of failure. blues should be extremely restricted based on alliance size. if you can't get what you want done on your own or with a proportionate amount of \"friends\" you shouldnt be able to wither up and call on every failtard out there to serve your intereststhe servers can't handle, the player base cant stand the lag, and if there were a simple overview change to limit naps from being removed, these nod crashing lamegangs wouldn't happen. good thing the csm has no power other than to act like a internet beauracracy."
"i'm with matrix. cut the ****ing naptrains already, *less* standings slots."
"with heavy missiles hitting outside web range, no real need to fit a web tbh, with jav missiels they are also fast enough to hit most nanoships.a pdu and a rig are better than multiple rcus as in the other setups... and a pdu actually helps shield tanks and recharges cap.there's another rig slot in the fit that can be used to fit an anti-em shield rignothing wrong with using a named mwd, as it still gets the job done, usues less pg and cpu, and uses less cap.edit:above there was a sugestion made to compare using the long range turrets vs the short range in the comparison, think it is valid as heavy missiles hit from further away, using the close range guns in the comparison you dont actually calculate the cap/time used in getting in range for the guns, and the cap used staying in range. while the longer range guns can hit from about the same distance as hml's can.and, why so intence on fitting a gang mod on the nh when the vulture was designed perfectly for them?"
"what you are conveniently ignoring is that the nighthawk is an anti-support ship. the very ships it is designed to target are fast enough to nearly entirely negate missile damage thanks to a generally low missile explosion velocity. a web is actually far more important than a scram for the nighthawk. fitting a scram without a web is simply stupid, as frigate-sixed ships will simply ignore your damage, get out of 20k, and then wave goodbye as they warp off.that isnt really the freaking point, is it? the point is that other command ships dont have to waste slots or rigs to make things fit. a basic setup for the nighthawk requires (as in not optional) two or three fitting mods or rigs. other command ships can fit similar setups with one or none.read above. other command ships wont have to sacrifice even one rig slot. why should the nighthawk? (oh, and ps. his posted setup doesnt even fit. the nighthawk will have to use two fitting mods and rigs to even fit such a pathetic setup.)true. but other command ships dont have to use named mwds, so again, read above.because the nighthawk is the only missile-based command ship. some people spec certain weapons and expect the ships theyve specd for to actually work. however, lets theoretically fit a nighthawk and all the other command ships without a gang mod. guess what? the nighthawk is still exactly as far behind all the other command ships as it was with the gang mod."
"please, can we get away from the pve fixation? this is pvp. missiles are very poor long-range weapons, despite what eft says, because of flight time and target velocity issues. especially on a ship lacking missile velocity and explosion velocity bonuses. the nighthawk is best regarded as a close range cs whether fitting hmls or hams, broadly comparable to a pulse abso or sleipnir.as for the gang mod comment, oh come on. not only is it the nighthawk's role to fit one: \"role bonus: 99% reduction in warfare link module cpu need\", but also, as we've shown many, many times, the other field cs fit a gang mod with only minor fitting compromises. is it really too much to ask for equality for the nighthawk? or is the nighthawk just a bad joke designed to prop the rcu ii market up?"
"let's look at, say, scourge precision heavy missile, base speed: 3,250 m/s. base flight time 5.25sec. add skills in there and that's one fast and far-flying missile. most nano-ships do not orbit with their mwd on, other than in some cases, and with most of them even when they do mwd, they will get hit with these misseils, they are afraid of missile ships for this reason.and, warp dissy range is 24km, not 20km.fast ships tend to stay outside web range, so kinda a wasted mid.not every ship in eve is the same. keeps thing diverse and makes you use your brain when fitting.so? fit what ya gotta fit!false nh is notthe only missile cs, the damnation also is missile spec'd."
"missiles aren't bad for pvp and im not ****in usin eft. ive played this game for the past few years and can tell yo uby experence that missiles arent too terrable for pvp.all battlecruisers have that same roll, but do you see every brutix, ferox, and proph fitting gang mods? nope.and yes, it is too much to ask for.just came back from sisi and it took multiple bc's to take out a nighthawk, it absorbed more than 50k damage easy."
"posting in this ****storm because hes banned again"
"/signedits not just the nighthawk that is issue, the caldari hacs are awful. the eagle is the worst hac in the game bar maybe the cerb, which is paper thin and a flawed concept. sniping with missiles is silly, especially with the magic 4000 m/s where missiles no longer deal damage. fix precision, fix the eagle, fix the cerb, fix our command ships. caldari uses the worst 2 weapon systems in the game right now, long range missiles, and rail guns. -.-"
"what he said ^also:sleipnir: 8 + 5 + 5 = 18 slots, 7 turret points, 5% to rof, 5% do dmg, 40m3 of dronesastarte: 7 + 4 + 6 = 17 slots, 7 turret points, 10% do dmg, 50m3 of dronesabsolution: 7 + 3 + 7 = 17 slots, 6 turret points, 5% to dmg, 5% to rof, 25m3 of dronesnighthawk: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17 slots, 6 missile points, 5% to rof, 5% to kinetic dmg only, 25m of dronesso, one more missile point of nhawk and one more turret slots on abso and enoughr pg and cpu to fit it correctly plz ;)"
"i use missiles exclusively in pvp. i think i know what i'm talking about. they're excellent close-range weapons, but rather poor at range. in any case, a nighthawk has no way of keeping range, thanks to all those rcus, so typically it will end up fighting at close range anyway.why are you bringing up battlecruisers? the nighthawk is a not a battlecruiser! what is this rubbish?! the relative ease of fitting of gang mods on battlecruisers is as irrelevant as the colour of the sand on the ocean floor! we are talking about the relative balance of fitting of gang mods on field cs, and the nighthawk is far, far out of line.\"multiple bcs to take out a nighthawk\". ok, you really are being thick here. you cannot fit a good tank on a pvp-fit nighthawk. you need to understand why this is, or this thread will be a morass of confusion for you. the nighthawk does not have the pg or medslots to fit a strong tank in pvp. any time you see a nh taking 50k damage, it is a useless-brick, passive-regen tanked pve fit utterly without merit or use in pvp. again, your belief that it is useful indicates that you are still stuck in pve mode.and last but not least...we're currently discussing the relative ease of fitting a gang mod on the field cs. of course it's module-centric, that's the entire bloody point! and even if it wasn't, a nighthawk without a gang mod typically requires fitting mods, in contrast to the other field cs which don't, even when fitting a gang mod. your failure to follow the line of discussion staggers me - you are bringing nothing to this thread but confusion, misdirection and terrible fits that don't fit.*head explodes*late-edit:an extra launcher slot on the nh is not necessary. all is needed is the pg to use the ones that it has."
"so the nighthawk pilot must use a fitting implant instead of a damage or speed or tanking implant that any other command ship pilot could be using? even in your nonsensical \"strategic fitting\" terms, you're once again behind because you're not bringing as much utility to the gang as you could be. even if we're assuming that people are going to have a clone specifically set up for their command ship, lets see what we else we could be doing with that implant slot. oh look, noble zet10/100/1000, which reduces armor/hull repair module duration. so that's the astarte and absolution taken care of. oh look, rogue ay-0/1/2 (ship agility) and ey-0/1/2 (afterburner cap use), both having utility for all four command ships the board but especially good for nano sleipnir. while there's nothing in that sixth slot that's especially good specifically for the nighthawk (even if the agility bonus is always useful), if you plan on flying anything other than ships horrifically short on powergrid the 1/3/5% grid implant is worthless.this is ignoring that mediocre fits that aren't even competitive with other ships of the same class shouldn't be needing a powergrid implant to begin with."
"i really can't believe you posted this. it is so horrifically ignorant i had to read it twice to make sure i wasn't misreading it."
"i support this. as i see it the nh doesn't really have a role outside pve. if you want a bait ship the vulture is better. if you want a buffer tanked damage dealer the drake is better. command ships will always be outclassed by bs in a straight up fight, but they should not be outclassed by t1 battlecruisers."
"thanks for out of context quote. it's just supposed to be a possibility that's more useful than 6% decrease in probing time or whatever other crummy implants are in that slot. but yes, snake omega (rich people) or the agility one are much more useful, and i guess it my fault for not making that clear."
"i agree the nighthawk would need more powergrid."
"i definitly agree with this"
"moar powergrid"
"you entirely ignored my point. fast ships can entirely negate missile damage. check the explosion velocity on scourge precision missiles. tell me, do most frigate-sized ships go faster than that? yes. meaning missiles do no damage to them. they will have to be webbed. regardless, the discussion about fitting a web/scram or not on the nighthawk is pretty much off topic.nice try at avoiding the obvious. ships in eve being diverse and different does not excuse one ship out of a category from not being able to fit a basic setup properly. luckily most people responding to this thread can do math and have reason and logic enough to figure this out. your inability to admit you are wrong (along with erotic irony) is slightly entertaining, not to mention... neither you nor him are fooling myself or others, and you are both keeping the thread bumped.again, that's the whole point, if you would bother engaging your brain. the nighthawk must fit upwards of two or three fitting mods (along with rigs and implants) to even fit what other command ships can fit using no fitting mods, rigs, or implants. if you can't see the issue with that then you are truly and definitively dense (or a troll).great answer. we're talking about caldari/missile spec'd folks here. i didn't think i'd have to spoon feed you and state the obvious. caldari/missile spec'd pilots shouldn't have to cross train for amarr command ships simply because the one ship they have access to has had its powergrid castrated."
"hahaha, so now that erotic botches a setup he thinks nighthawk pilots should (let me get this right) - use a pdu (fitting mod), ancillary rig (fitting rig), and a powergrid implant (fitting implant) to fit an absolutely terrible basic nighthawk setup using all of its lowest powergrid components... and in the meantime, all the other command ships can fit similar setups without the use of a single rig, implant, or fitting mod.seriously, could i ask for a better illustration that the nighthawk needs help?"
"you stated it was the only missile commandship, i was just correcting you."
"a. we're talking about field command ships.b. we're talking about caldari field command ships.it was pretty clear to most anyone what the meaning of my statement was within its context. most people don't get huffy about off-topic semantics when they have a good argument."
"the only one getting \"huffy\" here seems to be you."
"lot of ingorants in this thread trying to defend a gimped ship by claiming that we don't need parity or that it will increase diversity. the fact remains that the nighthawk needs significantly more fitting modules for an equivalent fit than do any other command ships. that is obviously bad. moreover, my argument that the nigthawk shouldn't lose grid compared to the drake has yet to be addressed.are there any other ships that lose grid like that going from t1 to t2?what is a drake fitting that a nighthawk is supposed to ditch? if anything, the nighthawk is basically a tii drake + gang mod. this chart says all that needs to be said:powergrid of tech 1 bc's compared to tech ii versions:hurricane 1350 --> sleipnir 1460myrmidon 1175 --> astarte 1450harbinger 1500 --> absolution 1575drake 850 --> nighthawk 710 (<---huge decrease wtf?)"
"also, yes missiles themselves have all kinds of problems, particularly sniping with missiles or trying to hit nanos with missiles or heavy precision missiles. and yes the cerb is far less good than the vagabond or ishtar or sacrilege. but, this thread is about how bad the nighthawks power grid is: it's a relatively simple and specific fix that i hope to see implemented."

"am i getting huffy? no. if you'd keep up with the thread you'd understand my point.it's pretty disconcerting to see people walk in here, conveniently ignore 99% of the facts, and then present misinformation or off-topic opinions as facts.(none of this is directed at you, by the way.)seriously though, it's almost laughable that people could read all the information presented here and then draw the conclusion that nighthawk pilots should be singled out as the only group of (field) command ship pilots that need to use some variety of powergrid modules, rigs, or implants in order to make up for the massive shortage of powergrid with which the nighthawk has been burdened.let's take these two options - what makes more sense?a. nighthawk pilots should use a combination of several powergrid fitting mods, rigs, and implants in order to fit what other command ship pilots can fit with none.- or -b. the nighthawk needs a powergrid increase.after looking at the facts making one of the above two choices is essentially a no-brainer."
"at the stupid arguments in here. saying it losses pg from a drake when it isn't even designed from a drake but a ferox.thing is if you take all the tier 1 bc's you'll find they're pretty poor compared to the tier 2's, so of course comparing the tier 1 based commandships to the tier 2 bc's will look daft.oh and when comparing your passive setups remember to mention the recharge of the nh, it passive tanks what a abso would need a mar to rep.not saying nh doesn't need anything, just laughing at some of the extreme arguements being used and dodgy setups. hint: if you want more diversity don't try and force ships into practically same setups then whine when they don't fit."
"oh wow, how could we have missed this? ok, let's see now: ferox 1000 mw, nighthawk 710 pg. so we now need 290 pg for balance. nice one, einstein. the drake - nh comparison is perfectly valid because both are missile spammers with similar pg requirements. even the bloody onyx, with one launcher less and no gang mod to fit, has more pg than the nighthawk - 710 vs. 835!this is not true. firstly, peak regen only occurs at ~30% shield, so would only be equivalent to a mar across a very brief range. secondly, it's not true anyway. dual mar abso tanks, with one mar active, around 300 dps, depending on fit. peak passive regen on a buffer nh is around 200 dps. the abso is 50% better, even if the nh could somehow be perpetually held at peak regen, which it can't.now, what were you saying about dodgy arguments?"
"i was going to respond to this inane post, but gypsio already pwned you.edit - i will address the following ridiculous comment though, as several people have been dense enough to make it.how many people are truly stupid enough to believe that a ship not being able to fit what it is intended to fit creates 'diversity'? how about we tell the devs not to bother tweaking any ships for fitting ever again because they'll ruin the 'diversity'. in fact, let's just double the grid on tachyons to really add some 'diversity' to the game."

"in order to cut down on the spam in this forum, both for and against ideas by people voting with all the alts on their accounts i propose the following changes.1. each account holder delegates one of their characters on that account to hold the vote for that account. this choice cannot be changed once made.2. only those characters marked as holding a vote can post in this forum.3. (optional) you may delegate your vote from your alt account to your main account. this means that none of the characters on your alt account may post in this forum, however your main account voter will be able to cast the delegated votes. this would be represented in the corp ticker although unlike the ticker this cannot be turned off.you may recover your alt account's vote at any time reducing the votes of the main on any issue he's voted for.so, for example a persons ticker will end up looking like thisrandomvoter1(represents 3 accounts)racecorporationalliancethis could also be used as part of the voting process for the csm itself thus boosting turnout as it'll make it easier to cast all of your available votes rather than having to log in each account to vote individually.so, what do you guys think? good idea or back to the drawing board?"

"i dont really care one way or the other but a simple way to implement this would be that only the character with the most sp on any given account can votebut that would also require ccp to make votes private in some capacity - that is to not require a post for affirmative or negative"
"verry good idea. yes alts should be allowed to post in other forums. but this one should be main only. one person one vote."
"i agree that there should only be one support vote per account.what you are asking for here is a way to link your accounts together. this is a great idea and maybe ccp would consider the possibility of working multiple accounts directly into their business plan and pricing, giving a discount on the second and any subsequent accounts.you would then select the \"primary\" account and a \"main\" character (from that account) and that would be your forum posting character which would reflect the support of your accounts as you have outlined. posting with any other character from your accounts could see them with an \"alt\" tag just like your proposed representation tag and could be easily restricted from posting on caod and the like.if for any reason (and i'm sure there could be many), you decide to change your main character, that could be worked into the \"paid changes\" that are already offered, with a small charge attached, like the current ability to change your portrait."

"here is a list of things i'd like to see to give eve's universe a better immersion factor. many of them don't really change anything in eve to cause serious problems and most of them are simple tweaks or additions.1. allow players to \"rent\" billboards for a period of time allowing them to put up advertisements for various goods and services or corporation recruitment. a - option of having ad appear in missions that already have billboards in it. wrecked or otherwise.2. comets flying past in the background3. more detail in the planets. (do they even rotate?) a - home planets which can sustain life have discernible land masses and lights (from cities). b - planets have rings? c - massive clouds in the backdrop move about4. more activity in stations - ships landing on other pads, observe ships departing, being repaired, etc.5. when firing ship guns, empty shells are dispensed (except for laser guns anyway)6. when mining, asteroids change physically when mined continuously. chunks fly off, holes appear, char marks etc.7. as your ship sustains damage, noticeable aesthetic damage begins to appear; charred marks on the hull, engines flickering, armor plates fly off, electrical sparks. fuel leaks? rounds impacting on ships create little explosions and ship chunks(if shields are lost) fly off. repaired ships would lose this aesthetic degradation of quality.8. objects abandoned in the emptiness of space accrue damage over time and require repairs (hit by asteroids or simply decay). ships inside pos shields would obviously be immune to this.9. more activity at stargates. fast moving npc ships, haulers, civilian vehicles and transport ships. perhaps they have logos for companies on them such as quafe? military logos for military logistic services. haven't decided if they can be attacked.10. when attacked, neutral npc vehicles (such as haulers) have a small chance of paying a small ransom or drop a small amount of their haul to save themselves from being destroyed.11. space particles, small asteroids flying through, old or wrecked destroyed ships in the background.12. more activity observed outside the space stations. depending on station owner, military vehicles fly in and out. support ships fly to military ships or concord vessels to refuel them, maintenance crews fly to the sentry guns to repair them (they don't actually get damaged).13. missiles launched at targets out of range dud and burn out, harmlessly flying past the ship or bouncing off it.14. nebulae?15. when ships blow up, they have different animations when this event happens. some break in half, others just blow up in a million pieces.16. verbal warnings defined by the player to alert you when; your shields are low, your armor is sustaining heavy damage, you are in structure, warp scrammed, fired upon, etc. 17. more notification when you are being locked by another player. perhaps a larger target symbol in the overview or verbal notification such as \"an enemy player is attempting to lock onto you.\" only issue i see is if multiple enemies lock you and your ears might explode.that's all i have right now, i'll add more ideas as i get them."
"voting for myself"
"extremely good stuff!!eve needs a lot more immersion."
"overall, i like the gist of this a lot! i have some qualms with specific suggestions, but it would be great for ccp to take a look at this as part of the ongoing graphical update that they started with trinity. i do think that this is lower priority than game mechanics issues, though."
"that's okay, merely considering these ideas is enough for me. thanks for the support guys."
"some good ideas here - some of the aesthetic things here would need to be on a low-priority load into the graphics card buffer (or wherever stores the textures, i con't claim to be technical) so as to avoid lag."
"i like the idea in general. many of the ideas seem to be extra strains on the servers than anything else, but if ccp can find a way to implement them without it being an issue, then i'm all for it. i think number 17 is a bit excessive; i think the current system is fine and an audible warning could be extremely annoying. add to this the ability give your ship a custom paint job (i know it's been debated to hell) and this would be awesome."

"i don't worry that this could get overpowered: exchanging high slots (weapons) for drone power is not out of line (make them consume turret/launcher hardpoints if you worry too much). also, dont forget that there is still a hard limit on 5 drones to control, so a domi wont be spitting out 10 heavies even if it had enough bandwidth to do so. drone love will help pve more than pvp anyway. supported because drones need love!"

"shakari, sorry, didn't see it earlier! this is a great idea; it nicely circumvents a lot of the procedural nonsense we're dealing with now, and could very equitably automate some of the powers of the chairperson.some functionality it will need:1. thumbs-down and neutral (i.e., abstain) in addition to thumbs-up.2. threads automatically lock when enough csm delegates have voted on them for the outcome to be certain. this cuts off debate objectively. ccp folks can still post after a thread has been locked, to report on their eventual reaction to issues that made it to them.3. the chairperson's ability to move topics up and down would affect the order in which all delegates must vote on issues - a delegate would not be able to vote (although s/he would be able to comment) on topic #2 until s/he had voted on topic #1. this way, delegates can't avoid touchy issues that are brought before them, and delegates can vote at their own pace (be it go straight down the whole list all at once and not need to sit frustrated for 4 hours if they've already made up their mind, or take as much time as they like).4. the default on each thread would be that voting is off - comments only, no votes. only the chairperson or the poster would be able to turn voting on the topic on, so that (for example) more info can be presented if other csm members want more information before voting on it. it would be up to the poster or the chair to determine that enough information had been presented to allow voting to begin. once voting has been turned on for a particular topic, it cannot be turned off."
"is a nice idea, but given ccp's speed at addressing changes on behalf of the csm's operations, i can't see it happening soon.also, lack of enthusiasm may be from the perception of 'oh no, another thread complaining about the csm delegates/procedures' ... i know i'm tired of seeing them, and it's what almost made me not even click into this thread. however, since i did, signed ;)"
"/signed"
"how about make them 20km full damage area of effect, with a 5km damage falloff (half damage at 25km, no damage past 30km) but only go straight to where the target was at when you launched it, and will unconditionally explode upon reaching that point (think timed explosive projectile). and have damage not be affected by sig radius or velocity. this would be counterbalanced by having it reasonably slow moving, such that frigates that are awake have a chance of warping out, or even failing that, fast frigates can be outside the radius anyways by the time it blows up. also make it so it cannot be fired on targets closer than 15km away, to give said fast ships a chance to react.one reasoning for not being affected by sig radius, is that while regular large missiles can have a \"near miss\" when tracking small targets, thus doing less damage, bombs have such large explosions that it won't really matter if it \"near misses\" you. the game mechanic reason would be that we've already demonstrated that bombs affected by sig radius are rather gimp.. the reason for the sig radius and velocity effects on missile damage seem to be for approximating/simplifying explosion mechanics when they are relatively too small to provide appreciable interactivity/fun. which won't be the case for bombs anyway.. they make big booms :)"
"bombs are perfect as they are here is how to use them. wait on a gate for enemy blob to come thru 20km away facing directly towards the gate and fully stop. then when the blob comes, unclock, launch bomb, wait 2 seconds, recloak\" profit i've killed 100mil in frigs, interceptors, with a 6mil bomb with this tactic.bombs are anti-blob, that\"s it!!"

"train some damn skills, a geddon will fit 7 tachs and a mwd with 2 x rcu ii and an apoc will fit 8 + mwd with the same.amarrian snipers are (and always have been) the best by far (look at any sniper killmail, your geddons and apocs will likely be close to the top of the mail) if you can get by the cap issue, the fitting issues are there to stop them becoming too powerful."
"what a poor flame.i already said you need 2 rcu for 8 tach apoc. armageddon + 7 tach ii + 100mn mwd ii requires 3 fitting mods. go try it yourself before you claim you \"know it all\".most killboards show megathrons on killmails, but having killmails baised on game balance is rather silly.back to point, you are saying that just because you see a amarr ship in a killmail, it is the acceptable reason for a megathron to have tons of grid to fit? dude, you are aware that amarr had no issue till ccp nerfed teh grid to stop other races using lasers right?"
"why do you feel the need to put a tech 2 mwd on a sniper? that's not smart. use tech 1/named. then it fits with 2 rcu 2s."
"when your tachyons do the same damage / alpha as 425mm railguns, then it is fair to balance the two based on fittings.whatever, this is such a ******ed proposal theres no point me even replying, people have been whinging about the fittings of tachyons for years - nothing has been done about it, apocs and geddons still regularly shine in sniper fleets, and yet people still feel the need to whinge about it. if you want better fittings, then maybe tachyon alpha / damage should be reduced to be inline with the other guns and then you can have your lower pg use, ok?"

"i like the idea of a skill needing to be trained, but all in all this is a great idea."
"totally agree on this idea of learning a skill to lower the time it takes to jc"
"an extra aproove for scapa and dagas who forgot to check the support box, and regarding the potential requirement of a skill, we maybe can have one that reduces the time by 10% per level (so at level 5 you would wait 12h per jump)or no skill at all, all up to ccp how they decide would be a better solution and up to the game mechanics possibility."
"i think a skill is a great idea, starting at 12 hours and knocking off an hour per skill level would be good enough for me."
"the problem for alot of peopel is limited playtime, eg. since the limit is 24hrs it becomes slightly later on the day eveyr time if you want to do it a few times in a row so you eventually have to skip a day. a skill that would take off 5% of the 24hrs per level would be enough to fix this."
"thought there was already a thread about this, buyt definately gets my support."

"this idea would motivate a lot of players to start messing around in low-sec as well. players don't want to risk their 200mill of implants or what not and they also don't want to jump into their clone and lose the benefits from the attribute boost. especially if they cant get on the next day, etc. i know i can't get on all the time and i hate having a skill take 12hours longer to train because i cant jump back to that clone. the skill training idea is good but i would lower the timer down to 6 hours and perhaps make the jump clones cost way way more to even it out. its not a huge issue but meh.my 2 cents. *shrugs*"
"yes, please"
"hell yes"
"yesssss. can my rokh have more pointy sticks btw?"
"make it happen"
"i can't believe all these people are treating this council like some sort of game. this is totally inappropriate.another reason all goons should be banned."
"this is just one reason why i cannot support any members of the something awful forums from congregating in this game. it produces absurd ideas like the original idea proposed in the first post. not only such, but it begs to be taken seriously, in a forum and place in which it cannot be.go ahead and vote goonswarm and friends, it won't matter in the end. all you will do is raise issues which ultmately will push ccp to taking action against your members as a whole (at least in my opinion)."
"in my opinion you are a mentally challenged petty person who doesn't realize that \"goons\" mess with you but many know this game better than you and want it to change for the better. their is no reason that titans are not monster trucks the empires can do what ever they feel like and that would just be cool. you on the other hand just see goons like a tool and assume every thing we say is bad. do you think we should change capital ships online like bane is? do you think we should not make matar cap ships better like yorda? what about large auto cannons banes other topic? we love you troll but you really are stupid."
"yes, yes i do. but then again, look at some of the things that goonswarm members have done in the past. look at the immature members they contain. now look at it outside the box, and tell me that people outside your little area don't see goonswarm, and this thread by extension, as a drain on resources within the game, while trying to ruin eve online by conforming it to their own ideal, while telling outsiders, basically, \"to heck with you\".there is nothing wrong with having fun in the game, i'll grant ya that. but the sheer irresponsibility with which goonswarm members hold themselves to, especially in this part of the forums, is appalling to say the least."
"i don't think people should care about being responsible it is a game for god sake. people do what they do to have fun. have you suicided ships for the fun of it? riding bikes is to be expected after the massive about of bull we have dealt with. have you ever seen a non-npc titan? have you had to deal with fleet fights where you know in anything less than a cap ship you are useless because your enemies can doomsday you ever 10 mins? did people in your corp make eve-mon because they wanted to help friends? did your corp start a wiki to help all your new player and get thousands of new players out into 0.0 space? really were you station camped into syndicate by bob when your entire alliance had less than 5 cap ships, and told you would never be able to live in 0.0 space again? people have taken a dump on us for years and we fight back, grow stronger, grow larger because people like you. hell bane wrote the titan manifesto that got things changed."
"postin' in an irresponsible thread"
"if each racial titan is a different truck then yes."
"defo, if there's kittens."
"yes i have. i've also suicided out of boredom, stupidity, and because i follow my fc's orders to a t, even when i shouldn't have. i wasn't aware that only people who have see titans were the only people qualified to vote on this issue, but thank you for letting me know that something i might see/do in the future is something i cannot vote on now; you may as well take your own advice when voting on issues too in the future.yes, i have been involved in fleet battles where one might expect only some of the capital ships to get out safely, and if any non-capitals came back, it was because de-sync had kept them from joining the fight.so what i read here is that i must have been in a corporation of thousands, many with attention problems, in order to be taken seriously by you. i would never be in a corporation that recruited new players by the hundreds. i would sooner leave, and then to take them to 0.0 space... well, ask outsiders what they see gs as. they are disconnected from the main of eve, and always have been largely. that is why it is was nearly required of your older members to create evemon and a wiki- you had too many new players lost in eve, with too few people to show them how to play properly.in contrast, most pvp corporations recruit people either based on skillpoints, or may choose to let such slide when talking to an extraordinary person with as much focus, determination, and maturity, that their sp isn't a true reflection of how they grasp the game. needless to say, this wasn't how gs gained so many members early on, recruiting from the get go from the something awful forums as one of the first requirements. i am not aware there was any sp limit, or any in-game requirements for that matter, and as time has gone on and members have left, i am sure many other requirements have been lowered simply to keep active member count up.in short, those looking in will see what i see in the end. while there are a number of players who are good at the game, are mature, or show some responsibility or tact at the least, many of your players will always be viewed as being immature children who want only their way, and will go to any means to accomplish such- and the proof positive is here in the csm forums as a final nail in the lid."
"i didn't read this but your posting sure seems to be... something awfulxd"
"i know, a wall of text. sorry, but i do expect to defend myself when someone tries to belittle me, my opinion, or my friends.that said, i can understand why you didn't read it. normally, i would disregard such a long post myself."
"i really dont think you read his post your doesn't even seem to be responding to what he said."
"no, i have. he's said he didn't read it, but references it anyhow. so, what was your point again?"
"i mean your stupid long wordy post i tried to read it but its like your not even responding to the post your quoting."
"could you clear that up a bit, make it more legible? i cannot tell if you are talking as if you were the mapmaker (that is, explaining what it is he said/meant to say), or if you are saying that four lines is a long post.if you're talking about my response to fallorn, i fail to see how i was not responding to his post. if you could give me examples, i would most appreciative to understand where you are coming from there."
"this thread reminds me of my army days when i used to spend time practicing in the tank combat simulators in korea. those things broke down and had bugs all the time. one bug in particular made the enemy fire humvee's at us instead of tank rounds. so there were humvee's buzzing all around the screen like flies. it was a fun day."
"oh yeah"
"what kind of action"
"i hope it's girl on girl action, that's my favourite."
"my. god. i thought this was the eve forum. i suppose i suddenly stumbled into the wow forums instead. seriously people: eve is supposed to have a more mature player base than any other mmo out there; why are you working so hard to prove this wrong?"
"i could only imagine bannings, temporary or permanent (though i doubt many, if any, goons members actually get to this point really); either forum or account. i couldn't really guess accurately, as i'm a player, not an employee of ccp. instances of eula violation, spamming, harassment, and of course racial/sexual slurs as well as some other things i cannot now think of could bring it about.of course, that's how i see it, and doubtless those people in positions to do anything would take everything into account, and disregard the goon ticker. i would hope they would at least."
"are you imagining offenses for which you had previously stated there should be punishment? either goons should be punished for something or they shouldn't. saying \"goons should be banned imo\" then \"i don't know what they've done\" when asked why is pretty silly.also i support this idea. ++"
"has to happen or everyone will emoragequit"
"i never stated, to my knowledge, that any member should be punished retroactively; in addition, if i had knowledge of rules being broken, i would take my concerns to the proper channels of ccp. i also never said goons should be banned, nor was asked directly why i think they should be (and i never said they should be). i implied that they are viewed as a whole, and act immaturely, and may be dealt with as a group for such a reason, yes; and that is pure speculation on my part, i admit. but if the past serves as an indicator of future behavior, then future outrages would tend to be supported by many other members of goonswarm, would you not concur?or, to put it another way; if, for instance, bob was found to have done something to cause ire to somebody, and it caused a drama, would you not expect bob to coalesce as a group and either support or kick members involved? if over time, such instances were occuring often enough, where would one draw the line at practices that disrupt business flow? that is where i am getting at- that goonswarm, though inventive as a group, will eventually overstep their boundaries in attempting to ruin enough of other players gameplay, that ccp may be forced to take action against a group of players with a strong common bond, rather than individually and over time (which could cause more drama and more damage)."

"i find it very troubling that the head of the organization designed to bring player concerns to ccp cannot seem to communicate in a manner that does not involve a giant wall of text. clear and concise communication is not too much to expect from someone in such a position.therefore i propose a 50 word limit on any response or proposal jade constantine gives on a particular subject be it to members of the community, csm members, or ccp."
"how about i give you the finger...and you give me my 4000 characters?</neo>"
"how many post has jade written today on the combined forums he visits and how many characters has he used? i'm going to guess well over 100k that is in one day no one should have to read through his wall of text that say nothing."
"i guess i support this. as you can see i have the required thumbs up"
"amazingly enough, i think you've gotten your wish - nobody does have to read it. i'd be hard-pressed to think of a more pathetic request than someone sitting in an internet forum complaining about there being too many words. if you don't like it this way, 4chan isn't exactly hard to find."
"clearly you have misread my post kind sir. my concern is that the chair of the csm and ultimately our voice cannot make to the point statements on seemingly anything. he will have to communicate things to ccp. ccp being made up of various producers, programmers, qa staff of course cannot be required to read 500 words when 50 will do just fine."
"/me adds his signature, and why not?it could only benefit the head-chair-person-thingie-whatever-you-wish-to-call-them, that they have one duty, and one only- to keep things in order. doing so shouldn't require a huge wall of text that makes everybody groan to see. this would enforce that as a reminder that this is their duty, in a continuous manner."
"the total absurdity of this suggestion should tell you everything about this \"issue\" and its supporters."
"i just hit random for my character."
"so you seem to think that you are being forced to read all that text?. i am sure if he just gave bullet points that you would complain that he was not being descriptive enough.the real issue is you."
"not really bullet points work for me."
"they have implants to fix that you know.now if you can come up with an actual reason other than your own laziness for why you should be accommodated please do."
"any chance we can get a moratorium on moronic, time-wasting, so-called \"issues\" like this?didn't think so.oh well, i guess it's too much to expect the vaunted maturity of the eve playerbase to spend it's time on issues that actually matter. i thought the petty wow-like squabbling was supposed to be beneath us."
"how about instead of one player having a word limit we think about this issue from a different direction and look at maybe having a post limit of 100 posts from each alliance per day on jita park and assembly hall?"
"unfortunately such a rule would be exploited by those dishonorable people willing to corp hop in order to post! further, my proposal would force the chair to \"tl;dr\" as it were, not so that i don't have to read it, but so that the poor souls at ccp are not forced to endure such vicious onslaughts of verbal and text based diarrhea. my point is that walls of text are in no way helpful in the real world, nor do professionals communicate in this manner. if we the people of this game and this psuedo-government are to have any success we need to ensure that the chairman is able to communicate in a professional and realistic manner.thank you for your time.sincerly,cap iihonourable space captaingoonfleetgoonswarm"
"i think we could make a fair compromise by making that post limit into a character limit. each alliance would have a maximum amount of characters they could use in any one posting day here. maybe we should have it scale to the size of an alliance?"
"a fair system would probably be to base it on alliance size. i'll never understand why you seem so surprised that a 5,100 person alliance posts more than your 164 person alliance."
"bad idea, we'd never hear anything from anyone else in jade's alliance"
"no support.the op couldn't even frame his ridiculous proposal in 50 words or less."
"and an eight word limit to any response! ak"
"you guys need to realise that the csm is all about the comedy.jade's role as bat**** insane chairman is an essential part of the show."
"simple way would be to just ask the likes of the csm council to, reply to topics in a clear and precise mannor without adding a load of bull****. the last thing we need is walls of text when the same post could be made in one paragraph making it easy and a pleasure to read."
"you see that? yeah, that's the moral high ground, disappearing into the distance behind you."
"post 1: 51+ words, somehow not clearly communicating the point, why else write:post 6: 51+ words, somehow not clearly communicating the point, why else write:post 15: 100+ words. to be continued...?clearly it is impossible to clearly communicate certain things in 50 words.but my main point is that this kind of 'advise' should be given directly to the person in question. this is hardly an 'issue' for the csm."
"i can only assume you're making a bad joke. jade may not be concise, but at least he's thorough; there isn't really any way to misinterpret his posts. if a topic requires a less-than-fifty-word response, it probably isn't worth debating, is it?also, these are issues we're supposed to be \"voting on\" so that they can be taken to ccp; why the hell would this ever make it out of the assembly hall?"
"once again the easiest way to fix this issue is to make a very hard way of getting new ones into the game. i admit there would still be poeple crying that its to hard. but it should be an option."
"and do you know why the t2 market crashed? because it went from an oligopoly to something a lot closer to an open market. however, there is still one significant barrier separating the t2 bpc inventors from the t2 bpo holders, and that is the cost/risk aspect of invention.a bpo is pretty much guaranteed to have a better me than any invention bpc, in fact i don't think it's possible to have a worse one. and since most bpcs from invention have negative me's, that means that at the very least, the bpc inventor already has a 10% higher base cost to their production. add in the 'every attempt is a success' unrealistic cost of invention with datacores, t1 bpcs, and time, and you have an even higher cost overhead for the inventor. tack on the possibility of that t2 bpo being researched to me 10 and it gets even worse.the production cost differences are staggering. sure there are t2 items where there is no t1 equivalent, but they're not nearly as popular.it's why most t2 frigate invention is pretty much a guaranteed lost because of the non-scaling cost of decryptors and the base construction costs.crunching the numbers on production costs was impressive and eye-opening to say the least.turning the existing bpo's into max-run bpc's would be too harsh, but give them a limit. maybe 100 runs or something, but they're still relics of a darker time for eve's economy."
"bra'nn does raise one good point here, and that's the non-scaling cost of decryptors. i would endorse a plan to make invention take as many decryptors as datacores in order to get decryption bonuses, assuming that drop rates and current stack sizes were increased accordingly(say, x16 or so?)."
"seems everyone's prepared to whine about the situation that dev's created and constantly critisize their game design. nobody gives any thought for the players that continue to save their iskies and buy bpos. (the option thats allways been there, but sure, whine becuase thats somehow 'unfair')is the last official comment from fanfest '07 of 'no change for t2 bpos' still valid, or will people that continue to invest 10's of bil in t2 bpos be screwed over by stealth nurf?"
"using your example, serious producer building only vagabonds:bpo holder can produce 18 vagabonds from invented bpc in x time, plus 3 from bpo (lower production time, let's give him a greter bonus than real). so 21 vagabonds.they sell at 100 each, gain from bpc 10, from bpo 20. total gain 240.equivalent producer, using only invnetion. 20 vagabonds, netting 10 each. his return 200.the inestment of the first players is something like 40 billions, the investmen of the second player is about 1 billion. so who is getting the better return from the investment?part ii. selling 20 vagabond each they have crashed the market, now the vagabond sell at 85. they switch invention to another item that cost 90 to invent and sell at 100.inventor still get 200 from his inventions. the bpo holder can choose to use the bpo and get 180 from invention and 15 from the bpo for 195 total (less than a pure inventor) or can stop producing from the bpo and do only invention for 200, but then he has unused a 40 billion asset."
"notice the bolded part of your citation? invention is exactly the duplicating an imitating procedure they cite.because people like you and your friends see \"tii\" and stop thinking, not doing the math of the returns and because there is people with a lot of isk and little avenue of investment. when and if you have 50-100 billions in the wallet and not the time to run after good investments in all eve a 1% return from something that require relatively little work can seem worthwhile."
"this.although i am sure reason goes out the window when ppl think that others can make a little more than they can, but the fact is that it is not true."
"the t2 market is know a dual market. invention and t2 bpo's. in the time there were only t2 ship/mods prices exploded. if you remove the t2 bpo's there won't be a steady suply of all kind of t2 goods and the market's will get cleaned out(market manipulation) witch will result in verry high prices (the pvp guy's wine, a lot louder than than the people on this post).we now have a stable t2 market, witch is good for pvp and that is what ccp wants. loosing a t2 ship in pvp combat is not so expensive. if t2 come's from 1 sourge i will be and t2 ships will only be used in mission play.the t2 bpo holders have a adv over invention since they can make it cheaper, however they have only one bpo(one factorie) and can not switch if the product they produce is no longer hot on the market, inventors can.adding new t2 bpo's will make invention useless, and degrade's t2 building to t1 building."
"why the hell are you all talking about market and profit?for me its simple. i have a corp and t2 bpo owner has one. both have same number of chars in corp. who needs to spend more time to produce t2 ships for number of corpmates?and thats all. time for copying + time of invention + more minerals means that invention looses.solution (apply one or both):1. change t2 bpos to max run bpcs 2. let me/pe level of t1 bpc influence the outcome of invention (me/pe of t2 bpc)just to get everyone a fair chance and some competition fun. for now new players search for old corp to be sure they will get t2 stuff when its needed for a reasonable price. its also part of the problems with blobs if you ask me. large gatherings around established/avaliable resources -> for example gallery of t2 bpos most of old alliances/players haveedit for supportedit 2 to clear the wall of text a bit"
"did you factor in the multi billion cost for the bpo and at a margin of a mil or so per item extra profit for using it, you need to build 2-4 thousand ships before you see any return above that of a inventor."
"ubpc weren't nurfed into max run bpc, but bpc with massive amount of runs. why would t2 bp be nurfed to max runs?the real issue that needs to be raised with the devs by the csm is the continuing investment of 10's of bil for bpos, after the '07 fanfest q&a response of 'no t2 change planned'"
"you are 100% correct joe - and that is why i have created this thread: t2 bpo future - request for a comprehensive dev bloglinking it here for a second time, because i want all the whiners to actually show some backbone and ask a question, rather than spout garbage. of course, all those in favor of bpos staying the way they are should also be legitimately interested in the answers as well."
"i love people who assume that bpos have 0 cost to acquire for the current owners. especially when they then go on about the costs of datacores and decryptors. even more so when they whine about how they can't acquire them in the same post!i do have to wonder how many bpos are with their original owners. the sell orders forum would have me believe its not a large number.however, topics like this make me want something stronger than simply not supporting it, i want a thumbs down."
"it's hilarious people trying to justify t2 bpos to stay in the game with some sort of i paid x number of isk for something as if it means anything at all. please, really you make me laugh.when items can no longer be acquired by anyone in game they should no longer exist in game. this is pretty standard game design stuff which ccp and some people here can't get their head around."
"you're absolutely right, you can't buy t2 bpos at all. ever. they're never sold. especially since (insert large alliance here) has them all."
"the mechanism for releasing t2 bpos into the game is gone. unless they reinstated the lottery when i wasn't looking."
"oh, i see now. because the lottery is gone, you can't get them without working for it anymore. :shobon:"
"because the lottery is gone there is no way to get one that doesn't involve bending over."
"do you mean paying for them?.would you buy a bpo for 40ish bil when all it would save you is 1-4 mil per ship it builds?. considering you can put out a almost unlimited number with invention it is not worth it tbh.the only reason i can see that ppl want bpo's removed is sour grapes cos realistically they are losing nothing by not owning one and buying one is not financially worth it. so we are left with the bitter morons crying about not owning or being able to afford one when they are sold."
"you just illustrated perfectly why t2 bpos aren't realistically acquirable for profit making and leaving them in the game only benefits the old time gamers."
"i also pointed out that they are of no real benefit to anybody but i see you chose to snip that bit and the reason why ppl like you still want them removed. (re-added)"
"they benefit those who got them originally since they didn't have the up-front cost. also since the me/pe is still better than any invention they still print isk. i would accept a change for t2 bpos to make them have worse me/pe than invention instead of removing them from the game. that seems pretty reasonable. you get the benefit of infinite runs without having the randomness of invention."
"negative ppl like you make me sick, you are so full of venom and jealousy that all you can think of is taking from others.why not petition for increasing the me/pe in invention bpc's instead of thinking like a whiney child and thinking nerf nerf nerf.did you read post 80 btw, you realy should."
"let me restate the same thing in a different way. change the balance of pe/me to make invention more profitable than a t2 bpo for a given item. i don't care how it's done. nerf or buff it really makes no difference to me. apparently people have severe allergic reactions to the word nerf even though buffing a different item has the same effect.yes you can switch easier what you are producing with invention. i thought that much was obvious. however, nothing is keeping the bpo holder using invention as well to suppliment the bpo income."
"supplement?.how does the fact that you can build 100 ships from invention with enough building slots but only 1 from the bpo make invention the \"supplemental\" item ffs. the bpo makes a few mil isk per item more than each individual invention bpc but you can have 100's of invention bpc running at the same time as your single bpo."
"since faction warfare is geared towards newer players and corps i decided to make a new 800k alt and give it a go, i ran about 20 missions for minmatar and did a storyline mission, final standings 0.06.. so you telling me before i can play fw i need to run about 200 missions? or get a bunch of social skills?remove the standings, period. let the new players play."
"if you do the intro missions for your own faction that will suffice. if you want to take part in a faction other than the one you were born to, it would seem so."
"well, you need unmodified standings to participate...so social skills would only help you in getting there faster...and 0.5 is really low, i was expecting something like 2.0..."
"i'd like to propose a vote to stop goons turning these issue's into threadnaughts and have a policy in place that only allows certain individuals from corps/alliances to post e.g. director's/ceo's. (might be an idea for caod too)."
"can i have your ceo's contact details plz?"
"not supported.if you restrict posting rights in such a way then you also stifle legitimate debate on these issues. for example, by doing this you automatically lock out all the players in npc corporations as none of them can become directors/ceos"
"last time i checked, goons were all paying for their subscriptions and don't deserve this type of discrimination. your suggestion is also flawed since it doesn't take corp size and possible internal conflict into consideration. csm is about vox populi and i hope their aim is not to turn this into an oligarchy, so we'll have to suffer the goons' and everyone else's post bombardments.greetings,grismar (who feels his choice for the strongly liberal and democratic gallente is finally working out well, nevermind the gallente elections ;))"
"oh noes you sunk mah battleship"
"well ill admit the goon allience and corp do seem full of forum children. but i cant say it should prvent them from posting on issues. one player one vote sort of a thing. now if they cant conduct them selves in a aporpriate manner. then there mods for that. so this thread is rite up there with usless spam in a forum meant to be used for game issues we want the csm to take on."
"no they don't, people just say they do."
"no ive seen alot of there posts. they do have them. a but again it should have no bearing in the fact there players too. and they should have a say. they should just realize that when they try to hijack or post stupid comments it hurts there cause is all. edit> i also wanted to say not all of them. and ive seen many other allience with the same sort of children. but were discussing goonswarm."
"what about 1 man alt corps? they would be ceo and thats how they post on coad at the moment!"
"csm is supposed to be voice of the players and you want to exclude 90% of people from posting? dumbest idea i ever heard.no."
"goonies are not human beings therefore their opinion is null and they need to be banned from the forums and probably the game too.in conclusion please gtfo goonies."
"no support i'm afraid. i don't like the gs threadnaughts either, but every goonswarm player is an individual, too, and they're each entitled to their opinions just like the rest of us."
"if, god forbid, i ever do join the goons, it'll be just to see people like you cry."
"what about well known forum trolls?"
"that's why most of us joined in the first place.i haven't seen anything even remotely resembling a threadnaught so i really don't know what your talking about."
"that's because there hasn't been one. people simply can't comprehend that in a group of 5000 or so people some of them may all post and some may even have similar opinions.\"threadnaught\" has been the latest term used to describe \"posting on a forum on the internet by goons\". it's really quite stupid."
"being the biggest alliance in eve and having a higher percentage of our playerbase taking part in the csm process does not equal \"threadnaughts\". which threads are you referring to anyway?"
"not supported, i'd much rather see people who don't know how to spell or even use a simple spell checker be blocked from posting."
"noes."
"and deprive the eve community of such intriguing entertainment? i think not!"
"do you know what a \"threadnaught\" is?no."
"i propose that the op be flogged with a poisonous snake."
"never stop posting dont stop posting dont ever stop posting"
"actually, threadnaught was first used about a year ago as a description for a famed instance in which gf actively spammed a few threads with the express purpose of suppressing discussion with sheer weight of numbers.i would suggest you research the history of the game you were elected to steer before pointing your finger and calling people stupid.personally i would call threadnaught when the posts don't actually help with sensible debate...oh look an example..."
"/signed"
"i know what the term means. we coined it. when the threadnaught was unleashed we specifically called it that. it was used once.perhaps you should do some more research on the topics you're discussing before you start suggesting others should. it's not my problem if you don't understand a term and use it incorrectly."
"posting in a goonswarm moral blog."
"sigh, contradicted yourself in your own posts there.andyou can't have both mutually exclusive descriptions and choose which ever suits your argument at the time.lets set some definitions.threadnaught - we will go with your second definition, the one where you said it was used once.so what shall we use for everything else where we have posts that seem to have little purpose other than to obfuscate, belittle, dilute and even sidetrack an issue or entire forum. i suggest we call this trolling. just to make it easier for us all.one issue remains, what should we call someone who seems to have been elected to champion the trolling masses? i think historically it's called agent provocateur?"
"the implied part of the first definition would be \"since the first one.\" i.e: that's because there hasn't been one since the first one.you probably would've realized that if you weren't too busy trying to make goons look bad in an attempt to recover jade's e-honor."
"i didn't contradict myself at all. let me clear it up for you cream puff. the threadnaught was used once. you have chosen to use the term to replace another term popularly known as \"posting\". this is a repeat of what i've already said.now you can quote this and say i'm saying something else entirely yet a third time, but i've been pretty clear. people are \"posting\". they are doing it of their own volition. if you don't like it leave the internet because it happens on every forum and i can't save you from yourself. i can guarantee you'll never find yourself in some perfect place where people only post things you like or find personally relevant unless it's a private forum inhabited only by yourself and those like you. this isn't it.do you get it yet?"
"ehh....no"
"they should be rounded up and put into camps as well."
"then take their cloths and the gold fillings from their teeth and make them take \"showers\" we see what type of person you are you ****** loving ****."
"makes sense to me. even if it only relieves congestion a little, every little bit helps."
"having a 'ring road' could make issues for autopilot settings - e.g. if it is set to 'prefer safer' - the option that many people flying through empire will be on - then the safety value of hopping around jita (itself a 0.9 system) would need to be higher than jita itself.this could perhaps be done more simply by having an option added to autopilot that could be checked or unchecked:avoid systems with more than 100 pilots.along with, of course, the other nice wannahave of autopilot:avoid systems where an enemy faction holds sovereignty (could also have nil sec useage possibly - i don't go nil sec so i can't speak on the mechanics of sovereignty there)"
"isn't the chokepoint one of the main reasons why jita is the tradehub?"
"maybe, maybe not...but its in place now, and people don't want to go through it. so an option to go around jita would be nice - even though i won't use it, as i use rens for all my trading needs."
"the title says it all.1 you have the dread which = pos killer2 you have the carrier which = uber logistics and ultra drone wielder3 you have the mom which is a beefed up version of the carrier4 you have the titan which can nuke 300 ships in 1 shot5 we dont have a fleet cap ship. something designed to take on fleet ships ie bs etc. im proposing that a capital ship be invented that is pure anti support support and anti fleet effective. something you can hot drop and people actually worry. what im thinking is something which is designed to follow a fleet and engage fleet ships and not capitals (have guns geared towards anti non capital ships).we have seen several new ships since 2003 yet theres little in the way of capital ships that are affordable to the average player other then a carrier or dread. at the moment capitals are over rated, expensive, not really effective and only serve as bullet magnets. we need a ship that is capable not invulnerable. ie a ship that can sit in a fleet of 100 and remove fleet ships (think of it as a dread variant) cos tbh ... caps are boring and seriously underused, we need to bring back the fun in cap ships and bring back their use"
"a) carriers/ms already do that.b) titans w/ carriers/ms already do that.c) last thing this game needs is more capitals."
"this is a bad idea because having a capital ship that can easily kill subcapitals (even more than carriers/motherships) will make subcaps totally useless as opposed to just mostly uselessthis game is already capital ships online to a high degree and it doesn't need to be made more so"
"fantastic idea. you could give it like 8 high slots fitted with high powered lasers capable of one shotting any sub-capital and it would have the lock time of a frigate. or a better idea would be to give it rapid fire doomsday that wouldn't hurt friendly ships or enemy capitals."
"i hate to agree with the two goons above me, but yeah they're basically right.titan dd is already anti support par excellence, and fighters from carriers/motherships are used to great effect against enemy bs fleets.actually there's more of a need of a conventional anti-capital ship beyond the bs, then for an additional capital ship that would even more unbalance 0.0 warfare in favor of capital ship usage."
"there are many people who have gone out of their way to help make ccp what it is. those who teach new players, help in events and basically have spent a lot of time making eve a better place for everyone.ccp can easily find out who the most influential in-game players are who have done so much to help the game and approach them to fill the role of csm.they have a track record of positive action toward the game as a whole.the current csm do not.the current csm should be disbanded and the institution should be put on hold until enough people who actually want to make eve a better place can be contacted and recruited for this task.thank you rells for the original idea.the only thing i would like to add is the position should be open to anyone with a reputation for helping eve and the general playerbase. not just organizations and their constituents. thank you."
"with the introduction of tier2 battle cruisers i expected ccp to change the command ship models to reflect the new additions, as it has not happened i propose that the field command ships take on the models of tier 2 battle cruisers cos tbh it would look nice (black drake omg!, sexy hurricane as sleipnir oooo) the changes i propose are as follows which are purely for asthetic reasons, no changes to slot/pg-cpu/bonuses etc neededsleipnir - to use hurricane modelnighthawk - to use drake modelabsolution - to use harbinger modelastarte - to use myrmidon model"
"what ya think?"
"little yellow thumbs up is what i thinkbut the bonuses + slot layouts might need to be changed as sleipner gets a shield boost bonus while the hurricane is more armour-oriented"
"sory to clarify, what i ment was no slot change to the current command ships, for example if a sleipnir can use 7 guns 4 mids 6 lows, then make the new model reflect that so the new sleipnir model slot layout would reflect the old slot layout if you get my meaning"

"how many of you log into eve just to chat with your corp, alliance, or \"girl\"friend you met in some shady gallente docking station? i think an out of game chat client would be a great way to keep in touch with what's going on in the game while i'm doing something else, and would use much less resources and screen space than keeping the client open."
"i like it, sometimes i just want to log in to talk with corp or alliance, and check mail."
"i like."
"i support this. also an out-of game eve voice client would be nice."
"good idea!a standalone client would be great, but i think a web interface, right on www.eve-online.com, would be even better (as gmail and facebook do, for example).there would have to be some way of marking in the in-game chat that you're not actually in your ship, though."
"its called jabber, irc, teamspeak, ventrilo.get your own servers, cheapskates."
"when soe had this working with eq2 it was great. i could chat to guildies while at work etc. it could also make it easier to attend in game meetings etc."
"maybe for a aditional fee. server loads im thinking is all. but it does sound good. btw if soe did it it must be good......lmao!"
"atleast eq2 runs without constant node crashes and horrible lag? that is something they are doing better then ccp."
"who says that everyone uses those? and why not have a single client that everyone uses, instead of scattering them cross the four you have listed?i would think it would be less of a load on the server, as you are only accessing the chat information, instead of everything that is used when i log into eve using the client."
"self explainitory. one for each side to help others with info. perhaps some strong moderation to weed the epeeen fluff and actually have it a useful info source."
"i went over this one a while back on eve general after the fw info came out - see this post and this post from this thread. it's way more ambitious than what they've actually done, but i think there are some good ideas there:"
"very good idea."
"industrials and specops would be a great addition. also war is war and it runs on industry. agree let the miners and industry have a place in the fight. system control no. but the price of factional items yes. gallen cant get the supplies in they dont get the shinny ships. and vise vesa."
"you know, you never received the majority of the vote. out of the nine csms, you only made about 19% of the vote. bane and darius together, for example, have more votes than you. if there are enough people in the playerbase or the council that feel strongly enough to rethink your position (which is what we're asking for), then anything else is less than democratic. do your job, and let the people be heard."
"this is a bit ot but where can i read these meetings at? i can't find any links to any of them."
"www.eve-csm.com - there's also chatlog links in the jita park threads of the completed meetings."

"to be honest, the argument to train all learning skills to 4/3 from the start is ******ed at best.i started by training the learning skills that directly effected my training time for my next ship/item - as given to me via evemon. learning skills are only a burden if people arn't smart about informing the newbs about them."
"i think fixing assault frigs could be done by.1: reduce sig radius. slightly lower than a frig but more than an inty2: increase speed. should have a base speed 20% faster than a regular frigate.3: increase warpspeed of intercepters and interdictors. this will maintain the interceptors role. subwarp speed of interceptors is fast enough, however i think haf should be able to break 3kmps without rigs or snakes. reduce the warp speed of all hac's and haf's4:"
"afaik, the hawk needs rethinking, it tanks better than its t1 counterpart, but the damage is nominal, the hawks total damage is lower than the kestrels. with the same fittings.personally i see something wrong with this. although it does shoot them a little further. which frankly, doesn't really matter very much. would have if the kestrel couldn't shoot out of webber range. but it can. and the range increase doesn't change it and make it \"available to avoid\" anything else."
"afs are inordinately slow for what they are. logic would put them somewhere between the speed of hacs and ceptors.if afs were actually there they'd be able to play a nice role in the nano game as something that can tackle a hac without getting insta-popped. however, i must say that i did kinda like my ishkur for the little while i had it. it might not have been that great at blowing stuff up, but the frig sig radius and sensor res do make it much better than a cruiser at picking fights. if an af meets a cruiser in passing, it's the af that gets to chose fight or flight at least.i guess maybe one train of thought is that they're already very good at tanking things like complexes and such, so maybe they're intended more as a pve ship?"
"slower and heavier frigates are called destroyers. a slow and heavy frigate is just gimp.fixing af's could be done by *gasp* actually making them handle like frigates instead of plated destroyers. the need the mass and speed of their t1 counterparts. this isn't asking for too much, given that heavy assault cruisers are lighter and faster than their counterparts. they also need their missing 4th bonus."
"it seems pretty frivolous to designate certain ships as pve or pvp. ideally, all ships should be useful in both."
"if you want this to be done properly then you need:- a clear agenda with all points of discussion prepared before hand and handed out to all members before the meeting- a chairman who is unbiased and good at time management, probably a ccp employeeas for the muting, well, i can understand the time constraints but seriously, if you're going to give someone moderation of a channel at least make sure they know how to moderate properly. the mute-kick bug has been there for months.it was pretty good comedy though, next time someone prepare highlights so i don't have to read all the drivel."
"(a) the thread you linked did not contain this discussion - in fact, the visible thread did not have any sort of massive support, indicating it's an issue you like rather then a popular issue.(b) your arguments are hugely flawed, given firepower has increased as well and player mechanics have been developed (bumping, the most popular solution to station hugging, particularly when you undock) to offset deaggro/dock/tank tactics (which are valid tactics btw). all sub bs ships right now are very unlikely to deaggro/dock successfully, and it's preety much only the bs which can do this (and it doesn't work for them often enough either, wether due to bumping* or just due to having too little time since you spot your tank failing to the final explosion). there is simply nothing wrong with the mechanics for sub-bs ships, and i highly suspect there's anything wrong with it when we consider capitals (which just need to be bumped).i completely disagree it has the effect of discouraging combat at all; without the ability to deagress and dock in a reasonable time frame, people would simply not agress in the first place.promoting blobbing or no, people will blob all the same, and now you don't have to worry about the target deaggro/dock-ing on a local spike, you know he's stuck there for long enough ;)so, why promote a not so supported topic? your personal agenda?*stations with 20km docking range, now there's a problem."
"meh less drama more raising of important issues and issues"
"this post is gold dust."
"and i never will do so in a private channel! the chat log is a public document and as such everything pertaining to it is also public. to permit such an 'explanation' to take place where it is not and could not be made public would go against serving the voters and players generally who, as much as i do, want to know why you acted as you did (and contrary to your own rules as you have set them out even if not accepted by other members of the csm)clearly, i am not going to get an answer from you; that much is clear. and i have to accept that you will continue to hide behind that statement. you must, therefore, accept that i will continue to feel aggrieved for that same reason.iz"
"this just in again... anyone who disagrees with jade is a goon and a goon troll. jade is always right. everything is everyone else's fault. jade's never done any wrong and is not to be questioned!you're an embarassment."
"yep and you need to accept that i still feel you have acted extremely poorly in taking your complaints over moderation decision agreed by the chair and vice chair of a meeting to the court of public sympathy where you've continued to stoke the flames of scandal and trolling. we aren't going to agree, we clearly don't have much time for each other but we have to work together for good or ill. ultimately its a matter for your own conscience whether you want to keep up the public attacks over a moderation decision you disagreed with."
"it looks like you have no issue engaging in said \"ridiculous flamewar\" though. how cute.also, what constitutes \"most sensible people\"? would that be a special group of people you haven't stereotyped and whom all agree with you? as far as i can tell reading the many posts in this forum there are a lot of people who also believe it isn't your right and you were out of line and *shock* they were not all goons. are those people all senseless though and it is ok to ignore their concerns? this seems to be the general stance you're taking."
"what part of \"public\" scares you so much? the one where you're held accountable for your actions? really i don't get the need to hide anything whatsoever. although if i acted like you i might try to obscure it as well."
"unless you propose to have censored the chatlogs before they went live, this had to take place in public - the mutings were in there, as was the subsequent debate over precisely what had happened. even if inanna had done exactly what you wanted, everybody else would still be here, and we'd still be saying the same things about your decision. the criticism started well before inanna said anything, and i doubt it'd end even if she asked it to."
"*slow claps*congratulations csm on proving the op correct. as it stands you're incapable of doing your job. take a step back, think and then shut up.things that could improve your meetings:a) strictly adhered to time limits. items failing to be completed in their times move to aob. a show of hands if the issue can be voted can be used rather than full votes in a first instance if needed.b) agenda order - game issues first, then aob, then debate about council mechanics if people still want to after 4 hrs.c) lobby ccp for an independent chair for all meetings. i suggest a ccp employee rather than a player due to the sporting chance that all members of the committee might at least treat them like a human being and also trust in their impartiality."
"welcome to the real world kiddo. and anything discussed should be public. this way we the players know if you are trying to push your own agenda. oh wait we did. system works well dont it!"
"i rather imagine darius the \"public\" that jade is trying to avoid (and with good reason) is the threadnaught mentallity that the goons installed in this game and that others have so spectacualarly carried on with.i am no fan of jade tbh in fact i voted for hardin in the elections (thought given certain recent actions on other forums i now begin to regret that) however the csm will never operate properly if it is subjected to threadnaughts from (any of the various factions) every time a csm gets there nose bent out of joint.the csm's that insitigate this ill serve themselves and the people that voted for them as it is i can see little reason for voting for any of the current candidates with the possible exception of ankh back onto the csm come next voting round."
"heaven forbid the people who the council is representing provide input or have insight into what's going on. i'm sorry but if you can't accept responsibility for your words or actions then don't commit those actions. i'm not sure what you mean by \"threadnaught\". i see a few dudes posting. goons were far from the first people to ever post on a forum in any form. some agree about some things and some disagree. it's called \"community\" even when you don't like what they have to say or it's incovenient."
"ah and there you go and misconstrue my point i never said that the public that voted (i was one of those 10% in eve that did) and those that didn't should not have input and also not have insight into what was going on with the csm please bold that for me in my post if i in fact did say that. in regards to the specific issue regarding the muting i think the csm members should be grown up enough to be able to discuss that amongst themselves with out making the circus out of it that has been made.in regards to the words threadnaught (i believe first proper usage of the term was related to a certain goon action regarding a certain developer and bob) and eve then yes goons were the first self interest group \"in eve\" to use it succefully i also clarified in my post that in terms of the current issue it was not just goons involved and indeed promoting it.you say we are a community and that people will disagree that is indeed thier right and also thier privalage however what some have latched onto is the \"mob mentality\" aka \"threadnaught\" tactic whereby in order to try and drown out any possible disagreement with thier pov they drown it out with the mob.further to the above let me reclarify that i think in balance the way jade handled things in the meeting was wrong however i would also say that certain others involved in the after effects have not exactly covered themselves in glory either and though i am sure you will not be that bothered darius none of the current csm team will garner a vote from me at the next elections ... that being said they have 5 months in which to change my mind.i closing i am hoping that what we see here is teething troubles because i had hopes that the csm would be an effective body (i also had as many fears that it wouldn't) so i for one hope you alll (no offence meant) get over yourselves and start trying to work for the good of eve."
"if i misconstrued your point i apologize. i also never meant to imply that people who voted should not be allowed to know what's going on. to be honest i find it preferable as perhaps seeing a system actually work, provided it does, will motivate them to vote the next time around. regarding \"creating a circus\" i'm a public person. if someone asks me a question or states something about me or anything i am involved in i have no problem with addressing it. we may disagree or we may agree but we're certainly able to have the conversation. i can't control people's perception of that conversation. if you find it to be circuslike then i'm sorry you feel that way. it is what it is.your vote is your vote and i'm glad you take it seriously and actually consider your decision. i wish wholeheartedly the rest of eve felt that way. i also hope that these are teething troubles, i believe they are, and i look forward to moving on with the issues we're each responsible for."
"i never said this and my organization has not sworn this. is that clear enough for you? i am the leader you're talking about in the op."
"i'd agree with this , however the \"foundational documents\" (which have been erroneously refered to a constitution, they are not, but lets treat them as one) do mention that issues are supposed to be given as much time as needed. so this idea could not be implemented.i agree with both these ideas. however it shouldn't be used as a blunt hammer to try and force debate on what the sanding rules are out of debate. as a new body corporate, the csm has a responsibility to pretty much make its standing orders and constitutional issues, priority #1"
"let me get this straight. right after the vote when the chairman confirms the resolution and no one else was allowed to speak you, \"expressed an opinion as to what was voted on\"?there are really two ways that this could be construed. 1. you were attempting to change the way the vote went to damage those who voted for it2. you were speaking out of line and out of turn in a disruptive manner for a purpose outside of the topic of discussion and deserved to be censured or removed from the meeting.oh and i am sorry where in the documentation does it say that alternates serve an entire meeting if at any point the representative cannot make it for any point?it actually says that the alternate serves when the representative cannot make it and nothing more.now there are a few problems with this. the first is that what the document says cannot be construed in any way to be broken up via meeting. the second is that this means when you kicked hardin out of the second meeting you had entirely overstepped your bounds and made up the rules of the csm from whole cloth. this is something you, as an equal member of the council, expressly have no power to do without a vote. the third is wondering what your motives are for kicking out a member of the council duly voted in by the public"
"thanks for proving the op right, guys."
"why is there a high content of goons in every \"we hate jade\" thread? no substance to posts, just their usual \"do it my way or we will ruin this game\", supported with sarcastic remarks of non-goon having no chance of being right if at least one goon is involved in debate.plus most their time is spent figuring out what it is they're doing... just collect the f...ing threads from each section and make some kind of report out of them that ccp will be able to read (as it seems forum is not their style of reading things).p.s.: yes i hate goons (in game they act like morons, why not treat them like one?). yes i hate sf as well... but seeing goons act on forums as they do in game is appalling. i just hope goons in csm don't do the same, or else this will be first and last cms we'll see (and i guess goon work will be done with that happening)."
"nothing is wrong with arguments. all involved with any politics involve their own personal beliefs and the beliefs of their constituents. i say there is nothing wrong with political discourse or arguments at all. ending discussion after someone steps out of line happens in politics. i think it is a great idea that discussion such as this happen. while \"childish\" to some it points out a candidates views and more importantly their actions. whether you like/ don't like/ don't care about the members there, they must all follow rules and the setting of those rules. perhaps a little more guidance from ccp would be acceptable. it seems much of the decision making regarding rules of conduct is left to people that may not have much in the way of guidance.bringing ideas to the forefront from a players point of view, is what i thought the csm's \"job\"...it seems as if they are doing that, and trying to do the best they can. give em all a break. relax, breathe deep, then have at it again. just be respectfulgl and keep on talking, in the end only better things will come.i disagree with white ronin, but hey, he has his opinion and i have mine, it does not devalue anything if we do not agree."
"that log was far too agressive, a couple of csm reps clearly dont value another \"mere player\" as a moderator. ccp might be worried about a corruption backlash if they were to moderate but if it was xagen etc, who would argue... no one (im specifically thinking about procedure interpretation, there should be a hot line to ccp).imo inanna zuni (amoung others) takes jades attempts to keep chat structure massively insulting, why? lol. in my mind its complete distrust and i dont think this can be resolved without ccp unfortunatelyalso this irc style format is not helpfull, hard to put emotional meaning behind the context of words. i hope that face to face meetings can stem misinterpretations of contempt.i have a new respect for bane, that for the most part seems to want a smooth process."
"i really don't want to beat a dead horse but i'd like to respond to a few assumptions here and hopefully help shine some light on intentions.firstly there is a hotline to ccp. they want to be as uninvolved in the process as possible and for the most part i think that's admirable and correct. i don't agree with anything being \"behind-the-scenes\" but for now i have to leave it at that.\"keeping chat structure\" should be secondary to allowing the debate and allowing dissent. that's part of the purpose. people are going to disagree. any time you censor someone and prevent that you're going to have a backlash. that's what happened. if you want to assume that distrust is the motivation for being upset at unnecessary censorship then that's completely your prerogative as much as it is for you to decide not to believe me when i say that the person performing the actions wasn't the problem or the cause of concern. it was the actions themselves. i'm a big enough boy to keep my mouth shut unless i feel something is wrong, in which case it is not only my desire but my responsibility to open my mouth. that's my job.inanna is far more mature and even-handed than i am, so i'm not sure where this idea that she's somehow an emotional and untrusting person comes from. simply look at her statements. she disagreed with something and i feel personally was treated wrongly especially given that this is a democratic council of 9. many others agree. that doesn't make us more or less right, it simply proves to me at least that i'm still sane.that's just my opinion on the subject. take it or leave it. to be frank while i may disagree with jade i could really care less about what it does provided it's not presuming to tell me what i can say, how i have to say it or taking what i said and changing into something else. i can't speak for anyone else in that regard.re: bane, he's a sharp boy which is why he had such overwhelming support from his peers."
"i thought this link might help - probably should have posted it when i first heard of the csm proposal..."
"would it be asking too much to suggest you cut out this referring to another person as \"it\" business? we got elected as people, we know each others names and we're going to be sitting down at a face to face conference next week. we might not like each other but referring to other council members as \"it\" is hardly helping the atmosphere at this point. you aren't going to be doing this face to face, why act this way on a public forum?"
"thank you."
"perhaps being face to face the proper word to use when referring to you in the third person will be more clear. it could also be that it was an unintentional slip, but don't let that get in the way of your persecution complex."
"\"he\" and \"him\" would be quite appropriate since we're talking in an out of character sense. if it was an unintentional slip then fair enough. but please try not to make a habit of it since it can be construed as quite insulting to refer to another human being as an \"it\". thank you."
"saying that hardin was performing sexual acts with other representatives can also be construed as quite insulting.keep up the act of feigning surprise and offense where possible like a good little two faced politician.thank you."
"considering how often you refer to yourself as a woman, the mistake must be an easy one to make. you are the worst culprit in people that confuse your gender.just look at thisjade may be right about bane; he is the expert on virtual hand-jobs."
"omg...well, i could not have seen that you would prove me so right.reported.disband the csm.use a random lottery to gather members quaterly.if they dont participate then oh well.you cant do any worse then this freak show of political parody."
"another gem from mr. easily offended"
"look, it is working, there are plently of people making [issue] threads and they are getting voted through to iceland.i think these chat logs while unpleasent is an exercise of selective reading.edit: tho commentary is good, ill be careful (as well as every other non-elected should) not to abuse my unacountability to spit notions of selfrightousness. im not doing that, i dont think i could do better."
"it bears reminding some of you that goons/red swarm federation constitute the largest unified bloc in eve. each one of us pays our $15 a month, usually in double, triplicate or more. we enjoy this game and take issues of game mechanics, balance, theorycrafting and rules/regulations very seriously. the communal aspects of the game, in terms of defining our alliance's diplomacy with other players in eve is where we don't care. goons have their communities. we're large enough to have an alliance made up of players from dozens of countries around the world. we're not here to make friends. our friends are set blue, everyone else is strangers. we fear strangers.it bears saying a second time, goons take issues of game mechanics, balance, theorycrafting and rules/regulations very seriously. the csm has afforded us to have a venue to express some issues that arise as a part of a 0 sec alliance and we are excited to see changes come of it. this is why bane was voted on to the counsel.you pubbies are free to hold whatever stereotypes, prejudices, theories, speculations or hatreds for goons, whether substantiated or not. honestly, we don't care. but there are more of us unified behind our representatives and hoping for true change that benefits the game than there are of you pubbies that give half a **** about what the csms do. that's why you see goons raising hell here.tl;dr : goons pay their $15 a month, we have the right to express opinions and/or 'threadnaught' (if you knew what an epsilon threadnaught was you'd hardly put this in the same league) if we're passionate about an issue like this. keep your prejudices and stereotypes, we hate you too. so much in fact, we've got 2 people on the council working to make positive changes that will help everyone in eve. you're welcome."
"things keep going like this and jade will be killed in a drunken rage when you meet face to face."
"that does not mean it is working, only that things labeled as \"issues\" are being passed on.that is all it proves.excuse me but the infighting and political wrangling is in every post that they make if more 1 are in the same thread.honestly.that is not selective.that is all.in other words, i dont agree so stop talking?i am not unaccountable.find me.kill me.that is pretty good accountability.the csm have freely chosen to accept responsibilities and now are not living up to them in any sense of the word.using your logic, you should stop posting because you are not accountable and i dont agree.but unlike you, i am not suggesting you dont have a right to rationally argue your perspective.they have failed and need removed.go to a random lottery and you get what you get.it is alot better then what we have now."
"guys and girls... plz stop this biggering... you are embarrising yourselves.the only thing you are achiving right now is that everybody is laughing at you about these tiny disagreements.these discussions should be done somewhere else than public forums. it only shows that you want backup from the public about your opinion... dont do that...get back on track and do this privatly instead this stupidity.if you cant hold your horses in these kind of affairs, then step down and let other people take over..."
"i think it's better that as much as possible is made public so that the eve community can judge the elected candidates performance in case the candidates decide to run for the council again."
"you'll get a series of random numbers over which you have no control. the council however was placed there via election. if you don't like your representative vote for someone else next time around. there's not much more that can be said about it."
"i cannot agree more with this post."
"guys stop fighting what you don't realize is this was all planned at the bob bbq last year in conjunction with ccp so that it would discredit the goons and fffffffffffffff"
"i just wanted to drop by and say:i smell blootfullet.o/"
"please explain how the poor behavior, infighting and basic poor performance shown by the general csm (though to be fair it seems to swirl around a few select members) and \"control\".no.you serve no purpose.you need dismissed in disgrace.you have failed.your posts show this. i only have to point people in the direction of your childish manipulations to show them the results of having elected csm.failed completely to have a positive impact.thank you.now lets stop wasting time, disband this group of corp selfservers and stop wasting time even having their forums as they are nothing but fights for illusionary power.anything would be better then this.it is really painful to watch.and the worse part is the only defense from the embarisment the csm have become is claiming that \"i didnt vote for them\".how sad is that?you have done more to prove the common player is best to keep silent and not make a choice or let their voice be heard then to get through one csm meeting in a civil and not obviously bating and distruptive manner.failure.hope we can just forget this and move on to something more productive.thank you for wasting our time.now stop doin it."
"it's called democracy, get use to it? i guess we could just continue having ccp do whatever they feel is necessary and ignore the general players until they get ****ed off enough.(also, they got through a couple of meetings pretty civil until jade decided to keep pressing his \"chair\" powers)."
"it is you.you are the failure.your posts disgrace the spirits of those who posted before you.you should resign from posting in disgrace.please explain for me your selfserving lack of sentence structure.and your inability to respond to a reasonable postyou have done more to prove that i should not read your next postthan any other bad poster that has come beforeyouplease stop wasting everyones timewiththisdrivelandaccusationthis is painfulto watchthank you for wastin my timenow stop doin it"
"people - please.first of all - to the members of the council who have taken the time to post here - thank you (whether or not i agree with you - it's nice to see you taking the time).white ronin - you hold a strong opinion and there's nothing wrong with that. i would suggest, honestly, that you run for council next time around. fix this problem from the inside. it really is the best way.i've no idea about goons or any of that. i'm far too low on the food chain and don't know any personally - so as an eve subscriber, don't care as long as they do their best to represent my interests as best they can.each and every one of us - from hardcore pvp pirates to mission runners who never leave 1.0 space are relying on you. bring the issues to ccp. try not to let your personal feelings or agendas interfere too much with your judgement (we know you're human - please just do your best). speak your mind. make eve a better place.to darius and inanna - i think you both make a lot of sense. thank you again for your words. to jade - you seem hung up on what the chair and the vice chair want to do. that's wrong. that is extremely abuseable power - for two to silence anyone in such a small, theoretically democratic, council. the people of eve will not, i think, thank you for using it or abusing it in such a way. transparency is critical to all who value democracy. so is free speech. there are other ways to moderate other than brute force. i suggest examining them.finally - as to the low vote turnout - please keep in mind that not all of eve reads these forums. many didn't understand what all the hullaballoo was about in the login messages and were more interested in playing the game than finding out. hopefully that will change next time around.at the end of the day - you are all our representatives whether we voted or not. you hold great responsibility. not power - ccp has all that, but responsibility.please use it wisely and please work together for all our betterment. we will thank you for it and you will all enjoy your positions more for it.good luck to all of you and best wishes.j.h."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"i just have a general question really, are the representatives assigned fields randomly, or because they have basic knowledge on the subjects they are in charge of.namely lavista, the 'economist' of the csm as far as i can see. i know he wrote two reports on the eve economy, but weren't these disregarded due to lack of an in depth economic knowledge or something?either way i am looking forward to see some actual results from the csm, but i seriously do hope that the people appointed actually do represent the average player in eve, and have at least some basic knowledge in the fields that they have been assigned, otherwise it could mean trouble."
"to my knowledge we haven't been assigned any fields. if we have i sure don't know what mine is. any assignation we may have as far as i know is what we gave ourselves prior to running."
"i assignation you pubbie mining reforms."
"a simple \"i disagree with it too\" would have sufficed, you didn't need to go into how he ****d your dog and killed your mother. has it occurred to you that he may actually believe what he's saying?"
"what do i have to gain from our own words being published? what does that have to do with politics? you're an absolute loon. even if only because you truly believe anyone buys into your bull****.:edit: i can't help it if you're embarassed by your own conversations. perhaps you should choose your words more wisely and not act like a baby when speaking with people."
"you know there is this funky new thing the kids are using called the interweb, wtf does a trip to iceland have to do with anything?"
"honestly, no. i have to work with the guy. i don't have to trust or like him. i am deeply suspicious of this measure and the reasons for its promotion. but hey, its my responsibility to put it on the agenda and i've done so."
"let me fill you in there cream puff... we're a public council. our official communications are public record. again... how does that help me politically?:edit: here's a hint. it doesn't. i don't need any votes."
"well no one trust or likes you, and you are a loon. that doesn't change that fact you power play all the time and the fact that the council should be able to vote on its governing not be like ohh eris discordia [ccp] who was one of those la maison people (lianhaun). help me my ability to be god emperor is in jeopardy. eris discordia you are my only hope. also learn how to not have every thing you say seem like:wall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of texti honestly believe this is a real issue."
"you think up your own silly schemes. i could ask you how having the sole channel of private communication we still have, opened to public comment and politicized debate and trolling, might help the process of the csm function. but then maybe you don't want us to be able to talk without putting on the boxing gloves and adopting the combative stances of the factions we've devolved into? who knows. any which way i think its a bad issue and will be voting against. we'll see what happens."
"my bet is on you losing, throwing a tantrum, muting any dissent then declaring the vote null after the fact. this is purely based on past experience."
"i'd be voting to get you to time meeting when the only representatives in the us could attend and not be a giant sack of meat that is out to get them. your 39 its not like you have a bed time any more."
"that's odd, because this is a guy who could pretty easily have put himself in your seat if he wanted to promote his own interests. even if you don't agree that you've been misusing the powers of the chair, i'm sure you'd agree that the powers you claim could be misused by someone with as horrible of intentions as you seem to suggest that darius has. everything he's said and done thus far that i've seen is consistent with him legitimately believing that you're all equals and the only rightful task of the chair is calling votes, and that everything should be as public as humanly possible. i use \"anarchist\" as a one-liner to describe him - it's not really accurate, but \"radical populaist\" doesn't have the same ring to it. it's not a viewpoint i stand behind, but i'll defend him against what i perceive to be unfair criticism, just like i'll defend you from the same. it's not because i see eye to eye with either of you, it's because i prefer to stand up for truth and fairness as best i can, and said truth is rather more fair to both of you than each other would like to admit. i'd make a terrible partisan politician because of it - i'm way to quick to turn on my own side in public - but it's the right thing to do if you're going to get involved in debates like this in the first place."
"i believe most documents in the house of lords and house of commons are public. surpisingly enough their private correspondences, phone calls, messages and meetings are not. further, almost all committee's have un-minuted business to discuss issues frankly and bluntly. otherwise we get all sorts of crap being thrown about in public.jade, might be good to just state the agenda and step back. seriously consider taking the alloted meeting time, divide it between the issues over 90% and set 10% as aob. if an issue fails to make it to a vote in its time limit then it gets canned to aob. if it fails there then it gets canned to the next meeting."
"yeah moving administrative stuff to the end does actually sound like a damn good idea - i think i'll do it"
"this isn't the house of lords but either way i'm willing to bet they held an actual vote or something to decide that. i'm unfamiliar with that political system but here in america we agree on and publish our rules prior to stating their existence."
"nope disagree on this. on reviewing serenity's statement on the issue (list) i'm happy with the wording. it was intended to be a private mailing list and specifically stated as such - while this motion is to publicize its content. motion stands as stated."
"i'll try again. pretty much all political structures have back channels of communication not open to the public. belief that you can define all council business as public is just naieve.ever tried getting minutes of republican whips meetings with senators when they're trying to encourage them to vote? :)"
"now step away from the agenda :p"
"i'm naive then. i thought this was a videogame space council not the un."
"it's a committee trying to get work done. the pitfalls for such groups are pretty universal, as are the ways of getting around them - it doesn't matter if you're the house of commons or the greater tuktoyaktuk rotary club, you want to have a back channel you can use to smooth things over without getting into ****ing matches or meeting formalities."
"i don't personally have any need for secret meetings. if i did i'd say hey mister this is a secret meeting and you could decide whether it remained so. if you spilled the beans then i'd know never to tell you another secret. v0v"
"yup, that's about how it works. hence my comment about the 8-man mailing list."
"yet constantly argue it should mirror real world systems? surely not.if its not really meant to be taken seriously why bother doing it? near enough any committee / executive board has off the record channels of communication with each other, its one of the ways to thrash out differences before meetings informally so that things don't get so heated under time pressure in the meetings. it helps alot with committee cohesion.what reason is there to see every single word a committee says during informal discussion? their decisions can only be voted on during meetings and they are minuted. as long as any issue debated is outlined clearly in the meeting then debates where opinions collide noticeably will be recorded and stuff will actually get done."
"mailing lists by nature have multiple members and aren't assumed to be private fyi. at least not where i come from. perhaps there's a cultural difference here."
"where did i say it's not meant to be taken seriously? my statement which you've misconstrued was meant to say that real world rules need not apply here. if they did they'd have been documented. that's how i do things in the real world. i document them to let everyone know what they are.what reason is there not to see what the entire council discusses? i'm not talking about private personal emails. i'm talking about communications sent to everyone. we may end up having to agree to disagree because i really don't have a problem with everything i write as a representative of the council being posted anywhere on the internet... my actions are public actions."
"its to do with ease and convenience for councillors darius. councillor a has some suggestions and wants peoples feedback, he mails council mailing list for a chat. alternatively, he mails each one individually... whats the difference?"
"why would this exchange need to be kept private?"
"because we only have so many csm meetings and because people need to discuss things before meetings if they're going to get anything done."
"i agree, jade, i agree."
"the difference is that the first one works way better, and that only the second would be private if darius' motion passes.edit: misread quoted post."
"in one he emailed a list and in one he emailed each councilor individually... the size of the \"to\" field would be one notable difference. as i've said where i come from lists are treated differently. if the councilors don't want me discussing what they say on the list then they're free to remove me from their conversations they wish to remain private and use the list for announcements necessary for the csm. as i've said to them and here i had no reason to believe this was some super secret list and i'd made them all aware of that. if you do not wish me to talk about a conversation then either tell me so or don't have it. i've never been anything other than honest."
"dammit, i have to quit hitting \"quote\" instead of \"edit\"...maybe they don't want to risk looking like an idiot publicly? maybe they want to duck controversy by doing a straw poll on an issue and then backing down? maybe they're proposing something that their corpmates will hate?"
"both would be allowed if the motion passes. the list would be public. if people want to have a private conversation nothing's stopping anyone from doing so. i don't control the internet."
"if you don't want to get caught with mud on your hands don't play in wet dirt."
"true, i thought the word \"private\" was in the post i quoted. my bad - it's fixed above.i don't want people feeling forced to not do the right thing because it might damage their public persona. there's no way to arrange face-saving if everything is public, at a minimum."
"do the right thing and be proud of it. i'm sorry but i honestly don't see how \"doing the right thing\" and \"public\" are mutually exclusive. at the end of the day your vote's going to be public anyway. you are accountable to the public. i don't get why anyone should try to hide anything unless they've deliberately mislead people. you may not agree but that's my opinion."
"i have to ask, when you signed up to that mailing list, did your read the eula because if it specified privacy like most lists then you're in breach...i'm not on the committee darius but where you come from (america i believe) mailing lists are either open or closed, the same as everywhere else in the world.if you're not willing to keep a private mailing list private, you should remove yourself, not wait to be removed."
"the eula, which i'll admit i didn't read until yesterday, forbids the reposting of emails. an act which has not been done. i have talked about some of the discussions the council has had on that mailing list, an act not forbidden by anything. nobody and no eula can forbid me from discussing my experiences. if i relay entire conversations that's one thing. me saying lol jade is renaming all the subject lines like that proves some point what a tool! violates nothing. where i come from nothing is private unless explicitly stated as such in a clear and concise manner. i'll also note that i did not ever request to be a member of any mailing lists. if the admin wants to remove me, then he can remove me. something i've also said to the admin and the entire council."
"darius had personal permission to post the private communications that he posted. this trumps any such privacy agreement.why is this true? well because darius only shared his communications. which he has the express right to do."
"some people are a lot less devil-may-care than you. face-saving compromise is necessary to a lot of people on occasion, and i'd rather not cut it off at the knees just because it's something you don't intend to make use of."
"and i never stated that he'd reposted anything anywhere though it is interesting that he did and that he hadn't read the eula.suffice to say, a method where members of csm members can debate issues informally in private is useful. arguing that you don't want to therefore everyone elses discussions should be public isn't really an argument. remember, this has to work past just this iteration of the committe."
"then let people have private conversations. i'm not stopping them. leave me out of it."
"i'm sorry but i can't be any clearer than saying \"if you want something to be private tell me so or don't send it to me\". i didn't ask to be added to any mailing lists or receive any emails.also... i posted my own emails. so what? they're mine. it's my right to decide they're not private. nobody else has that right."
"andi think you can save a lot of time now then darius and just drop that agenda item as you've just conceded that even you think that people should be able to have their own private conversations.i'd also suggest that at this point you should probably leave that mailing list as its clear you don't support its purpose. or you could wait to be removed but i don't see what that would achieve tbh."
"like i said, that's exactly what i expect will happen if full disclosure of everything you see is how you want to do things. i can hardly make you stop, i can just suggest that you're being counterproductive and trying to tie the csm's hands, present and future, into a poor way of doing business."
"most legal opinion on the subject holds a full disclosure right to recipients of emails. in many (most? its possibly different in the us which has some very strange copyright laws) cases the laws transfer full reproduction rights to recipients. regardless fair use means your always allowed to reproduce a mail.you know those attachments on mail that says \"you may not reproduce this email blah blah\" ? there isn't a court in the world that holds those things valid. they are the equivalent of the shop sign that says \"no refunds\", totally invalid.edit: exception to above. generally if the inbox is owned by your employer, the mail becomes property of the company, as you recieved it in the role of a servant of the entity."
"to your first point the agenda item and people's private conversations are mutually exclusive. the two items are not related. as i did state i don't control the internet. nor do you or the csm. have private conversations. do them in private places. the way the list was used council statements and rules were handed down and defined among other things. i think that should be part of the public record. nothing i've said contradicts that.i never asked to be on the mailing list. i cannot remove myself and i didn't add myself. i already said that as well. twice."
"i was trying to avoid the legal argument on purpose jane as now i expect a flood of e-lawyers. what you've said is however correct."
"edit: ok. sorry darius. i'll back down on the e-lawyering."
"oh the main issue at hand there though, which i'm sure people will bring up, is that only two of the recipients were american. this is the main reason no emails were ever published save my own. i am not familiar with their laws nor do i care to be."
"a mailing list you can opt out of recognises that a committee has collective needs to discuss issues and provides an easy method of facilitating this.you can of course opt out as you've stated. they're hardly mutually exclusive.you just argued against your own argument conclusively. the committee needs to have tools when you're long gone. you've conceded people can, do and will have private discussions. the objective of a mailing list is to allow for more conscise and meaningful debate in actual csm sessions. these are public.your argument for making it public is that you want it that way. that is your entire argument based on the last page and a half and simply isn't a reason to do it. meeting should likely go, agenda item open, say your piece, someone summarises reasons against, council votes. over in about 5mins.or, given you've concluded its personal choice and people can opt out, it doesn't even need to be on the agenda as trying to limit peoples ability to have personal discussions, even about csm issues, is not within your remit."
"you can restate your version of my statements until you're blue in the face. i'll prefer to say your statements are yours and mine are mine. don't make a different statement than i did and say it's mine. i said all group communications should be public at the very least where they involve council duties. saying i didn't say that or saying i said something else doesn't change it. my statements are obvious because they have my name next to them. not yours.really i can only continue to respond to this with the same things i've already said. it appears you disagree. that's your prerogative and i respect your opinion. a circular argument i will not have. fyi, you can disagree without editorializing other people's statements."
"i agree to disagree then. i hope the meeting is smoother this time."
"that makes two of us."
"all email unless deemed security sensative are public. in the us govt. i know this as i have had a few of my emails made public due to the freedom of information act. now in jades char view over her subjects. the commitee shouldnt allow anything public. perhaps the chair should have ccp fund a kgb style unit. darius will be taken in the middle of the nite and shot his acct canceld and a fake post made in his name stating that he was reallyy a wow player all along and wanted to make elfs in eve the whole time. thus a trator to eve! all crap aside. it seems the evil darius of goons wants to make sure theres no question of his dedication to the players. and not his corp/aliences. and this i applaud him for. as for jane. step down your not winning support your just makeing things worse with every word you type."
"look at minnie capitals dammit."
"goum, give up.find something else to troll. you come across as just about anything but sincere.jade is chair. chair has power to moderate. argue all you like about whether they should be the only one with ops or if a paraphrased vote didn't implicitly mean that. chair outlined rules for speaking and consequences. chair enacted those rules. a member of the committee refused to acknowledge the chairs authority to maintain order in the meeting. sucks to be them, they are wrong.should the chair have absolute power or should they be given guidelines? i'd say guidelines. who gives the guidelines? ccp.issue isn't really more than a waste of time at player level."
"ccp needed a neutral chair the moment they dreamed up this mess. jade is unable to distance him or herself from the matters that are being discussed. things degrade as a partial moderator has no power to actually moderate. in addition jade believes that this chair position has some sort of god power to mandate things. it doesn't. sorry...i would envision a ccp employee who chairs and gives different people the floor to speak. even though they are somewhat biased it won't be some half crazed madman who has no ability to communicate with people of this reality."
"meeting moderaion has a different traditional meaning to chat channel moderaation. i grant is vague, but it does seem to be clarified with the notion that the committe is democratic.i would thus argue that no, the mute power isn't implied by it at all."
"i agree yorda, ccp will do nothing they don't want to, and it's silly of the document to pretend that they will.martin, dictatorships function with a rational leader, but they fail if an irrational leader comes to power. that does not mean that dictatorship is a functioning form of government. the great success of the us constitution is that it has been more robust than the leaders that have tried to change it, and so should the csm document."
"those dictators have at least proven they can lead a country."
"hey, nobody here is saying that goons are universally straight-laced, moderate, reasonable people - tress is, from the looks of it, an avatar of at least 40% of what's wrong with the internet. but in a group of 5000 people, there's bound to be at least a few rational, intelligent ones, and you ignore them at your own peril. and that's not even getting into your non-goon detractors - is hardin a barking duck? am i?"
"a fair point, but given that jade lives in a country ruled by gordon brown, i think jade could lead a country just as well."
"ok there has to be a point when common sense in these matters comes in to play. if the csm and the playerbase can not actually tell the difference between internet space ships and a frigging monster truck, well there is no wonder ccp has the attitude they do. i would too.this makes absolutely no sense."
"dude its lord emperor jade palatine why would he have to make any sense he has all the power to do whatever he wants."
"i propose the inclusion of the drone module proposal. considering that when the drone issuses get presented to ccp, the module and implant issues should be presented together, since there are obvious balancing challenges affecting both.(not sure if this was the right place to post this, since it is quite hard to find stuff in here and the assembly hall atm)"
"back to timing a moment, i'm not quite sure why it has only just hit me but i'm partially double-booked this evening with a 'real life' meeting also taking place (probably because it was originally going to be last thursday and got postponed a week, which i hadn't twigged was the same evening as this csm meeting!) anyway, the other meeting starts at 7pm uk (ie 6pm eve) and isn't too far from my home, so i will hope to be online by 8pm eve. i'll take my laptop and mobile connection dongle too so worst case is that i am battery powered in the car ;-piz"
"just in case of connection problems then can i ask you to make sure you mail in a list of vote preferences on the multi item issues that we do need to vote for this evening please?"
"well jade, i tallied the votes in that thread and out of 75 votes only 36 were from goonswarm. that actually makes us the minority but nice try at trying to write off everything you disagree with as a goon conspiracy. i think if it came down to a vote between your horrible destructible outpost idea and the monster truck one most people would say yours is worse. 16 pages of discussion and only 39 votes of support is terrible. 5587 people viewed your thread and the vast majority chose not to support it. *snip* please resist the urge to end a post with a flame - mitnal"
"is it possible to join the channel as an observer?these things are comedy gold, and would be fun to watch live while ratting.we should also set up a second commentary channel for viewers to chat about the slapstick antics live as they happen."
"um, not to throw too big a wrench into these statistics but that doesn't indicate that 5587 people viewed the thread but rather that the thread have been viewed on 5587 different occassions. it could easily mean that the thread was viewed 100 times each by 55 different people.which is exactly why this forum really needs the potential to vote aginst a proposal as well as for it. either that or only add to the views count on the very first time you view a thread. then you'd get a more accurate idea of what the true level of support for an issue."
"no, he's saying that if you trained thousands of ****roaches to vote for you it doesnt make the issue worth dealing with. the problem with this was always going to be goons collectively thinking they can force issues by getting the person using the alliance braincell to tell everyone else to vote for something.unfortunately for ****roach-swarm this int working and you are now all having a massive cry fest because you cant have your own way. if u dont like it, quit, the game would be better for it...but hey let me guess, i just \"dont get goons\"... well, thats no probem. i dont get ****roaches either, it doesnt make them anything other than nasty little grubs."
"meeting 4 is concluded, we discussed the documentation and debated the multi-item issues. took almost 3 hours with some good high quality debate from the csm reps in attendance. big thanks to everyone for this. serenity should be adding the chatlogs to the csm site soon, but until then i've posted the log on the jericho public forums and is viewable here.enjoy. next meeting is on sunday."
"you mean buy isk from isk farmers.sigh."
"is there a list of issues that the csm have voted on and the result? after browsing through the logs most of what i've seen is them voting on themselves in some way or another. it might be a good idea to have a results thread so we can see what is going on."
"edited because i was completely wrong"
"on the left nav under eve insider there's now a csm link. from there you can find the meeting minutes. they should contain an abbreviated version on the meetings which should include votes.the last meeting may not be up there yet as these are added by ccp. you may have to parse that from the chatlogs at eve-csm.com"

"they look out for themselves and their own that's why most of them ran on a platform of pet issues."
"wow, i see this forum actually is very useful. now i can learn all of the games best exploits long before ccp actually bothers getting around to fix them. super!"
"if you consider this whining .. you really need to get off the computer and go get a girlfriend ..."
"pitboss, i really intended to get involved with this discussion and there is still time to get it on the agenda for sunday. i do have a issue with the proposal as you've stated it on the thread though ... and thats about what happens to my gang mate's wreck flagging if we lose a ship fighting in hisec against war enemies. is it our enemies that get to \"own\" the wreck for the purpose of flagging other neutral thieves that come and steal it? how about both the corporation/gang mates of the victim + the kill get dual ownership of the wreck - so anybody stealing from it gets flagged to both parties?how does that sound? can you work it into the proposal somehow?we've still got time to get this heard for sunday - let me know what you think and if we can sort out some agreement on that dual ownership thing i'll advocate and raise the issue for you."
"wait a second. pit boss had a decent support and response. and he has to change his proposal because you do not agree with it as such. your agenda made the list and it did not even get even close to the same type of support. how does that work? that has been my point. i.e. the removal of the learning skills issue fell flat on its face support wise. and the op had by no means changed anything that would make any sense.so how does this work? he made the mark of 7 days at least, garnered strong support, and the ratio was much higher than the ones that is currently on the list."
"listen. scream at me for taking an interest and actually getting involved in the discussion if you want. or maybe i could just ignore it and go away because i'm tired of the childish claptrap on this forum. the pure amount of time thats been wasted this week over the most irrelevant rubbish is astounding. so why don't you just shut up and let pitboss answer. its his damn thread, if you want to join the mob its -> that way."
"i don't view \"whine\" as a pejorative per se - i've described some of my own threads as \"whine threads\" before. nonetheless, your tl;dr is \"you didn't pick me! you're all self-serving jerks!\" - if that's not whining, i don't know what is. as for getting a girlfriend, there's not enough sex in the world to keep me from being an overeducated *******. i'd definitely have less time to post here if i had access to all the sex in the world, of course, but it wouldn't change my opinion of what you have to say if i still managed to see it."
"wow, nice. you are really showing your true colors. couldn't find the mute button so you decided to try to shout me down. i was not screaming at you in this thread. i was actually asking questions to fully understand how this works. i was very calm as i wrote that and actually was looking for a real answer? i am not sure how you read that as a challenge. but i guess you have some issues or something you need to work out or did i hit a nerve of some kind? and as far as yhis is \"his thread\" is poppy****. it is posted in a public forum and telling me to go away is not with in your power sir. i am not a part of any mob, and i am an independent player that has an interest on how this game is played."
"thanks for your prompt response jade ... i will post something to the effect on dual ownership and what not in a bit after i've sat down and thought it out ... the reason for this is because i do realize that there has to be a compromise to get this topic on the agenda ... and many thanks for giving it the opportunity.my answer may not be the best one ... but i am willing to put forth another effort to get something fixed that i personally (and others) may feel is broken to the satisfaction of the majority."
"then i'd advise you re-read what you wrote. and revisit your tone, and ask the questions with a more neutral phrasing that doesn't immediately move to accusation and condemnation. i felt its entirely ridiculous for you to criticize me for suggesting an alternation to the issue that would let me support it with a clear conscience. isn't that exactly what we're supposed to be doing - engaging with player issues and supporting those we feel are a genuinely good idea for the game?honestly yes, i did snap at you but its not been a very productive day for csm issues and i found it disappointing that actually having a couple of minutes to look at a genuine issue again turns back into the accusation-charged environment elsewhere on these forums today. people are human farrqua - even csm reps."
"yeah i do apologize for taking a while to get round to this but the dual ownership thing was the compromise that a lot of people i've asked about it felt would be needed. it is a fairly complicated issue in that respect. the basic principle you know i love - more pvp opportunity in empire and consequence for theft is great. just needed that tweak really. fingers crossed we can get it through the csm now. all the best."
"wow jade, this is apublic discussion forum, the thread does not belong to the op. you are totally clueless aren't you?"
"my tone was apparently created on your end. trying to milk the tone or poster of someone from cold text without observing gestures, tone of voice or eye contact is a wee bit silly i think. and a little presumptuous. however i will return in kind as it has been in previous posts towards me. yes we all are human, and we do at times see the boogie man under every rock when we think we are being prosecuted.from someone outside of the current debacle of political posturing from the different sides and factions, i am not all that confident in this process. i am on 2nd life here in eve. started and watched the game grow and expand from the beginning. and as a player form the masses that voted in the hope for change, i feel obligated to debate, and comment where i feel and in the manner i feel as it best meets the current tone form the csm and its chair."
"dude, valium."
"i don't have particular interest in jade constantine, but i do find the anti-jade people amusing.this is turning into classic democratic politics - the politics of never ending arguments, where nothing can be done, where people waste entire time talking about silly irrelevant things that look absolutely ridiculous to outside observer.jade is fighting against that. lets see if csm people can do better than the usa congress"
"as one of the minority who actually voted, can i please request the csm members take a deep breath, forget the previous meetings, and actually get on with it?for those members who have been trying to do that which they were elected to do, namely represent us, apologies for any of this. for those members busy trying to de-rail the proceedings, you should be ashamed of yourselves. i've seen 12-year olds act with more maturity.edit: i mean, come on, you spent ages arguing over the definition of the word abstain. it has a definition already, no need to invent a new one. use that and move on!yes, it's clear various people screwed up. better that it's put in the past and learned from instead of people arrogantly claiming they did no wrong.ask yourself this: are you politicians, or representatives?politicians lie a lot in their manifestos and then do exactly what they feel like, based on their personal issues.representatives on the other hand are about putting their own views aside and seeing the big picture, what both the majority and minorities need and want, whether vocal or not, and what benefits all of eve.which is it to be?"
"i think this is a good post. it hit the nail right on the head."
"there's a meeting tonight. what more do you want? i'm at work typing a document right now. if you don't like what people have to say on forums don't read it. the csm is exactly that, a council. not some collection of people who should be forced to live up to 200k people's individual opinions on morality or behavior. that's simply unrealistic."
"what if they're political representatives?"
"i think the problem has been that the representatives haven't been allowed to do their job due to being suppressed and marginalized at every turn. the representatives were elected to do a job, if someone is silencing their opinion (ianna), not allowing them to replace their alternate (hardin), or otherwise preventing them from doing their job should they just try to continue anyway? i don't think so. if my elected representative's voice isn't being heard i don't want anyone else's to be. until true democracy is restored this whole thing is a farce and you might as well just let jade be a dictator and make all the decisions."
"thank you.who said anything about forcing? or morality? the fact that you are being defensive implies you feel you acted improperly but aren't prepared to admit that. i for one did not name names or point fingers, so why do you feel you are being singled out here? you seem to be placing yourself in one camp; i did not put you there.from your statements you clearly feel that you don't represent everyone, and that's fine; differing points of view are always good. there is however a difference in representing a point of view and believing that to be the only one. all i am asking is that the former happens, not the latter.true, i'm just one person, but i don't think it's an unreasonable request.edit: quite why some seem to feel that the moment these sorts of things are said, it automatically applies to the goons, is beyond me. it applies to everyone."
"i'm going to ask you to do the same as i've asked other people. allow me to speak for myself. if i felt i acted improperly i'd have said so. i don't. i didn't place myself in one camp. god did. i am one person who speaks for myself. your statement was a blanket statement regarding behavior and mine was a blanket response regarding the same.i agree with you that there are to be differing points of view. as a matter of fact i've said it over and over and over again. at least 3 or 4 times today.believe me. i didn't believe your statement applied only to me or was directed at me. that doesn't change my statement in any way nor does it make my statement purely about me. the third sentence is the only sentence in that paragraph that relates directly to me."
"fair enough. as with all internet discussions, what appears to be implied is all too easily mis-read. it does sometimes get a little difficult in threads with the level of hostility some manage to put across. apologies for getting the wrong end of the stick."
"the system is completely broken. implying that everyone should just \"get on with it\" without offering any solutions as to how to do that is completely non-constructive. it's like everyone who tells ccp to \"fix the lag ffs tbfh\". yes, everyone wants to the fix the lag, ccp is already trying to fix the lag, you have added absolutely nothing to the achievement of that goal."
"actually, the system isn't broken. what it takes is the csm delegates to actually focus on game issues not their personal issues with each other. some are trying to, clearly. i'm just asking for a little sense to be applied. i call that very constructive since hardly anyone else has actually said that. i've seen a lot of grandstanding and wringing of hands by a lot of posters, and not much constructive input at all."
"yes because when the chair person is abusing their power to control the meeting to their own whims there is totally nothing wrong."
"having read the transcripts, i have to say that it seems that these meetings are useless and mired in political squabbling, self importance and maneuvering to get a personal nanophoon of eve. i know that this might come across as harsh to the csms but lets remember who they are supposed to be working for ... us, the player base. the csms need to stop working on pork barrel and start working on the main issues that eve has. if they don't, i will be proposing a recall election. since guidelines for csms seem to be wanting, here are some of the issues you should be discussing. 1) problems in the ui and especially the corporate interface. i swear all of you should lock and then unlock 500 blueprints and run a large corp.2) long term direction for revising the rules of sovereignty. basically moving eve to the point where kingdoms can be established and what the dynamics of that are. deployable faction bubbles and gate guns? locked stargates between sov3 systems? 3) evaluation of the security status system and if it is achieving its stated aims. if not, proposals for modifications of the system. 4) evaluation of problems that still persist in the ui and prioritization of resolving these issues (50,000 1kb files in the log directory leaps to mind). 5) evaluation of new technologies such as black ops, jump freighters and so on and suggestion of where they should go in a general sense and preliminary ideas of how to get them there. 6) evaluation of the jita issue. do we make all of the forge an insta-delivery zone? how can we encourage markets to spread out and diversify?7) additional economic tools needed by trading players such as long term charts, galaxy wide economic evaluation based on expensive to train skills and so on. 8) evaluation of the structure of alliances. a dictatorship alliance has been promised 4 years now, lets get it delivered. 9) other wide sweeping concepts of concern to the majority of the player base, not just your corp, alliance or play style. get moving or step down and let someone else take your place. form a list of these issues and then tackle them one at a time and then make recommendations. you have a lot of credibility to earn. you were elected to do a job, not put a feather in your cap. -- rells"
"i hate to burst your bubble since you obviously took quite a bit of time to make this post but many of the issues you've posted have already been voted into the agenda in iceland. i'm about to leave for home so i can't address each one but you may want to check out the minutes, which will include vote results.you can find them on a csm link on your left nav on this site or www.eve-csm.com.any issues which aren't there can be raised in the other forum created specifically for raising issues.i'm sure you know this already though because you read the transcripts."
"large majority of those issues are already very well covered. please refer to the minutes that was published today."
"/me wipes tears from eyes. oh dearie me. what a facepalm moment that was."
"i believe other forum systems have this curious notion called a... oh what is it called... oh yes, a poll i am somewhat surprised we don't."
"then you haven't spent much time in there. i've only been reading it for about four months and seen quite a few ccp replies and stuff that then made it into dev blogs. you're talking rubbish, do some research."
"what needs to be implemented is more sub folders, broken into the 4 races plus 1 for alliances and a non postable folder for popular where only csm members can move very popular threads for wider discussion.under those then you add folders for items like pos mechanics, sovereignty and ship classes. this would reduce alot of the multiple threads on the same subject.next you need a vote meter implemented viewable from the thread title but not requiring a response post, just login and vote, 1 vote per account per thread."
"um i will admit hot keys were something i was suprised the game didnt have or even binding of certain keys. i have gotten used to it. but i dont see why not to have it looked at. so support i will."
"locked.troll."
"i'm going to support this ... adding it to the agenda on sunday as well. only proviso i'd make is that there should be some kind of dual-ownership of wrecks (for the purpose of aggression-flagging) both the gang mates of a destroyed ship and the people on the killmail of the destroyed ship, should have ownership rights on the wreck in my opinion. everyone of these people should be able to fire on a looter stealing from an involved wreck. any which case adding it as an issue to be raised and hopefully we get to discuss it with ccp."

"approved and signed!"
"i would advise you read this thread here it's a about dual monitors and it contains a reponse from ccp whisper. let me copy and paste it actually.\"a long time ago eve had dual monitor support, but it caused a lot more game-stopping problems than it was worth. reinstating this is on our huge, extensive, massive, just plain long wishlist of things we want to do.right now the only dual screen thing people manage to do is stretch the display across two screens by setting a custom resolution in their drivers and getting eve to use that. usually horizontally, which means you end up with two halves of the hud on either monitor. personally that would annoy the living daylights out of me.i haven't seen anyone stretch it vertically though...probably because to do this you would need a more intricate monitor mounting. which is what you are building, so it would be worth a shot. i'd figure thing like the neocom and station services would still have all functional elements on one monitor, probably the top one. you can of course move the in-space ui elements to wherever you need them.not sure how having two really wide monitor bezels breaking up the image would feel though...as stated, i find even just the vertical split irritating...having a long horizontal split would be even more intrusive.\""
"make it 3 monitors so that u can have the splits be more intuitive"
"my emotions after multi-screen eve is implemented:i support!"
"so we all agree that the naglfa is terrible at the moment.in the interest of keeping this thread active, what needs to be done to fix it?i'm thinking it might not be the capitals that need a buff but the weapon systems them selves. if capital artillery and auto cannons had a built in gyro ii buff would this mitigate their low dps.i would even suggest a minor buff to the damage from the citidal torp launcher as well as well dependent on not over powering the phoenix which i hear also has underwhelming damage potential."
"without getting in to the numbers, the naglfar's best shot at matching the dps of other capitals is to fill it's lows with damage mods and then have a subpar shield tank. the alternative is to go for no damage mods and a standard armor tank, or some dreadful half armor tank with a couple of damage mods. any way you slice it there's no real way to make it match up to the tank/dps levels of the other capitals."
"nothing to add other than a thumbs up."
"i think a general buff of minmatar tech 1 xl / l ammo would help a lot (even s/m/ t2 artillery ammo buff wouldn't really effect nanoships while greatly improving the bs and above that desperately need help)i would like to see the single ship bonus per weapon type (torps and projectiles) be turned into two (basically add an rof/damage bonus on top of the other bonus), a major cpu buff to the nag (so that it doesn't need co-processors to fit a shield tank), and more mid slots (less low slots) so that the nag can fit a more respectable tank.a rate of fire buff built into capital projectile / torp damage would also help the phoenix and naglfar without making either too strong."
"naglfar suggested changes.objective - weaker than average tank but greater than average dps.drop a mid slot for two low slots. turn it into an clear armor tanker by slot layout changes.do not buff citadel torpedoes but buff capital artillery substantially."
"the biggest problem stems from the fact that it has 1 less mid+low to handle having 5 highs. the is the general crux of split weapon design. it works on the typhoon because it has more drone bw than the average bs. the can't exactly be done at the dread level, esp w/o trampling on the moroes. that said, the moroes is like a dominix that can fit 8 bonused turrets.even if artillery and cit torps were buffed, they wouldn't scale well due to the nag's slot imbalance. giving up a mid/low for the extra high (that doesn't equal superior dps) just seems like a design failure. even with some damage mods in the lows, the ship doesn't have the cpu to shield tank well. so much for versatility.ccp needs to get out of the fixed # of slots per ships or compensate in another fashion (like on the phoon) if they want to make split weapon systems work well. or even better, make my suggestions. basically make it \"on par\" or keep the weak tank and buff the dps: a). make it 100% artillery. balance xl artillery so that 3x are in the same ballpark as the other dreads. take away a high and either set it up to shield tank like the phoenix or armor tank like the moroes. hell, give it a mael tanking bonus. there aren't enough shield tanking caps as it is, and minmatar still will have to train. at least then it can scale with dmg mods, and wont always be insta primaried. alternative is to make it 3x artillery and 1x torp to make it scale better with dmg mods.b). balance it so the extra skills training pays off for torps + projectiles. to do so, you'd need to make it do the most raw dps w/o dmg mods, but slightly below average with less than perfect skills.c). balance the dps so its \"on par\", but make it a shield tanker, so it can use its lows for dmg mods. it currently lacks the cpu and slot layout to do this. none of these are really new ideas."
"i think the simplest solution to this would be to add an anchoring/onlining queue, so you can just queue up your anchoring and onlining commands at the beginning and don't have to sit there clicking things every five minutes. it'll still take 6-8 hours to construct a fully functional pos, but it removes the tedium aspect from the process. also, in addition to the existing anchoring process, add an \"anchor top\" and \"anchor bottom\" command that will automatically anchor the module in question at the top or the bottom of the pos, as close to the tower and as close to the vertical axis of the tower as possible, so you can queue up a typical pos setup without having to drag around the annoying green box for every single module."

"the mechanism to setup and manage pos's right now is pretty bad. fully support this."

"removing local = removing the only viable ratter/miner/etc defense. spamming scan 360 isn't much of an option.but i have to admit, it would make the game more interesting. of course, nerfing gate camping and/or warp jamming would be nice, too."
"outstanding contribution to this thread....i give you guys a -9 out of 10 for your effort and ability to see the big picture instead of your own narrow minded portion of the picture. to think of local as your only viable defense is why you die to pirates and gank squads.this game is about thinking, adapting, and teamwork. this is why the majority of all updates to the game are \"team oriented\". this is a multiplayer game, not a single player game. if this change is made it would make it that much more important for players to work as a team to get things accomplished. players would have to depend on teamwork to get through dangerous areas of space, just like with real life. i don't see a local chat when i go into the wrong end of town telling me there is a guy there ready to mug me.what the op is suggesting is an outstanding way to improve not only pvp (not just pirating) but also a way for miner's and haulers hide more efficiently. no more will a small gank squad be able to roll into a system and instantly see who is there. if the miners or haulers use a scout on ingates and in scan spots they will know when a hostile or shady character enter's system and will be able to warn his gang members....open your eyes and look at both sides of the picture.if you use team work within this game you can eliminate half of the idiotic carebear kills in the game, but those who die while mining, ratting and hauling die because they are doing it alone and/or without a scout. this game wasn't built for solo play...it was build for team play and once you start playing as such you will see how much more productive you can and will be."
"a chat channel should not be used for intel. 100% behind this."
"i would be for this but \"active pilots in space\" option on the map would have to be removed to make it workable for ambushes and fair for carebears. until then no support.ps. perhaps also as compensation, show a standings column on the scanner otherwise i think gathering intel will be too tedious."

"[issue] ccp has not updated the mac and linux communities on the status of development on their clients since the trinity 1.1 release and has missed several self-imposed delivery dates for a premium content client for those platforms, yet has still not let the community know when they can be expected or whether development is even ongoing.[problem] i am one of a number of people who only started playing eve because the mac and linux clients were made available. i no longer use those clients exclusively, but they are still the most easily available platforms for me. unfortunately, i and many other users of those clients are growing increasingly frustrated with the complete lack of communication from ccp on the status of:1) the \"disco box\" bug, in which the starfield is replaced with random visual noise that often requires the client to be restarted to clear and is almost painful to look at2) the f11 inset map being filled with static3) frequent crashes that often require the computer to be rebooted in order to launch the eve client once again4) and of course, our own premium content client, which ccp originally promised to deliver in the first quarter of 2008, then later said would be delivered with the empyrean age expansion. now, it's totally understandable that there be some issues. ccp is not familliar with either of these platforms, the clients are new, and it's not the primary focus on their user base. the *problem* is that ccp has not been forthcoming about the status of these issues. many users in the mac community are beginning to wonder if ccp has silently halted development on the non-windows clients. we have repeatedly requested status updates in the forums, and have gotten no response. furthermore, many of us were greatly disappointed to see that there were no os-specific bug fixes in the release notes. i haven't encountered the disco box since the ea update, but the f11 map is definitely still broken, and the client crashes as much as it ever did.possible solution: therefore, i beseech the council of stellar management to take up our case. we're not asking you to browbeat ccp into fixing these issues. we'd be happy just to have *some idea* of what's going on. if the answer is \"ccp does not feel that the mac and linux user base is valuable enough to continue client development on those platforms\", well, that's fine. we just want to know so we can go on with our lives. and if the answer is \"ccp is actively working on osx and linux client development\", that's great! but we'd really, really like to hear how that's going. and not just how it's going now -- we'd like to continue to get regular status updates. this silence is upsetting the community more than being told \"no\" to our requests would. it's making us feel like ccp doesn't even care enough about us to tell us that it doesn't value us as customers. please, csms, ask ccp to tell us what's happening and where we go from here."
"+supportcommunication is a good thing, especially when the same bugs and instabilities exist through 3 patch releases and delivery dates for the promised premium client slip. it's understandable that ccp has to rely on transgaming as part of the developme"
"completely agreed. i'm a multi-platform player and i am frustrated at the lack of communication from ccp about the status of mac client in particular. just give us a realistic road map that you'll stick to or tell us you're ending support. although with the macmarket share up around 10% that's potentially a pretty large user base.i support kesper's request for the csm to assist in moving this issue forward with ccp."
"+1ccp has time to talk with apple news sites, but not with their paying customers?"
"supporting this"
"most definitely. give my mac some love?"
"consider this on this list. it won't make it to iceland i'm affraid, too late for that, but it's in the pipeline. and if there's time to spare in the meetings, i'll try to squeeze a comment out of them."
"there is a laundry list of issues with the cedega linux client, to the point that anyone not running eve under wine is just silly. please either provide better hooks for wine or get someone competent working on the official client."
"yes"
"i was originaly going to switch fully to linix when i heard of eve going to it. but atm i find its just not worth it.would love to hear more about it!"
"ever thought about replacing your sound effects to make them sound ... better? what about warping, would you want to hear captain picard say, \"engage!\"? with this idea, you can! allowing players to mod sound effects opens the door for sound modding and sound packages which can boost eve quality immensely. these sounds won't effect anyone else, think of them as skins or sound packs for games like day of defeat, counterstrike or what have you.only the player using the mods will be able to hear/see the changes."
"i like it, but then again i'd also like the entire sound effects system to be overhauled and brought to date. i guess the reason why this has never seemed a pressing item for development has been the fact that most pvp'ers generally play with the sounds off - but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a decent sound system in place for people playing solo or missioning or whatnot."

"an answer from ccp would be nice yeah :)"
"considering how...well, controversial the issue appears to be for allot of people, i am surprised that such a modest number actually wants to know the answers, really am surprised. i guess, as i mentioned elsewhere, i still firmly believe that the provocateurs on both sides of the so-called \"t2 bpo\" issue are really afraid to ask the developers of the game real questions, because they are really afraid of the answers."
"i support the idea of getting a clear statement we all can work with. whether people are in agreement or not with the answer. we all can at least have an understanding."

"as i can't be arsed to dig through seven pages, i'm going to mention the perfect solution: don't queue, but stack skills, a lot of them to all you can momentarily train. so if you have 10 one-hour skills to train, you can train them simultaneously and do the next batch ten hours later. or come back after nine hours and finish one skill in six minutes.i'm still wondering why ccp needs to be forced to take a position in such matters."
"yes"
"i would like to have a queue as well."
"its an awful idea. i disagree 100%"
"ccp are only human too, errors may happen which may worry them (possible lawsuit, usual bull****). infact, you can almost guarantee with 100% certainty, errors will happen. what ccp have to do is decide whether the increase in subscription income is worth the unhappiness of \"some\" players. i personally feel they're just simply lazy, greedy or too afraid of possible consequences. there are alot of feasible solutions to this problem and they've decided to act on none of them (that i'm aware of). they've banned sellers and reversed some isk, but that's all it is, some. a minute fraction of what's actually being thrown about and stored by the companies. they need to act but i dont think they want to out of fear of possible mistakes which will backfire on them because lets face it, the majority of people would be ok with a mistake and an apology and rectification of the situation, but then there are always those few who try to use anything and everything available to themselves to enhance their own lives, even if by making others worse, along with the loss of subscription, probably makes the ceo of ccp poop himself thinking about banning isk farmers.as for farmers, they're a curse and a blessing, they're chopping prices of all ingame ships but making it more difficult for profiteering... blah blah blah, insert usual **** here.meh. i've given up on trying to convince people and ccp that farmers are bad.they're against the eula and i personally feel they're scum, i'm more than happy to crush their pods in an instant.// wrong account // wrathful hawk"
"original thread.at this moment, the thread is 11 pages long and still going.short versionproblems : the lack of alternative means of manufacturing anything in eve, combined with a much too perfectly working market and the good old human greed has completely denaturated the originally intended balance of prices for minerals (and therefore, potential income from mining depending on system security) and moon materials (therefore, causing dysp/prom moons to be worth shedloads and rest nearly worthless).and why would this be a problem ? because the risk and effort has to be balanced with reward proportionally.in the case of ore, the average-risk one has become worthless compared to the no-risk one, and the high-risk one is barly more profitable compared to the nearly no-risk one.in the case of moons, the effort and investment required to operate a certain moon as mining moon is nearly identical regardless of moon, yet the rewards range from a nearly complete loss for low-value moons (keeping in service only to offset fuel costs for sov purposes) to a disproportionately high profit (measured in billions monthly per moon, potentially ten billion in the near future).proposals - either one of the alternatives below or any combination of them from just one to all, in varying degrees could be acceptable :* slowly/constantly tweaking the blueprint/reaction inputs requirements so that they require less of the over-evaluated materials and more of the under-evaluated ones* adding alternative blueprints/reactions which use a lot more \"currently undervalued\" materials, with very little or even none of the \"currently overevaluated\" ones, which would output the same (or virtually identical) products* for moons, revamping extraction on a \"per concentration\" basis, with most (if not all) materials present in each and every moon, just with different rates of extraction* for minerals, a multitude of sub-solutions, ranging from a revamp of drone alloy drops (no more abundance of highends and lack of lowends), or rethinking ore make-up (in terms of refining yields) or even a total revamp of the mining system (all ore available everywhere, just with different concentrations - i.e. different extraction rates for various ores, depending on system security).the issue is not so much the fact that something needs to be done, but the fact that it needs to be done fast, because it's been \"badly broken\" for at least a year, and mildly broken for almost a year and a half.in other words, that this issue needs urgent attention, no matter what the chosen alternatives are (because there's plenty)."
"breaking news update !!! first csm representative support ___lame need to post again to express support to own issue : check___just to avoid a lot of confusioni do not care which exact \"solution\" or combination of possible solutions is getting picked.i only care about the csm (and therefore hopefully ccp too) acknowledging that we do have a problem, understanding why the problem exists, and picking a realistic solution.since the introduction of the drone regions and invention (the first triggers of the current crisis), nearly all subsequent changes ccp introduced related to these two separate (but similar) problems have made things worse, with a handfull of exceptions.the exceptions (the only good changes) were the removal of some megacyte and addition of some mexallon in one of the more valuable drone alloys fairly recently, and the \"revamp\" of decryptor bonuses and distribution method (which made invention slightly less wasteful, but still not decent enough to even come close to a me-researched bpo).if you agree this issue should be brought forth to ccp by the csm,don't forget to check the \"check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on\" box in your post!if your post doesn't show a please visit your user settings to re-enable images. under your name, you forgot to check it.it doesn't matter if you agree with any of the particular solutions listed in here.it just means you want the csm to talk about the issue and possible solutions to the devs at ccp."
"while modifying supply of roid minerals might be a good idea, modiying the use of moon minerals probably isn't.why? because moon minerals high price is good for promoting pvp. moons need to be valuable to support people wanting to take and hold them.the real problem is that supply will always be pegged to the highest demanded moon minerals. and the answer is to add more reactions. these reactions turn one moon mineral into another moon mineral at a certain rate.this means that you can lock the relative values of moons and as demand increases, less efficient moons become more productive to exploit.more moons of varying high values means more fighting over these moons.more fighting over these moons is good."
"this issue has been touched from several different directions over the course of the thread.right now, we have a guesstimated 200 dysprosium moons worth a bit over 6 bil a month, another guesstimated 200 promethium moons worth around 2.5 bil a month on the \"insanely valuable\" side of the spectrum.on the other side of the equally-rare spectrum, we have pretty much the same number of neodymium and thulium moons, which are barely worth around 100 mil each monthly.the higher the \"bottleneck\" materials go, the lower the rest go, until they can go down no longer, then overall t2 prices go up as dysp/prom keep going up too.kind of nasty...but if you balance the requirements of all \"equally rare\" materials, you make them all almost equally valuable... and as you add alternative means to obtain components, you correct the relative value of those components (depending how much more compared to base are needed)... while the overall demand keeps increasing (heck, actually, it increases a lot more early on after their introduction, since lower t2 prices due to more \"junk\" materials being used up to increase supply promote consumption, until a new balance point is reached, where overall demand is higher with relative moon material prices relatively balanced, no more almost-4-orders-of-magnitude differences)."

"no no no, atika, you get your butt handed to you in one thread and then you start the same one in a differnet location.come on, its your perception, you put it perfectly the world that is eve.... \"perfectly working market and the good old human greed\"free market with limited resource = monopoly and profit$$$$$it cost as much to deep mine tin, copper or lead as it does gold, commodity price is different, but cost is the same to produce, gold has more profit but there's a lot less available to mine, its easy to strip mine bauxite and iron ores, coal and tar sands, but different availabilities and prices .... get the picture..... so try to think of your all minerals and moon products in this way, it will take the strain off your brain. you could also think about oil from saudi arabia that costs 10$ to produce and oil in the north sea that costs 30$ to produce, same price on the world market, but one has high risk and low reward, thats an effect of the free market.there has to be supply limits, thats why zydrine is more expensive than trit, but they are also used in different ratios 10k trit, 250 zydrine, there is no under or over valued minerals, there is just supply availability, that sets the price and supply is set by players not ccp. alliances could dump huge amounts of high ends on the markets, but they don't want to, its not in thier interests is it, america doesn't go out handing out f-16's or high end cryptography to everyone do they, its not in thier interests.all ccp do is provide us with a real model to play with, any risk/reward is relative and not real world type, but what really governs eve for the vast majority is action taken/fun derived, you forget that infulence all the time even though its the driver behind new eden."
"your sorta missed the point and that's okay."
"wow, how convenient. how about applying the very same argument to the minerals in eve and see how your own analogy dictates that tritanium should be a lot cheaper than it is, and megagyte a lot more expensive.talk about shooting yourself in the foot. you're arguing exactly the same thing i'm arguing, but you are seemingly completely ignorant of the history and motives for the changes that have been happening in the past year, year and a half.and this precisely why ccp must intervene to fix what they have broken in the first place by altering the supply side for minerals, and the demand side for moon materials."
"seems like a kind of inefficient solution, to be honest. i think that there are better ways that this can be done, especially your other points.absolutely agreed.one suggestion i made on shc is to make moon materials dynamic, though at a very slow rate. as in, a material that is mined slowly gains a chance of being removed from moon and spawned at another unoccupied moon elsewhere (within the region or within a certain distance in lightyears). this would create different hotspots for alliances to fight over and makes it a bit harder for heavily entrenched alliances to hold onto high-value moons.i would be all for any of those solutions, though i the last part may be a bit difficult to implement.overall, definitely supported."
"linkageone possibility."
"recap of op;problems:a true free market is too unforgiving on the losers.only one bpo for a given end product, don't patents suck?mining income across the board is effected by martket forces (cos its a free market)op thinks null sec is riskier than highsec for miners, when one is open the other reserved for alliance members (different lvl's of competition) and concord don't make ship calls if attacked, and rats are bigger and scarier.why:because perceived higher risk by the op has a need by the op for greater reward. the low end mineral ores also are the most needed ores, so more ppl mine them.people mining high end mineral ores aren't able to squeeze a high enough price (only anknor is sole 0.0). reprocessing brings too much high end minerals on to market so killing drone swarms provide high income with low risk to a solo player.moon mining costs are the same as the same equipment is used to mine no matter what is collected, op thinks thats wrong.that the rarity value of a moon mineral has no inherent added value and those that control high end moon limit production supplies to others to make excess profits as its a free market system that allows them to abuse thier position of having the investment needed to mine those high end moons.proposals:all minerals to be created equal.all goods to have several bpo's of differing qualities of imput and output attributes.moon mining to be made all materials in one moon to make all materials equal.rewriting the mineral make up of drops and roids and linking them to sec status, so 1.0 give only 100% veldspar and 0.0 just gives 100% anknoor and sores changes to give multiple minerals (but that already exists) on a sliding scale, the same to be applied to moons all materials just variable % of them.op thinks its a issue as doesn't like a free market with all its abuses and changes in price, demand, availability, ownership and lots of stuff that effects the risk reward ratios and them and how they make isk.i think i get the gist of it."
"no.. your really don't. and i'm not going to bother trying to explain it either."
"cos you can't"
"no, because it has been explained, several times, in different ways, and yet you still stay true to your name."
"ah so it was you posting as an alt (kazzac elentria) up there!"
"ohh yes.. definately brainless this one is"
"and what about those who cant afford or have huge capital fleets at their disposal ?but yes reactions sound good, but would imbalance surely...."
"no i just don't get it, look all bpo's are freely available everywhere at npc and pos stations, minerals are available everywhere, science and industry lines are everywhere, so what is the gripe with \"the lack of alternative means of manufacturing anything in eve\" why?, you don't need one, there is lots of un used capacity, materials about, do you see that?price at the start of anything is never the eventual price, that is driven by market forces on raw material and production costs as well as demand and supply of the product, the same goes for original ratios. eve can never be linked to the stated base price and thier differentials as thats not a player driven game/market. the risk / reward ratio factors also have to change just because players interact and effect everything in the game, by our interaction we deviate from the base that ccp set, everything changes, thats the way the game was made to be imho, everything is player set, the lower the sec status the more so thats true.to stay within any set parameters makes this game static (may as well play civ or x), we pay to play a dymanic experience, that's effected by what players do no matter how much it pi$$es us off or how wrong we think it is."
"lack of alternative manufacture options means you can't use less tritanium in exchange for some other mineral to build a shuttle, a frigate or even a capital ship, no matter what else you're trying to use instead of tritanium.in other words, \"item a\" always gets manufactured from x units of tritanium, y units of pyerite, z units of mexallon and so on (assuming pe5 and perfect me blueprint, of course).what we propose would be to have an alternative blueprint for \"item a\" that would use up less tritanium but more pyerite, same count of mexallon and a bit of megacyte, for instance.and this is just one example of what i mean.prices of minerals which in turn are influenced by the insurance payout of ships and relative ease of availability of each individual mineral.minerals are usually needed in reverse ratios corresponding to their base prices, so if somehow all minerals would be equally easily available in terms of isk/hour spent gathering them, then the base price ratios would be maintained.but since highends are relatively much more abundant value-wise due to mission loot, drone alloy drops and higher base isk/hour income of 0.0 mining, yet lowends (especially tritanium) no longer have a reliable alternative cheap source, the pressure of \"i want to earn as much as possible\" drives tritanium prices up a lot more, relatively speaking, as the highends are driven down.as a result, due to the way ore value was initially spread, lowsec ore becomes nearly worthless, and 0.0 ore decreases strongly in value compared to intended initial value... but at the same time, veldspar (and other tritanium-rich ores that also contain traces of the minerals least affected by this) become insanely more valuable compared to the intended base value, throwing the entire mining revenue out of whack.everything is not player set. it's only in your imagination where it appears to be so. yes, you do the leg work allright, yes, you may profit from various fluctuations every now and then, yes, for a while, you can influence the market and so on and so forth.but the long-term, wide-area averages are completely set in stone the moment changes to the static data are made. and nobody but ccp can change that data. the only thing you can do is adapt to the new status quo faster.one can partially predict the equilibrium prices whenever a change is made by ccp, but one can totally and easily predict the direction of changes whenever ccp changes one thing. the only remotely questionable thing is just how strong the deviation will be, not the direction."

"umm can i substitue rubber for eggs when i make you that omelette. /sarcasm look i understand your argument but it's just loading the database with more crap for limited utility in the game, mineral composition of an item as long as minerals are in plentiful supply (even if not acquired) poses no problem it is only a player perception of under or over supply. as a side note i think a shuttle made out of zydrine would get poped just because its made out of zydrine for fun, do different races ships of the same class get made from the same material requirements atm, i've never looked, you have, do they? there is no real need for player made alternative goods we have the meta lvl tech 1 drops from npc's (the bpo's of which would be a good way to implement your idea though), there are more than enough mission runners to manufacture them to fill demand with their guns etc..yes price is dependent on availability and regulation, veldspar being driven up in price (in relative terms) just means not enough people are giving chribba competition (probally out of respect) for veldspar roids, miners can mine anything, if more profit is in veldspar mine it, if your null sec alliance needs high ends then buy it in, don't mine it, have your miners strip high sec veldspar for profits while they can as the market will change to reflect the fact that your not mining high ends but lots of high sec low ends or go farm drones. there are ways to mitigate if you think about it without changing basic minerals and goods mineral compositition, if you can't do an action because your risk is to high in that system/constellation/region, you have the power to change it if you want it enough.i see nothing wrong with ores being worthless, thats the free market at work, if farming drones gives better profits, farm drones, if veldspar mining prints isk do it, less risk more reward is better for profits isn't it. that the mechanics are not as you want to preceive does not mean its broken or the sky is going to fall on us, risk reward is also market forces at work, if you can't profit do something different, if you don't think you earn enough do something different, if you think the risk is to high for the reward do something that fulfills your critera, someone will fill your niche quickly enough.ccp code in minerals and moon materials (static data), they require us to mine them and we don't mine more than 20% of them so thats not an argument that holds water. drops from drones and npc's are limited by numbers of missions that can be run, hours spent ratting etc both of which fluxiates daily according to players desires, a random generator to provide the drops, again ccp don't set a limit in stone."

"no insurance for concord kills (which is really what he proposes) is fine."
"suicide ganking isn't possible, if the people piloting their ships aren't dumb. i mean, seriously, warp to zero and align in less than ohhh. 10 seconds.it takes me .5 seconds to lock + 2 seconds lag, plus 2.5 seconds to scan your cargo / your fittings then another 2 to 5 seconds to make a call. then my mate takes another 2 seconds to lock you and then scram / blow you away. if your hauler doesn't take, oh 20 seconds to align and warp you are probably fine. however, if you are afk autopiloting. i mean, its your own damn fault if you are auto-piloting in a hauler filled with minerals through high sec, or in a shuttle filled with capital skills and implants."
"if your partner isn't scanning in the system before, you're doing it wrong. that reasoning is pretty artificial.support some kind of insurance penalty, even if is minor such as adding +1% of cost per full minus one sec rating (so maxes out at 43% cost). also advocate the doubling of sec loss per attack/kill/podding, it's absurd you can kill over a dozen people before forced out of high-sec."
"i support this, it doesn't make sense that the insurance company should pay you when concord shoots you down since it's effectively 100 % chance that your ship is doomed when they show up so and insurance is supposed to protect people from accidents etc. not when they choose to deliberately loose their ship, also destroying your own ship should be considered insurance fraud just like irl.the insurance companies in eve are total suckers since they have no rules at all except that you can't repackage the item."
"increasing the cost for sec hits kind of hurts that anti-pirates in the game. they get a sec hit when attacking a pirate in lo-sec with a rating higher than the -5.0 level (ie -4.9 to +5.0). and it hits the pirates that do not high sec suicide gank. so penalizing folks that have nothing really to do with suicide ganking.maybe if you get popped by concord you receive a special multiplier from the insurance agency that increases the cost of insuring future ships."

"it's pretty rare that only one side lags, with the exception of attackers when warping to a grid loaded with defending ships. the same applies to defenders warping to a grid loaded with attacking ships, however.this is a terrible solution, honestly. it favors the defenders and penalizes the attackers. this means that any defender, to make a system completely invulnerable to attack, just needs to put as many of their people (read: alts) in the system and then go afk. it would take so long for a sizable attack force to jump in it would be impossible to organize. changing this by alliance will mean that people will get around it by forming alt alliances.lag, in it's current form, penalizes all sides relatively equally and there isn't much one side can do to take advantage of lag (and if there is you can be sure that ccp is going to remove that ability). any solution to lag must not penalize the attackers or the defenders.who claimed that?"
"bumped and /signed. they will also hand out much more costumer satisfaction, or, at the very least, not create as much costumer frustration.additionally, we should ask them to hire more developers dedicated to bug hunting and fixing, i.e. maintainance. bit rot and bug probability increase exponentially over time if not cared about, so it should also be in ccp's interest to address things before utter hell arrives. having known bugs hang around for years doesn't reflect well on software and their developers."
"not supported."
"another terrible idea."
"i think the investment, both in time and isk, that alliances can put into 0.0 systems should be more in depth, but this doesn't accomplish that.if you leave hangars accessible, all you're doing is basically adding another service to be blown up, with a huge graphical overhead."
"you don't understand 0.0, and this idea shows it. a defending alliance could never destroy its own outpost as a scorched earth strategy because if you're destroying the outpost because you're losing the system the second you drop your sov claim you're losing the system and the outpost to the attackers, who will of course stop the countdown. the new owners of the station sure as hell aren't going to self-destruct it. why, when all the defender's goods that weren't evacuated are now stuck in their station? destroying the station would deny them a staging ground and make it possible for their enemy to get their assets out.if i'm wrong, go ahead and tell me in which situations where an alliance holding an outpost could and would destroy it?"
"it would be interesting."
"at first glance this might seem like a good idea but if you think about it for more than a minute it's a horrible idea."
"i think it's a terrible idea in almost any possible way it could be implemented. the impact of destroying an outpost is so significant that you would need to implement massive defensive advantages. right now the sov system in 0.0 is such that big alliances like bob, goons, etc., can blob the crap out of any hostiles, while doing the same on the offensive. since i don't think jade has anywhere near the ability to balance such a process, i don't support this at all."
"actually, let's take this concept to its logical extreme, and allow the destruction of stations everywhere. i mean, if it's a good idea for 0.0 it must be a good idea for empire as well, right?"
"wait. this is the \"remove jade from the chair\" issue thread right?ok, just checking."
"agreed entirely tharrn."
"yet its got more than twice the support of your \"big thread\" about destructible stations."
"csm has just begun. the first board must be the strongest as it is their task to make mistakes, discover these mistakes and then put in tools to correct these mistakes.the only thing i would request is to please not get bogged down in creating extra processes. i already see the red tape piling up fast."
"there's nothing to bog down anymore when all jade has to do is schedule meetings outside of us availability and bring in alternates for everything.edit: ...and he didn't even do that. a quorum of 7 is not a quorum of 9 as the csm document states is needed.inappropriate comment.applebabe"
"nope they didn't vote for me so i don't have to listen la la laso you admit to scheduling a meeting at a time when you knew three council members could not make it as an attempt at making yourself look better. why you think it's important to neglect the ideas of the largest alliance in the game is beyond me."
"this gets better and better. or worse, really."
"it's hardly anyone fault, but of the affected csm representatives if they live in some exotic timezone, that doesn't allow them to fulfill their duty as members of the csm. they should have been aware of this problem when they decided to run for csm.why should the vast majority make concessions for two people who choose to live somewhere in the wilds, far off from the cradle of civilization. thinking about it, since when are the inhabitants of the \"colonies\" allowed to vote on anything anyway? their presumptuousness is really disgusting and they should be put back into their place, tbqph."
"im not going to pretend i read this thread, and im not going to support or oppose this thread at this time since i havent read this thread. what i do know is that on a quick skim through this proposal recieved 96 (ish, give or take a few it being late) whilst other threads you have approved for discussion have recieved fewer than 20, and have been much less trolled by you jade (helpful csm icon lets me see when csm members post), and most notably:"
"i support.being a chairman or leader of any sorts will get you a lot of negative attention and critism (people thinking they can do better and stuff).but this chairman is supporting proposions that barely have any votes.the chair should look at the amount of votes in a thread before giving or declining support to that proposition.a chairman representing people should never ever support something that no or almost nobody supports or agrees on. and should also never follow their own agenda. if this person does do this, they should be taken away from their function.do i think i can do better, yes."
"jade will respond that this is what he has been doing god leave him alone stop trolling you trollunfortunately, this thread is about removing jade constantine from the council, not asking for ccp to give the council permission to vote to remove him from the council without the repercussions of getting removed from the council altogether, as it states in the csm document.unfortunately, since it's not possible to get anywhere near 5% of the eve population to post on these threads, that won't happen. instead, the csm members get to present their own pet projects to ccp. democracy in action!"
"negative. basically its part of our job to ignore nonsense posts. 200 supports on a nonsense issue are worth less than 1 support on a good issue. sorry to disappoint you but threadnaughts simply mean nothing when you bring a little bit of good analysis to the table. thats why no post like this will be advocated in good faith by a csm delegate. a) it brings nothing to the game, and b) it would be embarrassing the csm delegate to bring such a motion and have it voted down on the public record wasting time better alloted for decent issues."
"i think if i were a megalomaniac who had gone off the reservation, i would call any motion to bring me back to reality 'nonsense' too. that doesn't make it true.it wouldn't be any more \"embarrassing\" then your posts here. in fact, the only way to recover the good faith of the playerbase is to support this particular issue."
"same here. that thread was creepy."
"this thread seems to be brought in a well ordered manner, for example unlike the monster truck thread each comment *seemed* to have criticism attatched, promoting the debate. just because something is aimed at you doesnt make it nonesense, and if it was nonesense then you would have surely posted once at the start saying \"this is nonesense and not worthy of csm time\" and ignored the thread from then on? replying continuously to thread you deem as \"nonsense\" and thus dismiss from the agenda whilst debating with people seems kinda contradictory in terms, if it was nonsense it wouldnt be worthy of your time. on the other hand if it is a concern about the csm chairman which is worth the time of a csm rep in the frequence you respond then should it not be brought before the council as a popular concern?/me shrugs, just seems odd to ignore a thread directed at you with large contructive critism and debate rather than to admit it is a valid concern then to just say \"ill bring it up at the meeting, and see what the general consensus of the council is. if your right and i have no support ill step down and well elect a new chairman, if not then you can all stfu\". by ignoring concerns with popular support and promoting threads with no support that you like then you just add fuel to the fire and give ammo to the people posting on this thread, and people of a similar mentality. its your choice really, but your just making things worse by yourself by responding."
"we've learned that lesson really, administrative guff is going to the end of the agenda. we'll be concentrating primarily on good issues and doing our best to ignore the silly stuff from this point forward."
"and you are the one that decides what constitutes a \"good issue\" of course. how convenient. could you quote the appropriate logs where this vote was held?this is why you must be stopped."
"how many players need to support this until ccp decides to step in? this is getting ridiculous."
"i'm pretty sure bane and glorius have advocated a vote of no confidence. the rest of the council might, but they've been so antagonized by you that they've probably capitulated. it would be nice if you guys would just work with each other, like during the second meeting."
"i hear you sister, you're absolutely right. it's a shame how long ccp tolerated this abomination that flies under the 'goonswarm' ticker. time for ccp to step in and swing the banhammer."
"by the current rules you need 5% of the player base. thats around 11,000 supports. 10,900 to go. (it should be possible though maitsu. you have 5000 people in goonswarm and each of these can support 3 times by abusing their alts). so you could actually manage 15,000 if you market the issue effectively internally. get going is my advice! either that or convince a rep to bring it up on the agenda. (of course once it gets on the agenda you still need to win 5/9 csm votes to get it raised to the csm/ccp conference and ccp need to approve it). + at some point you'll actually need some arguments rather than smack and nonsense. and comparing the csm chair making a moderation decision to a genocidal dictator nuking half the world is probably not going to do it for you"
"why does the csm even need an authority figure other than to decide when the meetings will be held? it's 9 guys/girls discussing a video game, not congress, the un or something like that."
"it wasn't supposed to be like this. jade just decided to grant itself power."
"good thing we don't need to worry about all that, since goonswarm has two reps in it. maybe if they were actually in thursday's meeting, you all wouldn't have wasted ten minutes on word processors. where's the moderation? can't you show a little neutrality, or did you have to mute yourself so you didn't appear like an ass?"
"i fully support the impeachment of jade constantine."
"all i need to do is put the thumbs up here correct? this is my first time participating in such a wonderful democratic process. i like the idea that we can get rid of a csm for failing at their job particularly one who sees fit to prevent open discourse by muting other csm."
"signed"
"i fully support stfu and get back to work."
"two more and we'll hit 100. \o/"
"then better hurry up and make some more alts."
"i only have 97 alts."
"showing support for this topic, jade is an embarrassment."
"number 100 \0/seriously though, jade needs to get a clueoh and page 12 snypa"
"o ya"
"i can get behind this"
"this is democracy not a jadeocracy."
"i like peaches."
"i'll accept you throwing away obvious parody threads - if monster trucks got 10999 votes, it still shouldn't see the light of day. but this isn't an obvious parody, it's a serious request, and it's being taken seriously by most of the voters. but then, maybe my gordon brown analogy in the other thread was apt after all. the treaty of lisbon doesn't need a vote, after all - we've seen what can happen when voters get a chance to say \"no\" to their betters"
"yes. in on this."
"you know, if it wasn't for you voting, in this very meeting, for the possibility of the council electing someone else instead of you i would consider seconding this motion. they don't seem to hate you enough to actually do it, though.that log makes for some good lulz."
"if anything, this thread proves we -need- voting against a proposition. i'm sure jade has quite a few supporters who are frustrated they can't outvote the goons here.fly well and have fun,grismar."
"didn't see serenity either so guess that was a quorum of 6.but that meeting went way smoother.so next step would be a smooth meeting with all 9 members.and to the goons. tone down and wait how things pan out for a few meetings since csm actually might have taken the clue not to slip up again."
"supported, this is not the effective way to run a meeting."
"chairperson is not an emperor."
"can this self-important drama queen."
"remove jade!"
"oh, so you didn't read the notes and decided to come post here.... that's fine, i went ahead and read the log for you. see, if you had read it you'd see that it called up an alternate for serenity being absent, but it convienantly neglected to call on alternates for bane or darius.so, a 9 member quorum, with 3 members absent and one alternate called in means we have a quorum of....7."
"goon teaching me math?oh noes, the sky is falling!i did read. before my 1st cup of java that is.my bad. please except my most humble apologies.and you're right. the 2 representatives missing part could use some moar explanation.btw i still think goons should tone down a bit. even though they don't like jade its the voters who make it he deserves a decent chance of making this work. (and i sure am not one of them btw)"
"yeah, except that the csm document specifies that 7 is the quorum. they prefer 9, but 7 is sufficient."
"fortunately we had a ruling from ccp! yay. and since the meeting was publicized and everyone was invited, both from the public forum thread and the in-game channel. and we managed to get a combination of 6 reps and 1 alternate we had a valid meeting."
"so the meeting of 7 euros was approved by ccp standards. but what about the 2 us ones? will there be meetings of 7 all the time?i'm just asking since this might goons worked up a bit which i think isn't all too strange.also could be some private stuff we don't have to know. anywayz....."
"on the whole i'll try to pick meeting times that the majority of csm reps can commit to attending without too many problems. weekends are probably the best for this. but its worth everyone calming down a bit and realizing that there are going to be alot of meetings in this session and its not disastrous if people miss couple here and there. everyone goes on holiday and sometimes things come up. i'm certainly going to miss some and serenity will be filling in as vice chair. its very good that we can count meetings with 7 reps valid otherwise we would have some real problems in the long term.there's nothing \"private\" about this - we had a deadline and needed to vote on some multi item issues otherwise they coudn't get on the iceland conference agenda."
"hear, hear."
"hearing."
"see: meeting #2. this has already been accomplished. the ongoing drama were a direct result of actions taken, not of an inability for people to get along."
"which obviously was both too important to have all members present for, and not important enough for you to extend any timezone courtesies to the us representatives who clearly would have been at work at the time."
"i beg to differ. anyway i agree jade was involved in several welp moments. but the way some others reacted wasn't top notch either. guess what, people frack up sometimes.for the sake of it lets assume jade learned something useful. and i do hope the next meeting will include all members.you don't have to like or even trust each other. as long if you work through the agenda and do your work its ok.just remember that there are many people watching over your shoulders."
"i don't disagree with that. people are people and screw up sometimes. meeting #2 was well organized and expedient and 3 was a fiasco. from what i've read last night's meeting went back to the organized kind and i'll be happy to be a part of any meeting of the sort where people are able to speak their minds on the issues at hand and participate."
"obligatory jade-hate comment: this post now has twice the support of jade's destructible outposts idea and his alliance-mate's 0.0 sovereignty redesign combined.real thoughts: let's wait for the next meeting flip-out before passing judgment. as much as i may dislike jade, everyone deserves at least one f-up. now jade knows what the voters expect him to act like, so if he screws up again, it's not for lack of knowing what we expect. then we can vote to get rid of him."
"intolerable."
"wow, i didn't expect this when i voted for jade, he doesn't desrve a second chance, which, he clearly forfeited with the replies in this thread. he is a child that tries to ignore anything he doesn't like."
"if you would bother to read the thread you would seea) it's not just goons that want to oust jadeb) there are far more people posting in support than there are posting against it anyway"
"hearing jade say the chairman should step down and hold a vote among the council and then watching him retain the position after this was just too shifty in my opinion.at the same time, we need to have the csm actually tackling issues. it's obvious there is contention between jade and members of the council therefore it would be due diligence to step down and hold a vote so that the valuable work the csm can accomplish can be just that, accomplished. if jade is re-elected, then 100%: go with it. if not, then hopefully the next chairman can hold the thing together."
"it has become clear that jade constantine has no intention to use his position as chair to do anything other than further his self-delusions of grandeur.i think the csm is an important step in bringing player feedback to ccp and i don't want to see it ruined. support"
"no brainer here, since jade simply made up all these powers the chair has in order to steal control of the council"
"i won't say jade should be removed, but i will admit that i am a little nervous about his being lead csm after reading some valid posts regarding his past."
"yup jade needs to go home"
"yeah, jade needs to go."
"i have to agree with everyone else on this matter, even the talk in my npc corp chat is one of shock and anger. this little napoleon needs to have nothing to do with eve."
"i agree."
"agreed."
"supporting dis"
"jade is doing a good job, and so is the rest of the csm judging by that last meeting, some confusion, friction etc was bound to happen in the start.and if jade gets removed by this thread, wouldn't that kinda, invalidate the election? not too familiar with the finer workings of politics, but voting time is where the peons get to voice their opinion?from the op1. calls upon the csm to undertake an immediate vote for the removal of jade constantine from chair;can the csm do that?"
"to the rionnag alba guys above. if you know anything about cva then you would know that it is not a lack of blue slots which is the problem - but the lack of red ones our policy is that everyone in providence is neutral - unless they have been set red for piracy or terroristic actions. we therefore do not need blue slots.the cva is probably the most 'nap-less' alliance in 0.0. apart from our holders, sylph and iac we are pretty much red to the entire universe including bob, -a-, tcf, goons, red alliance and the majority of the northern alliances.this issue is not about 'napfests' it is about giving alliance adminstrators proper ability and options to manage their diplomatic relations. the current system was appropriate when it was first implemented but since then the number of coorporations and alliances that need to be 'tracked' has mushroomed exponentially and it is time standing slots reflected this.do you really think that nrds as a system should be ruled out as a genuine 'playstyle' and option for space holding alliances simply because they don't have the standings slots to properly managed their 'reds'?this change is a small tweak which requires little to no 'programming' effort on the part of ccp and provides alliance adminstrators around the galaxy with a lot more flexibility in managing how they interact with other corporations and alliances.the current standing slot limit appears to be arbitrary and if ccp are reluctant to make what appears to be a commonsense change then i would certainly like to know their reasoning why. it's possible that they have a very good reason which they just haven't told us yet"
"this.also:maybe make it so that you can have more red slots, make red/blue slots separate."
"@ hardin:give alliances 5 blue slots to other alliance, 5 to separate corps and infinite reds or so then..*numbers arbitrary, but should be low for blues."
"seems like a reasonable suggestion to me - but as i not someone responsible for managing standings slots - would be interested in getting some further input into this as i am not sure what consequences your proposal could have.i have put this on the agenda for sunday meeting and need to create an issue template by then - so happy if people want to feed more views into this..."
"i am trying to keep this issue as simple as possible. my own belief is against hundreds of blues, but that is my game play. if some group wants hundreds of blues that is their business. we should not hard code against legitimate play styles (even if we personally disagree). you cannot force people to fight with each other.this proposal advocates an increase in the hard limits placed on corporations. a larger standings pool means more possibilities. possibilities are good!"
"you clearly missed the point. your saying that you used drake because its missile yet use myr vs astarte which is drone vs turret comparison. the fact that the myr has more pg that its tier 1 turret ship just emphasises how good tier 2 bc's are. your taking 1 stat to compare the ships and ignoring the rest, like slots differences and drake has lower cpu to the nh.but hay, compare one set of numbers to whatever rules you like to draw a conclusion. well i'm not suprised with the numerous fitting mod setups being posted here. also depends a lot on if you expect the nh to fit tackle and how many damage mods you expect abso to fit. personally 2 on each which gives:1. a single mar on a abso should do <250 ehp/s with resistance gang link, thats using cap meaning have to have a cap booster.2. a passive tanked nh should do <325 ehp/s at peak with resistance gang link, thats before overloading invulns. so while not constant its a good chunk of your hp band, at lest 20% to 50% for no cost.but like i said i'm not against it, just prefer proper discussion instead of \"i'm posting this single stat comparison so must agree!!!\" or \"this ships setup should be equal to that ship\". a lot of ships need tweaking, usually the question is how and how much. i mean the astarte has to drop a bonused weapon to fit a gang link, would giving the nh another missile point that uses less fitting than gang link be a good plus? personally i'd only give the nh a small increase, nothing like the drakes pg or the 164pg in one of the early posts.omg! he pawned me ... sure by missing the point about looking at one stat to draw conclusions isn't great nevermind against other ships in another class thats are only vaguely similar.i'm talking about one of the early posts where it was:1) must have active tank.2) must have biggest weapons.because that clearly hurts the nh most with its lower pg making pds/rcu's percentage increase have less effect.the best setup for a nh is passive tank in my eyes, be it comparing against hp, dual rep or mix hp+rep tank. hence that style of x can fit these so y should comparison is useless...there's so many things to compare past ehp, ehp/s, speed and dps. for instance the damage lost through range and tracking/sig/speed varies, i'd say nh loses the least damage compared to other cs, so while having the least raw dps the gap is closed in many situations where tracking/range hurts the drone/turret cs a lot more."
"1. the comparison between myrm and astarte is irrelevant. drake vs. nighthawk (and onyx vs. nighthawk) are the comparisons most illuminating. frankly, i'm not sure what your point is here.2. i assume no tackle on the nighthawk - it just doesn't have the midslots. mwd is mandatory, of course. the quoted numbers i gave for abso were for a spread of 0-2 damage mods. 1 damage mod allows dc ii, 2x eanm ii, thermic ii, 2x mar ii, giving a single mar tank of 270 dps.nighthawk, like all shield tankers, should always fit 3 damage mods when possible - the reduced flexibility of shield tanking is balanced by increased ease of fitting damage mods. your tank figure of 325 dps for the nh is flat wrong, i have no idea how you got it. it is 200 dps with the standard buffer tank, disregarding gang mod. oh wait a second, are you using a pve fit? take off the sprs, please. passive-regen tanking is too slot- and cap-intensive to be of any real use in pvp. the rest of your post is vague and meandering. the \"proper discussion\" has been done to death in this thread, and in the one linked in the op. i have spent a long time explaining the fitting mods required on comparable fits (hence the highest-pg short-range weapon fits etc.) of the field cs, and showing that the nh needs so many more than the other field cs. i invite you to either explain why you think the nighthawk is currently balanced with the other field cs, or to suggest a suitable pg boost figure yourself. a quick look here, for example, might be helpful.also, this pg comparison is relevant. please explain why you think these figures are correct, or suggest changes yourself.drake: 7 launchers, 850 pgonyx: 5 launchers, 835 pgnighthawk, 6 launchers and gang mod, 710 pg.interestingly, the 140 pg suggested after the extensive modelling is exactly the same as the difference between the pgs of the current nh and the drake.note - i appreciate that the t1 battlecruisers have a role bonus for gang mods also. however, fitting a gang mod on any of them is tricky, and the drake is therefore balanced in this respect. however, the field cs fit gang mods without too much trouble - well, all but the nighthawk, which is therefore not balanced, and deserves a pg boost.other note: regarding the linked modelled fits, all of them use an active tank, despite buffer tanking being generally superior in pvp, because fitting an active tank is a perfectly viable option for the other field cs; hence, it should be similarly viable for the nighthawk. buffer tanking, whether shield buffer or armour, is less pg-intensive; hence we must examine the ease of fitting f active tanks to properly gauge this aspect of balance."
"1. my point is just because x ship has more of y than z ship doesn't mean it should apply to all ship vs ship comparisons, if every other stat is identical then sure but they arn't like that.2. i'm happy with 2 damage mods, as long as its a dc and then pds taking the lows and not rcu/cpu. my abso setup is mar, 1600, dc t2, 2x eanm t2, therm res rig and hp rig (clone has 3% cpu implant for the full setup). the < 250 number comes from that plus resistance rig with mindlink although rep rig would improve the ehp/s.depends what your standard buffer tank is and depending if your using pds/dc in spare lows and not cpu/rcu mods, also depends on rigs. pvp setup: named lse, 2x inv, photon, 2 hp rigs with resistance gang link and 3 pds gives < 325 ehp/s. i would prefer dc instead of one of the pds and a t2 lse, thats about it that needs improving. the pds add both hp and recharge so while i consider it a hp tank the passive recharge is a added bonus that practically equals a single mar while not only no cap use but the pds have increased the amount and recharge.firstly the nh gets no extra bonus to gang links over a drake so really should be compared with both without or both with a gang link. drake with gang link has both cpu and pg problems. without gang link the heavy missile drake typically (for me) runs into cpu problems before pg (with mwd, no tackle fit). it also has a extra mid slot that will really have to be a lse since more than 3 hardeners gets a bit dodgy. basically for me drake is limited by cpu, nh by pg hence the reasoning that the pg should be the same or there abouts doesn't stand up.of course 2 of the other cs are limited to active tanking or the benifit of passive tanking must outweigh the ignoring of there bonus.as far as suggestions. i'd prefer to have a 7th launcher slot and off the top of my head around 50 more pg. adds more variation and allows the fitting of something like:2x pds t2, dc t2, 2x bcs t2.mwd, t2 lse, 2x inv t2, photon t2.6x hm t2, gang link.fitting a 7th launcher instead of gang link saves fitting so can then add a 3rd bcs with the 7th launcher for a better damage fit (but less tank cos no gang link.so rather than more variation of \"sleipnir can fit xl booster tank so nh should\" as a variation i'd prefer a small easing of the fitting and more choice with the high slots.p.s. meant discussion of ideas rather than \"it needs x amount of pg discussion\". i understand the pg discussion is more to get a value but its the end setups/performance i'd value more than comparisons to other ships."
"once again gypsio ironed out all your misunderstandings, so i'm not going to bother readdressing them.i will offer you one challenge though (which i am more than happy to see anyone answer), to see why you are so afraid to have the nighthawk given a little love - - take our theoretical nighthawk with 850 base grid and put some horrifyingly unfair setup on it that would clearly demonstrate why giving the nighthawk 140 more grid would make it so much better than the other field commands.(i've asked anyone to provide this bit of info in this thread and the other, and not a single person has yet to answer.)"
"uhhh, your above setup requires - 1061.75 of 978.47 powergrid. even with your adding a fictional 50 powergrid the nighthawk still falls short on grid. so what on earth would be the point of adding a 7th launcher slot??!?!!seriously though, these setups and arguments are actually fanatastic illustrations of how completely gimped the nighthawk's powergrid is when compared to other field commands. people come in here, and without really thinking about it, post some off-the-top off their head setup that seems to be perfectly reasonable for the nighthawk to fit, and lo and behold... it doesn't even fit!look at the above setup. the nighthawk can't even freaking fit its lowest grid (lowest dps) weapons, a single lse buffer, and a command module while using two t2 pdus and being given a fictional +50 powergrid.hello?! golly gee, does the nighthawk have a powergrid issue?! i wonder."
"signing because nighthawk fixing makes me happy in the pants."

"my god could you be anymore of a \"if it isn't my idea i'm trolling you\" prat?!?firstly i said around 50. secondly i didn't say t2 mwd (rather have lower cap use named).thirdly you fail at maths. 50 * 1.25 (eng 5) * 1.05 * 1.05 (two t2 pds) = 68.9 pg. so the actual total is 1045.75 / 1047.37.forthly where did i mention adding a high slot and launcher slot? i'm talking about following astarte style of being able to fit all your highs as bonused weapon. hams and heavies have less fitting costs than a gang link hence saves you fitting.give tempest 1000 more pg and show me a overpowered setup, just because you can change something doesn't mean you should. the sleipnir's cpu is horribly gimped, its got to active tank to take advantage of its bonus and has to use named xl booster, large (lmao rubbish fit) or fit a cpu mod. see how easy it is to pick one stat and say it can't fit what someone else can and call for it to be increased?but hay just because i don't agree on the amount/method of improving go ahead and troll about everyone \"pawning\" me .seriously, you talk about people not thinking then post this rubbish, not worth my time responding to you, will save my time and respond to people who can actually discuss (like gypsio) without being a prat."
"turning to an ad hominem since you are entirely wrong. again.um, ok. so what is it? 60? 40?i knew this was coming. adding a named doesn't make your medicore setup fit. once again you've offered a poorly setup nighthawk that doesn't have enough grid to it all.mila's impossible nighthawk setup -ballistic control system iiballistic control system iiballistic control system iipower diagnostic system iipower diagnostic system iiy-t8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivelarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iiphoton scattering field iiheavy missile launcher iiheavy missile launcher iiheavy missile launcher iiheavy missile launcher iiheavy missile launcher iiheavy missile launcher iisiege warfare link[empty rig slot][empty rig slot]this pathetic setup requires 1046.75. however your nighthawk has 978.47. to assist you with your sub-par grade school math skills that is a difference of 68.28. since you said 'around 50' (which apparently is up to your whim to change at any moment in order to cover your failing argument) i assumed that was not a base adjustment.nice backpeddling and use of vague definitions in order to cover for holes in your argument. your pathetic nighthawk setup above leaves 0.7 grid while requiring two powergrid fitting mods. all the while other field commands can fit similar (and far more effective setups) with no powergrid fitting mods.so, in conclusion you have -a. admitted that the nighthawk does indeed need a powergrid increase.b. shown that you will post fits that actually don't fit, and then will backpeddle and change figures once you are called on it.c. the fits you do post are awful, since it's all the nighthawk can manage on its pathetic grid.my challenge (which you conveniently ignored) still stands. take a theoretical nighthawk with 850 base grid and post setups that show that such a ship will be unbalanced.thanks. i'll be waiting for that."
"convient way to ignore my challenge. this thread isn't about a tempest, in case you haven't noticed, genius. my challenge stands. take a theoretical nighthawk with a base grid of 850 and post some setups showing it's unbalanced. what kind of fool are you? while the sleip does indeed 'have' to active tank to make use of its bonus, it can passive tank very, very well. hell, the nighthawk throws away its missile precision bonus all the time, since it is utterly useless. also, a passive tank on a sleip is in some ways more advantageous than on a nighthawk, as the sleip is far faster and more agile, meaning it can reduce the damage it takes and keep range.a. if fitting only an active large shield booster is a 'lmao rubbish fit' then you have just admitted that any active setup for the nighthawk is rubbish, as that is the largest active tank it can fit!! the sleip has the luxury of being able to squeeze on a named xl shield booster. do me a favor a show me a setup where the nighthawk can squeeze on an xl shield booster?b. the sleip has loads of cpu, thanks to low cpu weapons, einstein. look at this setup -gyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iidamage control ii[empty low slot]ballistic deflection field iiinvulnerability field iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender ii10mn microwarpdrive ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon iiwarfare link[empty rig slot][empty rig slot]this setup takes only 531.25 of 593.75 cpu and 1588.7 of 1825 grid. it also leaves one low slot free for whatever you want to fit. seriously, some of these comments and arguments you make are textbook delusional.apparently i struck a nerve as you keep bringing this up. your salty tears are delicious.the only difference between gypsio and myself in our postings is that he is patient... and tolerant of the profoundly stupid, where i have no compunction in helping you look like the fool that you are, which your stream of delusional and misinformed posts perfectly illustrates."
"i call shenanigans on this bunk.with a full rack of hml iis the nh has 446.25 cpu left.with a full rack of 425 iis the sleipnir has 462.5 cpu left.the nh actually has less cpu than the sleip, since they both shield tank."
"signed."
"that's only half the truth. add in three weapon upgrades for each ship -nighthawk -t2 heavy missile launcher x6t2 bcus x3- requires 367.5 cpu / 570 pg- remaining cpu - 326.25- remaining pg - 317.5sleipnir -t2 425s x7t2 gyros x 3- requires 221.25 cpu / 973.2 pg- remaining cpu - 372.5- remaining pg - 851.8both of these ships shield tank, both fit command modules (or use a last high slot). however -look at how totally and completely gimped the nighthawk is when compared to the sleipnir, despite it using the rest of its slots almost identically. the sleip has a bit more cpu than the nighthawk, and more than double the grid.hello?!? mila says the sleip's cpu is 'horribly gimped'. what?! anyone with a brain look at the comparison above and tell me what the very obvious problem might be."
"i was just using the arguement used for the nh of comparing a fit (active) against another ship then complaining about the fitting constraint i hit first.xl booster is the hardest thing to fit unless you ignore the bonus. so the performance of the none-active slipnir is limited by no tanking bonus and performance of active nh setup is limited by fitting and not the bonus.so while the nh weapons use more cpu the main cpu use is in the mid slots.edit: stupid pc, hit post by accident.of course i could start using stupid comparisons with artillery setups that can hit at the range heavy missiles can but thats not why i posted that paragraph. was just to demonstrate how the difference in setup constraints changes from ship to ship hence i prefer the actual performance discussion rather than comparison of what others \"can\" fit.i'm not against the suggestion, just prefer to look at other methods of improving it as i suggested rather than just throw x pg at it so it can fit whatever."
"umm, no you weren't. your statement was 'the sleipnir's cpu is horribly gimped'. you're wrong. more backpeddling from you.that's true. the nighthawk has a very slight advantage while passive tanking since it has a bonus to passive and active tanking. however, the sleipnir passive tanks nearly as well as the nighthawk despite its ignored bonus, all the while it is doing far more dps, has a much higher top speed, and has more flexibility with its slot layout since it doesn't have to fill its lows with powergrid mods. in active tanking mode the sleipnir embarrasses the nighthawk in every way.so, either way, the sleipnir comes out ahead, despite your ignorant comment that its 'cpu is horribly gimped'.true, and the mids used for shield tanking require lots of grid also. the sleipnir has both more cpu and far more grid available than the nighthawk, which i showed above, thanks to eleneth posting his partial-truth comparison.nighthawk -t2 heavy missile launcher x6t2 bcus x3- requires 367.5 cpu / 570 pg- remaining cpu - 326.25- remaining pg - 317.5sleipnir -t2 425s x7t2 gyros x 3- requires 221.25 cpu / 973.2 pg- remaining cpu - 372.5- remaining pg - 851.8gee, i wonder what the problem might be?"
"also, i'll specifically address this comment, as apparently you can't read very well. i'm going to paste a quote from the first page, the fourth post, which is part of the op. it stands in total opposition to your moronic quote above and proves that your statement is, along with most everything else you post, delusional and misinformed.we are not asking to 'throw x pg at it so it can fit whatever', you idiot. we're asking to be able to fit a very basic setup using the lowest pg/dps weapons without fitting mods. of course, if you could read the thread you would have known that rather obvious fact."

"i don't see what the big deal is, i run missions in aramachi all the time and only been scanned and ninja-salvaged once, and he ran off after i started blowing wrecks up. i lost a couple million but the prober lost time aswell."
"salvage it directly or have a friend or something help with salvage. i don't see this being a big problem and ninjas have to spend time probing and searching. maybe gang up with the salvager and let him have salvage rights for a small fee and everyone should be happy. he doesn't have to stand around waiting to find a place and you don't have to go and get your salvage ship."

"sorry as an alt i can't agree with this i want my moments in the spotlight."
"voting will be a difficult issue to resolve. on the one hand you could attempt to do one account/one vote. it favors those who can afford more then one account.on the other hand you could do one ip address one vote. it forces those that use the same computer to have only one vote between them.i am unable to offer a solution at this time but i am also unable to support a voting system that clearly favors those that are more fortunate. it simply isn't democratic."
"*is blown away by the sheer volume of goons agreeing in this thread*"
"there are several problems with doing one vote per ip.1. not every case of multiple accounts per pc is due to one person having multiple accounts. sometimes it's due to multiple family members having accounts.2. i could have logged in yesterday from home, voted. logged in today from work, voted again. logged in from an internet cafe later in the week, voted yet again. each time from a different ip address. simply put, accounts will not necessarily be functioning from the same ip address all the time especially when you consider that these votes are going on a web based forum.believe me, i do sympathise with the concept that it should be one vote per user, however with the sheer number of alt accounts out there and no way of tracking whether a given account is an alt account at the moment does make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to properly regulate that. one vote per account, however, is workable and would make a decent compromise. yes it does mean that those with multiple accounts have a louder voice however we may be looking at this slightly wrong. the csm, at the moment, is being described as a purely democratic body. this isn't the case.it's actually more like a board of directors in a company. each account is effectively a 'share' so those with more accounts have more 'shares' and so have a greater say in what direction a company (in this case, the csm) goes in.edit:oh, and just to make it clear what position i'm coming from, i'm a single account holder with no alts at all. so this proposal wouldn't help me much but would be of great help to others."
"yes"
"this and the \"change all ammo type\" one"
"right now, a new or modified mission starts at the lowest isk+lp (~1500 lp for a l4 kill mission) reward level possible, then increases in reward when/if people succesfully finish it. this leads to a lot of people not doing the mission since it looks like it's not \"worth it\", leading to a very long time until the mission reaches it's intended value.new missions do not have guides detailing the npc strength/composition, therefore a new mission is more risky, thus should be more rewarding than an old mission.if instead a mission would start at the highest possible isk+lp reward (~5000+ lp for l4 kill mission) more people will want to do the mission. this will lead to the mission being scaled down quickly reward-wise, down to it's \"final\" value"
"sounds good to me. would probably have resulted in a few less people hating on l5 missions when they first came out."
"/signed.it's a shame we have to ask ccp to do this."
"no i disagreeto be frankly honnest missions give out too greater reward, a battlecruiser running lvl4 missions is a joke, the isk made in lvl4 missions is a joke and pve has just become a joke and a easy way too make isk. personaly missions need reworking, no way should a battlecruiser be able too run lvl4's, even a battleship should struggle too complete these missions. the rewards should be lower in empire space not 20+ mill from bountys and 5000 lp, in my eyes ccp are giving everyone isk on a sliver plate with the way pve is now, and it is wrong. yes im gonna get flamed for this post.and tbfh i dont realy care what you all think, pve is a way too gain easy isk and lots of it quick. missions have become a rinse and repeat affair and even 1.5sp newbies are doing lvl4's, this goes too show pve needs reworking totaly and not just giving in too forum whines about rewards being rubbish !!"
"this isn't really the place to discuss different issues, and doesn't actually address the point made by the op.i support this, though. it works better because by starting the rewards at the bottom of the scale translates into longer amounts of time before they balance themselves out, because fewer people do them."
"heck, even starting it at the middle-point would be better... assessing the difficulty beforehand by a pannel of mission designers, and setting a starting base value, now that would be best.barring that, highest point means least effort on ccp's side, and fastest way to reach the correct balace.anywhere except the lowest point is good.supported."
"sounds like a good idea."
"the count of supporting votes for a forum thread works fairly well as a gauge of support for that thread, but only as long as no one does any actual discussing. i think this is a problem for a forum where ideas are being shared and discourages good discourse. a very simple way to change this would be to add a number equal to the number of unique posters in the thread. this could be implemented with a single sql query and would much more accurately tell the amount of support an idea receives.you could display this one of two ways:1. the support column shows x out of y where x is the current number of supports and y is the number of people who posted in the thread2. a percentage of y/x, where x is the number of supports and y is the number of people who posted in the thread. the post or support of the op would not be included in this percentage."
"yes."
"this topic has my support."
"yep i would support this. going to take some forum programming though - but we can fairly easily add this into the already tabled discussion on forum issues in iceland i think."
"the idea to separate voting from posting does the same thing better. have each thread have a poll at the top for voting(if the forum software wasn't ****, this could be implemented easily), and you could see support at a glance. either use standardized options like 1-5 stars or \"full support/partial support/oppose/it's complicated\", or let players set up their own. i agree that it needs to be displayed in the forum proper, and your suggestions are good ideas of how to do so, but the fundamental problem is still that debate looks like opposition, and the best solution is still to break voting off of posting."
"also, i can support my own topic. kind of pointless since i'd say that if you post an idea you support it by default..."
"please allow us to be able to remotely repair an item or at least contract it while its damaged, and give the person who is accepting the contract the details of the damage.there is simply no reason why a slightly damaged item cannot be contracted. it gets worse if you are amarr. if there is a t2 or faction crystal that has been loaded into the gun, you cannot contract the item either.ty, hugs and kissesshigsy"

"proposed changes:- remove ability to dd through pos shields regardless of password. thought: the ability to dd through pos shields basically only rewards metagaming (bad) and exploits the intrinsic lack of accountability in an online game. plus, why would any pos maker actually be dumb enough to configure their shield to allow a 'friendly' doomsday through it? nuke this. no dd passes through any shield, friend or foe.- pos standings based on alliance standings rather than corp. thought: give an option check in pos management to do standings based on alliance level standings rather than corp level standings. most alliances use pos as an alliance asset, have it act accordingly. forcing people to mirror alliance standings at the corp level just so your pos won't be dumb is poor interface.- aggression timer not going away due to jump gate use. thought: sorry, the ability to jump through a gate and immediately log while cloaked is dumb. if you got shot on the other side, you are still aggro'd. aggro timer is 15 minutes, no unaggro by jumping.- damage inflicted record (for kms) not going away due to jump gate use. thought: if someone just shot you for 10k damage, you jump through a gate and take a rocket for your last 3 points of structure, the killmail lists the rocket guy as the only killer. that's not right. have damage stick around for 15 mins or so as well, regardless of system change. change of ships can remove it, as can docking.- self destruct still yield killmails via same rules as an npc kill (first other human gets mail).thought: in the event where someone is shooting at you and you self-destruct, it should treat it exactly like an npc kill. you die, and it just looks at the next highest source of damage and awards the mail accordingly. failure to do this just punishes people for _not_ bringing overkill all the time. if 3 brave battleships hold down a carrier, cycle in and out to hold points, and finally wear him down in an epic struggle they should get the credit. not oh sorry, you can't kill me in 2 minutes, so i self-destruct and it doesn't count. same issue with supercaps, etc.. if you only barely have enough damage to kill something, you should be rewarded for making the kill, not punished."
"i can get behind this."
"yep, happy to advocate these changes and fixes. i support the items here as a group issue (combat dynamics) and once this has been out here for a minimum 7 days discussion i'll be bring them to the csm for approval."
"i agree with the first 3 suggestions, but...honestly i think that people are far too concerned about killmails. in any situation where your opponent self-destructs you still have plenty of evidence that the combat took place such as combat logs. receiving killmails from self-destructing ships, in my opinion, is placing too much emphasis on personal pride and not enough emphasis on the fact that you have deprived your opponent of his ship.however, given the recent hp buffs, the self destruct timer should at least be increased to 3 or 4 minutes. i don't think that the killmails generated from self-destructing should show fittings, however."
"yup"
"before expending the agression mechanics they should first be properly documented and a visible 0.0 agression timer added. the current undocumented mobile warp disruptor mechanics for instance which create agression on both a player initiating warp in one and the player who deployed it without any visible indication this happened."
"this ^^^^^^"
"yep important point. i certainly believe that we need more visible timers on these issues. its just fair play really."
"no. people self-destructing to avoid killmails is the ****test thing ever. have you ever ganged a disparate bunch of people in lowsec to kill a carrier with battleships that was preying on your mates, and then he selfdestructs at structure? so annoying. killmails are how we record victories, and losses, and yeah sure there's a pride thing you point to and say we killed whoever. i don't see a problem with that."
"holy crap i agree with all of those ideas."
"yes it is a e-peen waving pride issue. but being it is a game, kill mails are away of keeping score. there is nothing wrong with that. industrialists and such will use wallet balances to do the same. waving there e-peen about how much money they make and what kind of pimped out ship they fly. just like in times of war pilots would stamp the kill on their airships to show there achievements, and fellow pilots would try to compete with that. there is nothing wrong with showing pride in your accomplishments."
"so would you be okay with self destruct mails not containing any fitting information?"
"eve needs to support a variety of play styles, so simply because killmails aren't something that you personally may value does not mean that eve should support them in an incomplete manner. killmails are the record of combat events, and important to a large number of players. let's make sure they are thorough, accurate, and generated upon any meaningful death.[dunno if i actually get to support my own idea or not, but take that regardless :p ]"
"excellent!"
"i don't care how ccp does it or what reason they use to do it, but please return the helios back to the maulus base model with the little antennae.-- everything else below is just my side rant. the single sentence above is really all i'm after. --all i am asking for in this thread in terms of support is the helios model be returned. nothing else. i do not want this thread to turn into \"give it a highslot\" or any other issue. players have verbalized feelings of betrayal, angst, discontentment and even upset stomachs over the new helios model.while there was a very logical reason for the change, i believe that ccp has taken an illogical approach to changing it when most of the players who enjoy flying the helios were up in arms over the change before it hit the main server, tranquility.sidenote: it is my belief that ccp seriously took zero effort into making the imicus version of the helios. it does not have a single polygon added and it has just been reskinned with a new greenish texture. not impressed."
"/signedthe imicus hull imo doesn't give the covert ops style look as the maulus hull did.and those that say 'it spends most the time cloaked, who cares what it looks like'... you can still see the outline of it while its cloaked ;)"
"morphed you have to press the little support button. go edit your post :p"
"/signed friends don't let friends fly imicus"
"hell yeah, likewise with the cheetah/vigil. the probe/imicus don't look like high tech covert ships, they look like junk cargo haulers."
"i self destructed mine and training for the amarr frig now"
"why do you need a remodel on a ship you cant even see most of the time?change is something that is most of the time for the best, in a few weeks it will basicly be a non issue"
"i agree"
"i agree, old helios was sexy. this one is minmatar..."
"cov ops frig = astrometrics cruiser. this is just common sense. now, if you want a prettier imicus, maybe, but changing the model of your cov ops frigate back to that of a combat frigate is silly."
"why do you care so much because your covert ops ship, a ship that will be invisible during most of it's operation, looks cool or not? even if this took five minutes, it would be a waste of manpower."
"i prefer the 'make the imicus model less of an eye-bursting abomination' option, myself. having the covops use the astrometrics frig hull rather than the e-war frig is only sensible for purposes of continuity, even if it is ugly."
"have you not realised they are merely matching the t1 astrometrics hulls, with the t2 astrometrics ships ?so no, this should not be changed back. it has finally been changed and this is how it should stay."
"i prefer consistency, especially when it comes to a ship that i see for only 30 seconds every few days.don't waste time on this nonsense."
"may be nonsense to you but to others it is not nonsense. your opinion is it is nonsense, my opinion is the imicus is dead ugly and ccp did not even spend any time at all making it look nice. plus, it is more of a standpoint that gallente are slowly turning into last year's amarr (where you have people shout boost gallente on the forums) and now we're getting stuck with a dog of a ship when it was once a most attractive little gem.maybe because i just enjoy looking at it, alright? fact is a lot of the time it is not cloaked because i'm alone in a system. or, when i'm docked i enjoy it's curves.simple fact is, the ship is pretty. ccp can figure out some way or another to maybe swap around things so they can put the helios back in.and to the person that said it's a waste of manpower, do you understand anything about qa? right."
"the point is a covert ops ship is that exactly, it is not there to be pretty. it is there to be hidden and sneaky. the fact it looks a little exotic does not make this ship unflyable or unusable. it should not change.please see arguments in former post, this change balances the game."
"i prefer to keep the current model of the helios. the imicus hull is the probe ship, mot the maulus."
"helios was sexy..."
"swap the maulus and imicus hulls, give the helios its old hull, make the keres the new helios hull.consistency solved, people happy."
"its just looks bleh now :p"
"yeah only nobody flies the keres because it is a crappy ship."
"the imicus is by far the ugliest thing flying in the gallente fleet. and re-skinning it to make electronic attack ships more appealing is just a dirty move. do not change ship models midway threw the game. not only does it break the 4th wall big time, but those pilots that worked hard and trained months of time away to get a ship they liked for it's role and looks are just slapped in the face by this change.if ccp wants to make their new lovechild more appealing than use the same model and re-skin it or :gasp: make a new model for the e-war ships."

"cheetah needs the same love.new models are awful."
"helios is sneaky sexy indeed!"
"no support.the change to the helios was in fact a buff. it reminds you that you forgot to activate your cloak."
"i don't care what this ship looks like. but..since siigari's brainwashing still hasn't faded i'll support."
"after flying around in my helios i quite like the new hull.not supported"
"these are practical ships. no.1 purpose is not to look nice.you want beauty, look at a non-cloaking ship."
"meh. either way it's fine. it's cloaked half the time anyhow."
"the imicus is the logic t1 hull to use. leave it this way."
"can we make a vote to scrap every lopsided piece of crap in eve? i mean, who thought it would look good to have tumescent blobs flying around in space?anyway, it seems like most that fly the helios on a regular basis want it returned to the original model. why? because we have to look at the ship constantly. we're the ones sitting in station spinning in circles. we're the ones that still see the shape of the ship while it's cloaked. so if it doesn't affect you, bugger off."
"if you fly it as much as you say you do you do not have to look at it, it should be cloaked!i still dont get what all the fuss is about. its a ship that should not even be visable 80%+ of the time.the change went in to make things easier for the inventors out there. if you seriously dislike the model make sure you cloak more often"
"/signed, for *most of thesei know it's probably late, but here are some other suggestions for features i've been hoping to see but don't hear others asking for:-ability for cfos/jr. accountants to modify orders submitted for corporations-skills to meter the extent of the \"market history\" that's visible at a time (lv1: 1 week --> lv5: 1 year)-new revenue streams from services currently run by npcs or would improve pvp/pve - repair stations, clone vats at poses, toll jumpbridges, \"wingman\" automated fighter-assignment vending machines, etc-t2 named loot bpcs dropped in 0.0, specced somewhere between t2 and faction gear and requiring t2 components and salvage to build-speaking of, salvage/tractor drones!-and finally: a capital ship that allows for sales of goods directly from it's cargohold, with appropriate standings filters etc.*t1 loot drops are more important to the economy that most industrialists will ever admit -- they allow for a secondary mineral stream that doesn't involve shooting rocks for long hours. changing this system would have very dire consequences for anyone but the hardcore miners and macroers which are already too populous in the game."

"delegates are required not to look like fools in public, aren't they?"
"meets with great approval and justice."
"supported. - i would also add that remote termination of a jump clone would be extremely useful as well."
"/signed.i'd suggest a specific number of allowed jumps in a time period, so we aren't stuck with fixed intervals and have some leeway. something like twice or thrice in 24 hours, so you can jump into your combat clone and back into your training clone, and maybe also back into your combat clone if duty calls unexpectedly."
"i do think 24 hours is a bit excessive."
"4 hours would be awesome (with skills of course.) 12 hours without would be pretty cool too."
"there has yet to be a negative response about this, and for a good reason. i would gladly train an extra skill in order to let me jump clone more often."
"the danger with reduced jump clone timers is allowing people to bounce from clone to clone too easily to swap between locations or implant sets (learning implants in particular) with much less risk.for example, you're sitting in your +4 set learning clone when somebody starts an impromtu fleet op, you jump into a blank clone so that your implants are not in danger, go on the op and then a few hours later you bounce back into the learning set and carry on your accelerated training. you're still getting the reward from the implants for all but a few hours, but you're not putting them at any risk.its understandable that people want this - after all, we all would want more use out of our learning implants while keeping them safe - but i'm not convinced the proposal is compatible with the 'risk vs reward' philosophy."
"that is, apart from traveling insane distances, the only reason for jump clones to exist in the first place. it's quite a bit like switching between differently rigged ships."

"if csm only gets 1 thing done this needs to be it."
"the king's dead, long live the king!seriously, are you all so democratically impaired that you need to get taught democracy by an autocracy? you should now better.future csms will be able to base their manner of operation on the previous ones, amending and changing procedure where deemed necessary. a period of confusion and internal fighting is common for any newly instantiated body, you have to give evolution a chance to kick in."
"all the western democracies work only because of two prerequisites:1. a written constitution that states the rights and it's limits of those who participate in the political process, often to the point of being very explicit when it comes to parliamentarian preocedure.2. a constitutional court, that interprets this constitution when the need arises.the constitutional document provided by ccp leaves much to be desired. indeed it looks like something, they may have come up with during lunch break, and left it by that.there is no constitutional court for the csm and ccp seems unwilling to step up to this role (probably shows how much they really care about this).that a constitution for the csm will be worked out in consensus by the csm itself is a bit naive, regarding the animosities that prevail there. historically the constitutions of the western countries that guarantee their democracy have come to pass in mostly very undemocratic ways, i.e. as results of revolutions or wars. though it surely would be entertaining seeing heads being loped off in some csm meeting, it surely would be more practical when ccp would get their head out of their behinds and provide the basics, so that the csm could actually work."
"doing so would undermine the legitimacy of the council. let me explain:the \"constitution\" put forth by ccp goes on to lengths to express the intent of the council, which is to put an inalienable right of the players, that of governmental participation, into practice. i should rather say \"constituted form\", as every company has to listen to its customers. ccp has stated what they are willing to to, namely meet with the council and even pledge to answer issues brought forth by it. to do this, they have to have one specific community partner, and not just people claiming to be that entity. thus the need for a specific form of governmental body is created, as ccp themselves have to organize elections.this given, we have a social contract. still, the only part of the constitution that has an implicit eternity clause is defined by ccps need for a clearly identifiable partner that represents the community: the rest is just needed to bootstrap the contract. ccp cannot object any community-supported reshaping of the council as long as their part of the contract does not change and is much likely to accept other changes as long as we don't all want to go to iceland on their bill. this might be, for example, changing the maths of the election procedure. i very much doubt they would even issue a statement should the community or council decide to extend the council to 100 members, acting as a parliament electing nine of their own to meet with ccp in person. they would just accept it.the judiciary, as in any contract which cannot be based on a law all agreeing parties are subject to, is the agreement itself. ccp should not and as far as i see will not interfere in any politics between customers themselves, doing such would be autocratic beyond legitimacy, like the queen feeling scottish, ordering the english to wear kilts and play bagpipes. utter indecency would arise.what i'm trying to express here is that a player government not ruled to the utmost extend possible by the players themselves is an epic failure. the council should not, or rather must not, look to ccp for advice, as ccp is the entity it's supposed to oppose and approach on eye-height. i expect ccp to act in a laissez-faire way, shrugging if the community fails to organize in a sane manner in the good conscience that they aren't the ones to blame. doing otherwise would undermine their very intent: to have a partner at eye-height instead of being able to look down on individual players, only having to react if wide-spread utter indecency arises:communication is only possible between equals.i, and most likely ccp, too, do not care how long it takes until this goal is met, as long as it isn't jeopardized in the meantime. we should take our time to implement a government we can be patriotic about, a state where one council member can say to another \"you're putting your agenda over the government\" and have the other one fall silent immediately. council members, at one time, will be aware that they are not a member get their voice heard, but to get the voice of their voters heard. cries for impeachment won't make that happen, neither voting for the right candidates on its own. only acceptance of the council for that what it is meant to be.maybe the council should start off with not putting the vote-able chairman issue on the agenda but just elect. make a motion for procedure, including or excluding alternates and then go on. show some teeth. how can the players trust in the council's ability to squeeze answers to topics ccp does not want to talk about out of ccp if it can't even elect its own chairman without begging for permission?"
"thing is kitoba there is a question about what we want to achieve here. is it playing a virtual committee simulator and spending time wrangling over power-plays on the council or is it getting player-issues through the process and raised for formal discussion with ccp? you might not think the two things are necessarily contradictory but when we have meeting time limits and some real life intruding on how much effort each csm can put into the process each week it does turn into a matter of compromising one thing to focus on the other. this csm committee can be excellent when we're talking about gameplay issues and balance and advocated ideas. but its pretty terrible when its discussing procedure and outright heinous when matters of moderation and balance and political interest groups get involved using the csms as figureheads and rallying banners. i've come to the conclusion this week that we should be minimizing procedural discussion as much as absolutely possible because its just not a fruitful use of our time. i'd much rather be talking about x,y,z gameplay-boosting ideas during these 2 hour meetings than wasting more time on whatever the current political threadnaught topic is. and i think at the end of the six month term we're going to be judged by the general electorate on what we manged to get done and successfully advocated to ccp in terms of these gameplay issues than what we achieved in the field of political invention and playing games with the committee structure. speaking personally if i end this term and people remember me as \"there goes jade the guy who got pvp docking aggression timers increased, black ops fixed and the nighthawk its power grid buff\" i'll be pretty happy at end of the day and reckon the people that voted for me will have gotten a good deal.if on the other hand its nothing but \"there goes jade the numpty that spent 20 weeks arguing about whether the committee needs to pass a motion signing off minutes and whether the chair has power to call time on debates\" then most players who voted for me will feel justifiably robbed of an opportunity to influence game improvements.this is a game we're talking about here. its a game we all play sure, but it is about spaceships on the internet and improving aspects of that game to the common good. ccp wanted a varied cross-section of reps from all sides of the game and they've pretty got that, our job now is to make sure all those sides get represented and get a chance to have their issues heard. not every issue we're going to be individually-raising will be liked by everyone in the player base, but its important that everyone in the player base feels at least one of the representatives can look at and potentially advocate the issues they feel are important."
"oh, sorry. i meant to say \"put your egos aside, stfu and get to work.\" failure to do so will not get any of you reelected. if you aren't able to constrain yourselves, neither will ccp."
"tbqh - i would have thought that basic meeting etiquette and a copy of robert's rules of order ("
"ccp does not want to interfere in any way with the council. they have provided some further guidance which has resulted in the current changes which have gotten us past our most contentious issues. i wouldn't even have said that as i've not been cleared, but i'll assume jade has because jade's quoted the email in various places. that's about all i can say without violating both the eula and my nda.i agree that the administrative discussion doesn't add any value. to be frank it shouldn't have been necessary in the first place. i won't allude to fictional conspiracies or make-believe factions though because they simply don't exist. people on the council have different beliefs. that is as was intended. if some of those beliefs did not overlap in agreement there'd never be the possibility of a yes or no vote on anything. this isn't the x-files though i'll admit that may be more palatable than accepting personal responsibility for one's actions."
"this is what i believe is the biggest problem. we have players that will not let go of the goon conspiracies, bob spy plants and rp faction agenda's. essentially we have members showing up still logged in. at times i do see some discussions of clarity and then i see the spewing of the crap that belongs in game. if there is a next csm, i am hoping the next candidates will at least bring an out of game objectivity."
"palatable? i'm surprised your stomach hasn't lept up your throat to strangle you just to stop you from making it turn when you utter such unbelievably absurd \"pot calling the kettle black\" bull. nothing you've done on the csm is reprehensible? you're just an innocent hard working csm representative? integrity is your middle name?if you can get people to believe that, you've got a great future selling swamp land as \"waterfront retirement communities\".windjammer"
"there's a reason people can't let go of the \"goon conspiracies\" and that reason is they exist. some goons are dedicated to a machiavellian style of forum warfare. for them, distorting the truth, stretching the truth, twisting the truth or just flat out lying is a valid tactic. one to be giggled over and admired. their only interest in truth is how they can best bend it to obtain what they desire.your own posts lend themselves to scrutiny within this context. i've read quite a few of them now and can only conclude you're an alt of a goonswarmer. if you're not, you may as well be. you take up their cause in every instance that i've witnessed and ignore or down play any criticism of them.windjammer"
"i wholeheartedly agree with these two statements and support the suggestion of the op as an option worthy of serious consideration. there's an obvious need for an authority outside the csm to stabilize the csm meetings. at least until the csm gets over its birthing pains.regards,windjammer"

"well by your reasoning that would make you jades alt, trying to undermine csm reps that you do not like or players that happen to disagree with you. is this a true statement. probably not. but that is how all this crap is created because of this kind of conspiracy theories and finding a boogie man under every rock.if you notice my post i made the reference to all three tinfoil hat conspiracies spewed by the three major sources on these forum, not giving any defense to any one party.and whom i decide to align my self matters not, as i only support the ideas that would possibly help in the long run. no matter from which source it comes from. by trying to chide me into your way of thinking will not sway me or to jump on the tinfoil hat bandwagon. i do not have time for that mess.i present my views as objectively as i can. i have disagreed with subjects that goons support like the removal of learning skills, and supported documents like pitbosses proposal. who is a privateer btw. which last time i checked they war dec them a lot. also i support repo who is also have been killing the goons. so i am not sure how you came up with that. but if it makes you feel better more power to you. i guess by my way of thinking and support i guess lend my self to pirate more than that of a bunch of noobs who reprocesses a dd mod to make frigs. who knows maybe i was at one time suggardaddy that choked out hagilur or maybe foe alliance drone from the day. who knows, but i am sure you can come up with something fanciful."
"inventors have more overall profit-making potential than t2 bpo holders, but it comes at an exponential increase in time, effort and risk. exponential.i've got a healthy t2 bpo portfolio, and i dedicate about one hour every week maintaining all of the inputs/outputs for each print. one hour. sometimes less. it's pretty awesome. it's really cheesy though.sure, invention murdered my profit margins, but they're still astronomical by real world standards. 500%? 600%? 700%? 800%? 900%? all the while pricing product lines at rates intended to make inventors cry. i may not be making 5+, 10+, 15+ billion a month off of each bpo like pre-invention times, but it's still a decent living and it comes with the added bonus of knowing you're urinating in some inventor's hopes and dreams for profits.so yeah, removing t2 bpo wouldn't be a bad idea. it'd suck for those of us with them, but oh well. mountains of isk get sort of boring after awhile anyways."
"so let me understand this?.you are a multi t2 bpo holder, you say your profit margin at the moment is between 500 and 900% (how can you not know exactly if your building stuff and selling it?). and al5though you are still making 500%-900% profit you seem to want them removed because you are bored with making mountains of isk?.now i do ot want to really call anybody a liar, but your a liar."
"margins vary based on which print and which market the product is unloaded at. ask around and poll people who have mountains of isk. sure, isk is great and all, but after a certain point it starts to lose meaning. just because someone has reaped great benefits from an unbalanced model doesn't mean that they can't acknowledge the flaws in the system. no, i'm not naive enough to trash my own prints since most likely noone else will. so until the day comes when t2 bpo across the board are gone, i'll sit back and enjoy griefing markets.thanks for the comments though."
"the amount of misinformation being given in this thread about the profit differences between invention and bpo's is pretty amazing. i'm not sure if it's because of ignorance of the actual values or because of an attempt to hide the truth and point at the fabricated numbers as proof that it's not that bad.first, let's look at time investment:a non-researched vagabond bpo (which you can get the stats for on the market) is as follows:pe 0 give you a production time of around 1d 12h or so with industry v, which is required to build it.invention has to deal not only with the pe, but the time involved to get the bpc in the first place. if you had a pos with a laboratory cranking out the max-run bpcs for invention and doing the invention itself with, the time investment would be around 4-5 days per attempt. and since both invention and copying are lab activities, you're limited by either your laboratory operations skill, which can allow for quite a bit, or extra characters to do the inventing. if you did this with empire slots... well, you could wait for weeks for a copying slot.then there's the actual production cost.me 0 gives you a cost of around 52m isk to build the ship with jita parts, assuming you have a production efficiency skill of v. less means it costs more, but thanks to the magic of multiplication, the overall percentages remain the same. a vagabond sells for around 81m right now, which is a profit of almost 60%.each negative level of me past 0 adds almost 10% more to the construction cost with a few minor exceptions (r.a.m. and the hull, specifically). it's been a little while since i last invented anything, but i think the best me you can get for an invented ship is -1, which also only gives you a single run, increasing the overhead cost of that ship. i personally went for the -2 me, 2 run bpc option as that gave me what i felt was the best risk/return option.each one of those attempts, accounting for failure rate, decryptors, bpcs, run time, etc, gave something like a 7.5m overhead to each run, something a bpo holder doesn't have to deal with at all.none of these issues are even seen by bpo holders. so this is what we're looking at:at least a 10% higher cost of production, a copying overhead cost (yes, there's still a cost if you provide all of the items needed. it's called an opportunity cost), and the time investment. this could easily push the cost of each ship to being 30% or more higher than the bpo-produced one.oh, and the production amount from that bpo? again with the vagabond option you're looking at approximately 2 vagabonds every 3 days, so that's around 20 of them a month. invention can give you more, sure, but you've got the time investment to get that bpc, then the often negative pe effect as well (which can push the production time per hull close to 3 days in some cases).it's not a tiny difference. it's a pretty huge one.as for the 'cost' of those bpo's. as stated by others before, their initial cost was laughably small. to claim that the cost paid to purchase the bpo from another player should be protected is laughable and flies directly in the face of any concept of risk that supposed to be part of the basis for this game."
"i'd call for a motion to inject tii bpos at an increasing rate into the game as tiii approaches, think exploration or random chance of invention resulting in bpo's, but then noone's gonna listen to my sanity.or you're all so stunned by my ideas that you rather keep silent as not to embarrass yourselves. it's hard to tell, you know."
"wait. you're serious, aren't you?so, in your ideal world, inventors have. . .better me for less material usage (important on large stuff and especially with dysprosium so expensive)better pe for faster buildingall the advantages of parallel building capacityand the ability to go off and make something else when the market for widget iis tanks?all this, and all you get for your trouble is not having to burn a few dozen datacores that get cheaper by the week as more people line up to farm them.i take it someone had a particularly long failure streak on their marauder jobs?"
"\"disintegrate immediately the imperial apoc, federate megathron, guardian vexor, raven state issue, ecc. they can't the acquired in game.\"other dumb thoughts to share with us?"
"no cost like:- training the needed skill to get the r&d agents when they gave nothing if you weren't lucky;- running the missions for the standing;- running the missions for the r&d agents when they were asking decent items and not tritanium (like 35 science graduates, find them if you can);- waiting a year before the lottery restart as you have started playing at the end of the previsous round of the lottery; - spending all the accumulated rp for a bpo (25k rp for a quake l bpo? it is worth 250 millions? that was the price when i got it).sure 0 cost, no work."
"boy you are a bad liar. you don't know a bit about the bpo return. or you are a very bad builder and think that the minerals and t2 building materials are free because you build them yourself."
"while the use of the copy slots has a cost (pos fuel) if you are using a character trained to invent to produce the copies you are doing it wrong. you should start a new alt in one of the science schools, train him a bit and you have a character that can run several copy jobs at little cost and without using invention slots. you can use the same character to do r&d for agents to get some extra datacore too."
"i might have supported the idea if the tone would have been a little more constructive. the whole t2 bpo discussion is a matter of people owning them ridiculing people that don't for their building skills and people that don't own them crying about how unfair the game is. neither is helping the issue forward.i would say that a little research into the matter to come up with a better solution than \"let's just not touch it for now\" is called for. i can see options that might be fair, if properly looked at by people with all the information (i.e. ccp + player builders). for example: how about turning all the existing bpo's into bpc's with a number of runs that far exceeds what you would normally be able to get - or better still, a pile of normal maxed out bpcs that don't break the rules and have the added advantage of being distributable. the trick is getting the number of runs right, but that's what the research is needed for. this way, there would be no need to refer to changes 3 years into the future, even though the end effect might be just as far away for even the most productive builders. as a another side effect, these bpcs would start out with a monetary value equal to (or perhaps even above) the current bpos, but would nicely go down when used to balance the 'unfairness' over time.just an example, i'm sure there's people out there with better ideas, but at least a little more thought than \"let's get rid of them\" should go into it...fly well and have fun,grismar."
"only if the t2 bpo holder is somehow prevented from inventing."
"the problem is that the spread of t2 bpo quality is very large, so what can be \"fair\" for 1 of those bpo is \"unfair\" for another. the best thing is to let's the me and pe of the original t1 bp influence the values on the final t2 bpc when inventing.that will remove the only true advantage left to t2 bpo, the research done on them. and that it is not a so large advantage as you can think, researching them is a long process. i have researched a t2 barrage m bpo. to get some pe it required more that 20 days of lab, and the advantage was going from 8 hours as production time to 7 hours, 20 minutes. to recover the isk i hadn't gained while doing the research it required 240 days with the new, improved speed. so 2/3 of a years were used to be exactly at the point were i would have been if i had done no research (and i am not considering the cost of fueling the pos). after that point i have started gaining a 9,1% extra. invention an be more of a hassle (not really, i do it, and the really annoying part is researching the market, not building or inventing), but a t2 bpo is a lot of capital imobilized for a very small return."
"what the inventors and whiners fail to realize is that increasing the me or pe of invention or screwing around with it to make it more efficient will not help them what so ever simply because the builders will still try to under cut each other and reduce profits even further.bpo holders and bpo's are not the problem and do not effect the market or the profits of inverters at all, inventors are doing that by competing with each other so a reduction in costs will either not effect profits or reduce them further and bpo's have nothing to do with it."
"given that people actually pay tens of billions for them, i'd have to say that they can't be that bad an investment. nobody gets 40 billion without having some idea of how to judge profitability."
"i specifically mentioned using an alt, which is what i did.using a pos to help with invention also carries the additional costs of running that pos which, once again, increases the overhead by even more for the inventor."
"wow, give this man a cookie. you came up with another good idea. although the imbalance created by a few people playing hangar queen with these ships is no where near the effect that t2 bpos have.i see the old playes are still with their fingers in their ears refusing to listen to explanations on total cost and effort between invention and bpo. yes it will. they would now compete at a better than bpo cost base. the effort will still be higher but the end product will be cheaper. it will allow them to eliminate the profit margins of bpo holders in the major markets.i never said players in this game were very smart in their purchases. isk != iq"
"bpo holders ain't dropping the prices down its the inventors that are crashing the market cos of competition the bpo holders will set prices around the cost of the market but inventors are constantly under cutting each other. so making invention easier or cheaper will just make t2 items cheaper and thus less profit for all but bpo holders have nothing to do with the decrease."
"waaaaaaaaaaaah? is that what you were trying to say? that ccp dared to implement some system where bpo holders would have some competition? ccp preserved a profit margin for you by making invention have -me. inventors will never be able to compete with you purely on a cost basis. if there are some people that are selling items below invention cost somewhere buy the **** and relist it. don't come crying on the forums that invention killed your exorbitant margins and now you are stuck with margins that are still better than anyone else has."
"never had a t2 bpo or any other sort for that matter and i could not care about t2 holders profit or inventors for that matter. what i do not like is \"waaabulance\" nerfits who think that they deserve to be given a free hand out or up while others spent years getting into the same position.t2 bpo holder deserve to make a little more profit that ppl without them and considering that they do not effect the profits that inventors make one bit the only reason to remove them is because of jealous cry baby prats who are never satisfied no matter what is done."
"t2 bpo holders deserve nothing. when things need to change the last thing that needs to be thought about is entitlement. when titans get nerfed will the alliances that build them get a refund? nope. it doesn't matter that you spend 60 billion isk on the titan bpo and many billions more to build one. when **** is broken you fix it.like i said before some ccp dev probably has a ton of t2 bpos which is why we will never end up seeing this fixed. i wish i could prove this though."
"bpo's work fine as far as ive been told and they have zero impact on players in eve other than those who own them or buy them in the future, so not broken in fact working perfectly.if your going to make accusations of corruption within ccp i suggest you have facts to back it up or start a thread for the csm to investigate it."
"yes, proper accounting and math is oh so difficult nice try at refuting points by trying the marginalize-your-opponent route.who knows. maybe your prints are no longer very profitable. maybe you are a horrifically inept builder. honestly, that's most likely not the case - but it's a strong strategic move for you to try to paint the picture that t2 bpo holders are oh-woe-is-me nerfed and deserve more. i understand why you would take that tack, but it's somewhat transparent.as far as the other guy's assertion that t2 bpo holders aren't the ones driving margins down, in some cases this is true but in others it most definitely isn't. some t2 bpo holders derive a warped sense of glee by griefing inventors and other bpo holders. i know that i do. unfortunately i've only been able to kill the margins on four, maybe five, product lines (which really is just a drop in the bucket)."
"still more lies from the guy who claimed to be making 500-900% profit from his bpo's, after invention came out.you should have researched prices and profit margins before posting this total delusion."
"um. how bout we replace the bpos with like 1000 or 10,000 (some large number) of bpcs at the current me/pe of the bpo. then you have a few years worth of jobs to build steady or you can sell off good bpcs, or you can keep the steady rate you have now and coast still for a few years as everyone else vapors their bpcs and the price comes back up.not really saying bpos need to be killed but seemed a better compromise than a single max run bpc for a friggin bpo."
"while i am still seeing all kinds of acrimonious shouting in this thread, with people saying other people deserve nothing, and etc... may i suggest shouters, again, go to this thread:"
"market forces will eventually devalue them to reasonable levels of sane cost.that is.. once people finally catch a clue and grasp that a 2 year roi for anything in this game is a little insane."
"i know the answers already.i stand by my statement of: if it's not available for anyone to get then it shouldn't be in the game. it's the same reason that the lottery was a failure as a game concept and why many other games that try the same type of thing remove it shortly after. except in this case there is some unkown reason to keep the remenants of a failed system around. to make it even more funny they made invention less profitable than the bpos.as far as my hypothesis of ccp employees having t2 bpos. it's the only logical reason that i can come up with that they are still around. eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable must be the truth (yes i stole a quote). since there is no logical reason to leave t2 bpos in the game what remains is that personal interest has interfered with good game design sense."
"lemme just say one thing... if you don't like the way ccp runs the game then why are you playing it? it is just a game after all, no one is forcing you to play it."
"why are you reading this forum? all this forum contains are people asking for changes that they would like to see in game. that is the purpose of this forum. to discuss what you would like to see changed. hence we are discussing it. this thread is for talking about t2 bpos. this is not for complaining about other forum members. please stay on topic. thanks"
"your ignoring the obvious reasons they do not remove them like:1. as with the fed navy and other ships the t2 bpo's are a pinnacle of their particular type in the game.2. they effect game design and game play not at all unless your a jealous and bitter nerf hound, and so there is no reason to remove or nerf them unlike every other removal or nerf the game has seen.3. they are available or at least can be available for ppl to buy if they have enough isk to do so.now considering these facts id say your sherlock holmes logic needs a lot of work."
"i disgree almost completely with the op. i don't even own a single bpo of any sort, and i'll be the first to say that those who have them have the right to keep them./not signed"
"1) t2 bpos have nothing to do with things that anyone can purchase by running some missions. maybe if they removed the missions and left the ships in the game you might have a point. if you are talking about unique ships that have been given out in the past that isn't a good idea either.2) either they a) don't matter or b) are extremely valuable (see: contracts). so either they are imbalanced which is shown by the ridiculous sale prices or they don't matter so no one should miss them if they were to be removed.3) a bpo that i want never comes up to contract or it's put up at such a high price it is unfeasable to own it. either way it doesn't matter. it's not available."
"nice argument well presented.even if they are ridiculously priced nobody is forced to buy them, and they do not matter to others as far as effecting profits are concerned. so the only reason to remove or nerf them is because ppl are bitter cos they do not own one and that is the worst reason to do anything as ppl like that (you) should not be catered to ever.just because you think the price is unfeasible does not mean other would not like to add one to their trophy case, who do you think you are to remove a item from the game that has zero effect on your game at all just because you feel its over priced."
"finally we hear some truth here... the above exemplifies all of your arguments - you do not have the isk or the ability to buy a good bpo, and you want to take it away from all others that have them, one way or another. basically we come down to a real reason why all the people who want t2 bpos be taken out of game - their own inability to make enough isk and their own jealousy at the others."
"let me boil this down as simple as possible. it is in ccp's best interest to preserve some sort of equal opportunitiy between players. this is the basis of pretty much every multiplayer game design.good game designers don't arbitrarily say ok you get a free pass and you don't. you don't just give an arbitrary set of people a magic bullet that instantly kills everyone else and even dream of it being considered fair. that is why the lottery system was doomed from the moment it was conceived. work should be rewarded. more work should reward more. this is why invention is so great. randomness is part of the system but not so much that it prohibits anyone from entering a market.i never want to purchase a blueprint and i have no interest in building anything. i could not care less about owning one of these or reaping the rewards of having such an item. if you think this has anything to do with me you are wrong. this is about getting ccp to realize they ****ed up.if you want to rant and rave about how bitter i am please go ahead. maybe we can reference some conspiracy theories too."
"ok. good luck with your credibility and all that. i still say you are causing trouble and are jealous, and masking it with \"fair game\" and \"balance\" garbage. i have read what you were saying, and was just waiting for a slip up like above, again, your kind always comes out with it, you are just not careful enough, or clear-headed enough to try an avoid pitfalls of fallacy."
"bpo's in the game do nothing to effect the profits of inventors so other than jealousy your whole point here is worthless.the rewards are minuscule for a good builder and just because you cannot afford one or do not want one is not reason to remove them from the game. in fact because you want nothing to do with them they do not effect you or your game play at all."
"oh yes my jealousy drives me . i'm just against free rides which the lottery and the t2 bpo situation was / is. i suppose that makes me jealous. whatever, you won't listen to anything i say and i won't listen to what you say."
"thank you for being honest, for once, and admitting the truth in whatever perverse form it may be."
"i think the entire point of the standing requirement is so that people dont just load up an emtpy character slot and flood fw with ships. the standing is there so that there is some regulation on faction members attacking within their corp, so that pirates who enter just to shoot corp mates get kicked pretty soonish. to remove this would result in a mess."
".5 is really fine and easily achievable, doable in trial-time. you wouldn't want to pvp with a character young enough not to have those standings, anyway. and if you messed up your standings, it's your fault.jumpclone standing requirements are too high, though, but this belongs into features & discussion first."
"not true, i did them on a trial account and you dont' even get faction standings."
"run a couple of cosmos missions. you should get to +0.5 faction base quite fast."
"there needs to be a minimum requirement otherwise it would be to easy to join up with different races and 0.5 isn't much. you'll get more standing increase with skills and with better agents and higher level missions so i doubt you have to complete 200 missions."
"tl;dr: easier bug-report. preferably in-game.i know of a great lot of people that won't file bug reports simply because the entire thing seems like something of an audacious effort. we trade, we fly spaceships, we do all sorts of stuff. on the time dedicated to eve each day, the overly thorough manner for reporting bugs is not prioritized.especially after patches, speedy reporting of issues can be vital. i propose, therefore (but more for the convenience of everyone), that ccp opens up for a bug report that can be filed in-game and much more easily. not necessarily to replace the current one (at all!), but to provide ccp with tips for issues that don't need detailed logs. like, say, items disappearing from markets or similar."
"agreeing with this. also something automated to grab logserver outputs, and dxdiags etc would be pretty good, dunno if it's possible though."
"/signed, though i think this motion is incomplete: much more has to be addressed, like unprofessionality of bh's (not having payed staff for support) and ccp's attitude to fixing bugs in general."
"they definitely need to be easier. things that would save some time would be the ability (with the user's permission, obviously) to grab logserver files and computer specs would save a significant amount of time."
"i do not know if this has been raised before. but i personally think \"petitioning\" takes too long.give us a button where you can isntantly report a isk-seller as soon as he posts in local or any of the chats.1) right click his name2) choose :\"isk -seller\" or \"report\"3) done.by this it could maybe become too annoying/take more time for them to post again, making it not worth their time bothering.am i alone in thinking this would be a good idea?edit: spelling.like an opportunity to have them muted/blocked from chatting/posting by the time of reporting them, and also,misuse = ban, not permanent at first but repeat offenders could have that.tl'drfaster, more accessible and more powerful way of countering isk-sellers, as opposed to the petitoning."
"supporting my own idea ofcourse."
"this idea is poor, and i dont support it.its obviously going to be missused by people if its availible to everyone and anyone.reporting isk spammers is effectivly reporting that theres a disposiable trail acc alt spamming. do you think the devs care or spend any time on these complaints?i don't think theres any permenant solution to the isk selling problem (in any mmo) but one short term solution:give rad people like me the ability to block on a global scale, i block you, nobody see's your isk spam in any channel anywhere in eve.giving a few people who regually watch 10k channels this ability would frustrate farmers/sellers, and eventually they;ll change to other forms of advertising.obviouly the pilots would 'global block' would be held accountable for their actions, and face a ban if it was missused."
"i saw the same problem myself, but more like an opportunity to have them muted/blocked by the time of reporting them.which is pretty muh the same way you describe, but ofcourse with some check-up.misuse = ban for reporting.in other ways it's just the same as petitioning a isk-seller but faster. apart from the mute that is."
"this is an idea taken from wow(unless it was somewere else 1st). basicly when the report spam function came out in wow there was a big uproar about it beeing abused etc, but in reality it isnt.the one key thing to make sure that it isnt abused is to only deal with reports from multiple people and pref within a certian time(ie 2 or 3 mins) this basicly means that its pretty hard to abuse(as long as you set the reports to quite a few people)this could also be used to limit some of the spam that goes on not from the evil rlmt's, such as contract spaming in jita, or recruitment channel spaming etc. adding in an auto temp block to this also helps."
"yes, ban! block! moaaar!!i support this idea"
"i like this, but i think i prefer the global ban mentioned above."
"i can see them both working together actually, the main thing i'm reaching for is a very accessible way of countering the isk-sellers /rmt's."
"there are lot's of alliances, people etc. i don't like, but they have the right to vote just the same."
"there is a difference between mittani calling for the \"purge all infidels\" threadnaught last may and 1000 goons telling you that you're dumb. one is concerted, coordinated action, the other is a lot of people sharing an opinion with the means to express it. perhaps if you, oh great avatar of all things internety, understood that goons formed on the basis of an internet forum, you might realize why we all post so much. it's a slim hope, but a hope nonetheless.by the way, this idea sucks and so does the alt op."
"for amarr, gallente, and minmatar, on average 2/3 of their level 4 agents from the faction navy (federation navy, republic fleet, amarr navy) are in lowsec. caldari navy is almost exactly the opposite. i propose ccp balance this out by either bringing the other 3 factions in line with caldari navy or by shipping caldari agents to lowsec.personal choice: shift a few cal navy agents to lowsec."
"newsflash there is already ways around jita, tuntarras new caldari etc."
"then they should make it so that the route planning in the map avoids highly congested systems if they can be circumvented by only 1 or 2 jumps.edit: yeah, i'm lazy and don't plan my routes manually, especially when travelling in high sec. but i bet the majority of players out there is lazy like me."
"i'm divided on this. practically, it would help people that just need to travel through jita keep from getting stuck. but principally, it's a poor use of manpower to use static solutions to try and fix a dynamic problem.however, it shouldn't take too much effort, so i'll support it."
"depends on where you are coming from and going.the avoid crowded systems option for the autopilot would be nice as well so it's easier to plot a route around it."
"with the proliferation of capitals and supercapitals in 0.0 space and the faction warfare event going on, there should be the introduction of a new type of t2 battlecruiser, based upon the tier 2 bc hulls, and designed with the idea of being an anti-capital vessel.the main issues concerning such a ship would be as follows:1) it would have to be strong enough to pose a viable threat to capitals and supercapitals.2) it would have to not be that effective against sub-capitals else there's the risk a significantly overpowered 'do-everything' ship.3) it should not be a replacement for capitals, especially dreads, in various aspects of 0.0 warfare4) it should be a fairly reachable vessel, not too easy to get to, but also not too hard.with those ideas in mind, the suggestion would be for a new class of t2 battlecruisers. like many weapon systems throughout history, they are designed to be a cheap method of countering something big, and a popular way to do such in science fiction writing is through the use of spinal-mount weapons. this gives a ship the ability to carry what is effectively an oversized weapon for it's class, but due to the 'point the ship at the target' method of aiming, it carries the negative of being somewhat unwieldy.the nature of this weapon helps to address potential concerns about it being useful in more ways than it's intended role.overall ideas of the class:1) one heavy spinal-mount weapon. other weapons for 'self-defense' are possible as well (as per original hull)2) reduced mid and low slots to hinder it's tanking ability. they're semi-fragile weapons, not able to replace dreadnoughts.3) tier-2 racial resists so they're not too fragile.4) simpler requirements to train than command ships. still need bc v of course, but a light pre-req speciality skillbook that's easy to train to.overall ideas of the weapons:1) capital-ship sized signature. these things should not be hitting battleships easily.2) high damage so that they are a threat to dreadnoughts. enough damage/dps so that a small group can go through a dreadnought pretty quickly.3) very limited tracking ability. the ship itself would have to face the target to be able to strike it. is this even possible in eve?main concerns i see about the design:amarr and minmatar obviously would be energy weapons and projectile, but caldari and gallente pose a concern. a missile-style weapon would be caldari-like, but would circumvent the mobility disadvantage of these vessels by not having to be alligned with the target. give them rails instead and that means gallente has to either use blasters, or go with rails as well. and if gallente uses blasters, then that would give their vessel the shortest range of all types, significantly hindering their effectiveness.the overall idea is to help give non-capitals a better ability to engage capitals and provide a sense of 'reactionary development' to the game's introduction of new ships."
"good idea"
"i htink its a good idea, too"
"i can see your point, but i'm afraid it will replace dreads.point: around same damage as a dreads, but cheaper. :/"
"woot , no missiles. :(cannot vote yes for an entire type of ship with no missiles. :/"
"bad idea cap ships should be by thier very nature hard to kill."
"over all its a bad idea. battlecruisers of any kind shouldnt be doing much damage to capital ships, after all the only use medium sized guns. it just doesnt make sense and it would be abused, ie they would have to dish out insane dps, more manuverable than a bs as well as the cap ships not to mention alot of other stuff. you could almost do something with the tier 3 bs hulls and make them into an anti cap ship class, but it would still be taking away from other cap ships."
"i once had a similar idea, but mine was based on small very fragile ships, like frigates or co-ops...in essence, one would have have a gang of these, like 6 ships, then these ships would have the ability to activate a high slot module (rift module)that enables it to \"pair\" with the other 5 same ships wich would have to be close to each other like less than 3000m, this enabling it to build up an energyfield (rift)with it's counterparts.once this energy field charged (like after 30secs or so) it would immobilize the 5 ships, and the one pilot who activated his module first in the gang then would have the ability to target a capital ship and fire off a rift beam (imagine the beams the shadow battlecrabs had in babylon 5) this beam would be powerfull enough to break a capital tank with 1 shot.now that the principle is explained here are the tweakings:-these rift firgates would be very vulnerable and would have to be protected by support fleet.-once the rift module is activated it has to be fired, or the module overcharges and has a cooldown phase of 30 mins, before can be activated again.-the rift frigates would have very low sensor strength, so that only capital class ships could be targetted efficiently (locking a frig f.ex would take like 2mins or so, but locking a dread would go normal speed)-as said above already it needs to be a wing or gang of 6 rift frigs to be able to use the weapon.-once the rift module activated the group of rift frigs would get immobilized until the beam is fired, and thus giving the defending force \"the cruicial counterattack moment\", but if they miss that point, ...by by capital ship.think this would enable non capital pilots to take part in capital warfare and not make a ship that's a totally uber pawn machine that kills all types of ships.also this wepon would be totally useless in a pos sieging scenario to attack a tower cos pos guns could pop the rift frigs with a glimps of an eye.so dreads would still have their usefullness.my 2 cent on this issue"
"bc sized stealth bomber who uses citadel torps.can be used a little bit against some battleships but generally an anti-cap ship."
"what you're suggesting is essentially an up-sized stealth bomber. not a terrible idea, per se, but i'm not convinced it's necessary. also, no spinal mount weapons - this isn't wing commander, you can't aim your ship worth a damn in eve."
"their damage output would be fairly similar, but they wouldn't have anywhere near the ability to take damage as dreads, which is very important as well.comparing the ship type to stealth bombers is not quite fair. and the idea would be to make it so that they can't do any sort of decent damage to battleships.you can, all you have to do is approach your target. which makes you more vulnurable.it's not unheard of at all for weapon system to be designed that carry much more firepower than is typical for their size in exchange for a tradeoff, usually speed or mobility. the requirement for these guys to limit the amount of transversal between them and their target would make them relatively immobile targets. their dps would be high against their intended targets, but low for their class against anyone else."
"but why do we need this class in the game? what role is it going to fill?"
"badly needed, very urgent.no cons, only pros.pls pls pls..."
"check the forum history, will you?"
"would it be possible to make it so that the upgrade clone thing automatically removes all options below your current sp level? if you're not getting something higher than your current sp you might as well be in an alpha clone anyways."
"if there's no advantage to a better insufficient clone, then yes, remove the inferior ones. i'd prefer there be some advantage(you lose 5% of your unsaved sp, say?), but if they're not going to create that advantage then they should remove the ability to pay money for nothing - it has to have confused some n00b in highly unfortunate fashion at some point.edit: judging by the post below me, this is already the case. thus, i'm withdrawing my thumb - inadequate clones should be available if the game mechanics work like this."
"if you get podded and have an insufficient clone you loose 5% of the difference between the amount of sp you have and what the clone can hold. so it does make a difference.of course you normally don't want to use an insufficient clone. but you may not be able to afford what you need. and in that case it would be better to get something better than the alpha clone anyway.if the problem is that you accidentally purchase a lower clone then a warning might be useful. but to take away the possibility to get whatever clone you want is not a good idea."
"i propose the following procedures for csm meetings in order to make these meetings as effective as possible:invitation to meeting posted a minimum of 48 hours before meeting.a deadline of 24 hours before meeting to post agenda for the meeting, which will include all issues that are to be discussed and voted on, as well as the chosen moderator for the meeting (by default this is the chairman).all issues that a csm delegate wants added to the agenda of the next meeting must be sent to the chairman before the deadline of the agenda, as described above. any issues sent after the deadline will not be put on the agenda for the next meeting (the one in 24 hours or less), but rather the meeting thereafter.the first issue on the agenda will always be for the agenda to be accepted. if any csm delegate thinks that an issue was sent before the deadline, and yet is not on the agenda, he can propose to have this issue added. if any csm delegate thinks that the invitation to the meeting was sent out in violation of the proper procedures, he can propose to have the meeting cancelled.during the meeting, everyone will be given the right to speak when they ask for it, in the order that the ask for it. a csm delegate can ask for this right by posting a ! in the chat. it is the obligation of the moderator to give the delegates their right to speak in the correct order. the moderator must himself ask for this right if he is to talk on the issue, contrasted to moderating the meeting.muting is only allowed when a csm delegate speaks without having been given the permission by the moderator to do so. the moderator is obligated to inform the meeting when he has muted a delegate.if the moderator does not do his obligations as outlined above, the council can vote for changing the moderator. if this vote is not allowed by the moderator, the meeting is considered invalid.i expect the csm to do some minor changes in this proposition, if it is decided to be taken up in a meeting."
"/signed, at least what's there. i would structure it further, calling i \"participation\", ii through iv \"agenda\" and v to vii \"order\".then there's the need to consider everything else. a bit of brainstorming: - disconnections: failing to allow for isp issues is wrong imho. people should get their 5 minute chance to reconnect- publicality: there should be a requirement for logs to be accessible to the general public in real-time.actually, i'd expect the delegates to put this up themselves."
"much like in every other corp, there needs to be a general mail that goes out to everybody in the default faction corp and all the people who would normally get pos mails in corps who have signed up for their faction.what the mail should include:identify what complex is being assaulted.identify what system the complex is in.the time sent of the mail will time/date stamp it.what this would do:make systems have a some-what like reinforce mode. the militias have however long the time duration is for that complex from when the mail was sent to organize a fleet and repel the invaders. if they cant organize that fast, then they know which one to attempt to retake for defense. **this has come up several times in idle discussions in fleet about fw."
"can we get a faction warfare part of the forum"
"good idea"
"can you get a bit more specific?right now, i'm assuming that you're talking about an ic smacktalk forum where amarr can try to balance off their inferiority by living out their superiority complexes."
"what vizan and i mean is a forum for each militia where players can organize their own militia through standardized ts, corps, and ops, a forum would just help create some central leadership"
"i will support one forum, but not two or four, for reasons i already gave:there's just no way not to have your enemy gather intel on you if you use these forums."
"it's 8.0 right now, which is quite high, especially if you contrast it with the requirements for militia membership and the fact that fw is intended to be low-barrier (and, thus imho also angst) pvp.options include lowering the req itself and/or having the militia offering \"cheap\" clones to ensure proper dedication by their members.signing this means agreeing to make jump clones more publicly available, in whatever way."
"i'll agree with looking at militia corps offering jumpclones somehow(i could even be really crazy and suggest that you could get them via lp store), but the barrier shouldn't be lowered in general."
"all you're asking for is an i-win button.a ship that can be dropped in a fleet of 100 and not worry about the outcome is bad and will only attracked blobs.an anti-blob ship with a massive tank will only result in bigger blobs..."
"now now, dont hate. this isnt an aweful idea. what i think of when i see this is a an anti-support dread. instead of a siege module which makes volly high, buffs tank, and kills locktime we have something which buffs rof, range, locktime. or something approximating that heh. said ship should have less of that races tank slots than either carrier or dread so that it's much more vulnerable.so it's not all bad, worth discussing at least."
"certainly not supported.anyone with a cyno jammer and ships with the purpose stated above would become even more unassailable than they are now with multiple titan support. two thumbs down"
"it might now be as awful as titans sporting remote doomsdays(or doomsdays at all), but its almost there."
"quoted for truth."
"carriers and moms already do that as well as titans"
"waaah i crawled up asses and nobody cares.actually, the single most democratic processes are random selection, followed by public vote. the thing you're proposing is autocraty disguised as philanthropism."
"the position was open to anyone.even if ccp approaches players, the end result is the same: those who want to participate do so, those who don't, don't, with the playerbase votes thrown in to somehow decide the result.out of those who were interested, you got what you voted for, now live with it. ccp can't make anyone do anything they don't want to do.reasons why someone might refuse to participate:- don't want to reveal rl name and info to all of you internet strangers- don't want to do secretarial work for free / no benefits- don't want to be taken advantage of in a pr stunt- don't care about trips to iceland- just want to play the game, nothing moreit's nice that you want others to step in and do a better job, but, you know, if you want something done right..."
"to help organization, need i say more?"
"i oppose this. if ever, they would have to be unlocked by militia membership, which raises the alt problem and thus nobody would ever use them.i bet there will be player-hosted boards for elders in time, where long-time and mutually trusting people can discuss things in calm. i don't think ccp should in any way even try to influence the way people meta-game."
"sorry. unsupported.i imagine many players have alot of capital invested in the tech 1 bpos in order to produce the command ships. changing the base ship to appease an aesthetic considerations is extremely inconsiderate to those investing in tech 2 production.the recent covert-ops change is imho a fiasco.if you wish to make use of the tier ii models and other under utilized tech 1 models then make new tech 2 ship types.dont screw over those of us who enjoy the current models or have invested in thier production by arbitrary changing them."
"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.i am a mission runner myself but i see this in \"ninja salvager's\" lightninja salvager are limited by the following:-can't tractor wreaks-limited to after burners-requires dedicated mods to be effective-requires many skills to be effective-time consuming with no guarantee of a steady income -income dictated by mission runners-not viable in low sec and null sec-weak and subjected to aggros by npcsmission runners can adapt by:-side step salvager by just simply moving.

"i've rethought my original suggestion some. they need fairly similar base speed and mass as their t1 counterparts (not 25% slower and 50+% heavier) and a fourth skill which always goes to buffing damage. for ishkur, the typical 10% to drone hp/damage per level. for enyo, an extra 5% damage to small hybrids per level. and so on. that'd put them into the heavy tank/damage dealing frigate role. and with the same speed and maneuverability as frigates, they couldn't touch interceptors for their role and would put them more into the 'cruiser-killing frigate' role they were supposedly introduced to. if ccp really wants to keep their speed gimped (although hacs are faster than cruisers in every way), then at least make them able to match the speed of frigates if both the af and frigate's full set of lows were devoted to overdrive iis."
"did you vote for a csm candidate now elected, and if you did, do you regret it now?"
"i shall be the first(if not only) person to admit that he hasn't regretted voting for the person he voted for()"
"are you joking?jade did a great job providing me with all these goon tears. i love the csm forums. caod was getting a bit boring as of lately."
"i voted for jade because he was the only one with a vision of the game i really liked. if i'd known how much of a walking drama bomb he was going to be, i probably would have looked a bit harder for second-best, but i'm not convinced yet as to whether i'd have voted otherwise given the option. i will, however, be sure to look people's forum histories up more thoroughly next time when i'm picking who to vote for."
"on a serious note: yes, i voted for jade primarily because i happen to agree with the general ideas of his manifesto and because he's a damn good communicator, but i'd be lying if say that i didn't foresee great opportunities for drama especially with an organization like goonswarm."
"hahahahahahahahahahahahaha"
"i wish we could cast a vote of no confidence. jade really crossed the line."
"wall of text"
"i voted for hardin, and he's one of very few doing what he actually should be.so yeah... i'm not regretful in the slightest."
"voted hardin. i'm still happy with my vote."
"voted bane.i haven't seen enough to call him great but he's one of the best on the council. i am not unhappy with my choice."
"i'm severely disappointed in the turnout of our csms to this thread, and the others like it. do they feel threatened by the goons? do they feel threatened by jade? do they feel impotent? the fact of the matter is, this is a huge topic that a lot of the voting public feels strongly in. jade is dismissing it as trolling or a threadnought or a goon conspiracy, but even csms other than darius and bane feel differently than jade does. i've yet to see the majority of our csms respond to the claims that have been put forward.by the way, isn't posting this the duty of the secretary?"
"that is jade politicking to act like it's the best man/woman/thing for the job after what went down this week. if he can't have absolute power he'll take it in small portions, including discounting 50% of the eve playerbase by giving a giant tt to the us players."

"do you mean jade?"
"yes i did my appologies"
"on the issue of whether or not email conversations should be private or public, it is understandable that people draw real-world parallels, as this is an obvious connection to make.however, as several players and fellow council members like to remind everyone, this is an internet space game and as such, lacks the equivalent communication channels that rl provides for a group of people physically located in one place.it strikes me as a little poorly thought out to assume that all communication should therefor be made public, when there is no online equivalent of meeting in the halls of government, untapped phone conversations and a walk in the park or golf. for such an equivalent online, we could arguably use voice communications instead, however there is a matter of simply being able to respect the need for other non-recorded forms of communication (via email or private forum) and with that respect not require twisting and bending to find alternative channels. last i looked, every council member agreed unanimously for a closed private forum.while it may be scatelogically amusing to read every time farts into a chat log, it is not productive to providing community focus on dealing the with real issues the csm is meant to deal with. i would far rather have 200 people posting up in arms about a suggested nerf than 2000 people posting about a petty argument over the colour csm should have when they type in local. not in the least part because it would not reward csm members with fame and forum scoring points for wasting everyones time with relatively unimportant matters, but only for dealing with the key issues players face."
"i guess i'll have to agree to disagree. i learned a long time ago to never say anything on the internet that i wouldn't want everyone in the world to read. it's a valuable lesson. there are two schools of thought to this obviously...the first is that the council for some reason needs a line of private communications beyond their own personal mailboxes. why would this private line of communication need to exist? so people could say things they didn't want the voters to see? for what cause? because they're embarassed by their actions or don't want to be held accountable for them? that is an idea i simply find abhorrent. publishing your communications isn't a means for anyone to \"score political points\" if you haven't said anything you wouldn't want anyone to see.i take the perspective that we are public figures and should act as such. if you can't keep from acting like a jerk in your communications with the other representatives why should the players not be able to see that? if good and hard work is going on outside of the meetings and a good dialogue is being had why should the players not be able to see that? if you have a reason for supporting or not supporting an issue and state it why should the players not be able to see that?really the only reason i can conceive for not wanting council discussions conducted via email (the only other medium used right now aside from the meetings) to be public is that you feel you have something to hide. all of the reasons i've seen to support this have involved the need for people to \"be able to save face\". save face from whom?i'm sorry but this is a public council having public discussions about issues that are the public's concern. they have every right to know what is being said about issues. they have every right to know what edicts are being given. they have every right to know if the person they voted for is really supporting their issues and living up to the standards the voters applied to them when they were elected.i posit that anyone who feels they can not handle that scrutiny has something to hide. i don't think it's the business of the council to hide. we're not a shadow government."
"to address the last paragraph... i'm sure you would rather people are concerned with the issues. who are we to force that on the population? do you honestly think that by operating behind a curtain we're going to control behavior? that's not our job. i think it bears repeating that if you don't want people posting about a petty argument don't have one. i don't think it's a viable alternative to self control to have said petty argument in private and put on another face in public. you are correct that this is not real world politics. by that same token this shouldn't be treated with the same broken and falsely insulating shells of secrecy.:edit: you are not a king or leader of eve. it is not your position to increase or improve the morale of the general public. some people will like the csm. others won't regardless. i'd posit that if you want the csm to be respected then it should be open and good work should be accomplished. the majority will appreciate that.need i remind you that secrecy is against the very nature of this council which was created initially as a means to \"open up the doors of ccp and look inside\". the very nature of this council is transparency as a founding principle of it's creation by ccp, at least according to their statements in international publications. this council is supposed to open doors, not create an additional layer of opaqueness."
"i can see both sides of it, and at the base level i agree with darius about the \"don't say anything you wouldn't want made public\". but at the same time i think there's a danger to every conversation and exchange being more performance than substance, something that i think has been far too much a part of some of the earlier meetings.there are many situations in life where a dispute can be resolved by a private conversation between two people - but when that conversation is public record it presents an obstacle to compromise between strong personalities \"on stage\" as it were."
"in no way am i suggesting that two people cannot have a private conversation and in no way, as i've said repeatedly but has been repeatedly misconstrued and twisted, does my motion prevent that. my aim is for all group communications of the council, all debates, all edicts, all suggestions and thoughts that are sent to all to be made public. if it's good enough to be communicated to the entire council then it's good enough to be shared with the subscribers. part of the problem here is that we're using an email list for what a forum should be used for. i'd be just as happy to have a forum which is read only to the public whereby all council communications can occur.at the end of the day i'm not hung up on \"scoring political points\" as some detractors are trying to suggest. i have my votes. i don't need to score points. if we hold another election tomorrow i'd be elected in a heartbeat. that entire argument is silly on its face. i believe that by keeping group communications, edicts, debates and any other group communications veiled in shadow we're merely perpetuating the problem the council was created to address by creating the perception of a separate elite class. this will only create the same distrust with the public that was the cause of the problem in the first place.:edit: ccp created this council to remove the veil. in the words of ccp's ceo \"i envision this council being made up of nine members selected by the players themselves, where you announce your candidacy, and if you win the election, they come here to iceland, and they can look at every nook and cranny and get to see that we are here to run this company on a professional basis, said mr. petursson, ccps chief executive. they can see that we did not make this game to win it.\"that quote is from a ny times article located here:"
"i'm with you on that, i meant to go on to say it just depends where you draw the line with what's public and what's private. that's a good rule of thumb."
"damn you and your sensible ways, god damn you all to hell!"
"deleted. darius, let's just agree to disagree, as i don't think that this debate will ever come to an end, and submission to ccp of issues is more important to focus on right now."
"i won't argue what darius initially wanted. the focus is on what he ended up wanting and how he feels now.windjammer"
"hey you put your internet psychic hat back on! you have no idea what i've ever wanted or how i've ever felt. let's not be silly. i know it's a stretch."
"no, not really that much of a stretch. it's based upon posting inside goonswarm. you remember. instructions to your bees on how to vote? splitting the vote between you and bane? that sort of information. remember that? also based upon your prima donna antics in csm meetings.i know it seems like magic to you (or a psychic trick), but it's not.windjammer"
"well you see the thing is we had an internal vote from about a dozen or so candidates that ended up with darius/bane as the top 2 choices and it was decided we would split the vote between the top 2 candidates which just happened to be the two of them. it could have been a number of different people in these positions.what prima donna antics? you mean standing up to the chair when he is abusing his power?"
"doh!"
"a quick question? what the hell are you voting on? how can you \"support\" if a template document has been filled out?\" didn't you already vote on this stuff?"
"we were voting on the multi-part issues which were voted in last time, provided that they were split into more than 1 issue in order to ease discussion.so we voted on if we could support the specific topic of each issue."
"i just want to thank everybody who turned up yesterday. it was a most excellent job in my eyes.thanks for being so patient despite how many issues we had to vote about.hopefull the rest of our meetings will go like that!"
"well i can answer that. each issue didn't have a discussion thread, you couldn't.point of note on the meeting as i read it:inanna you are wrong about the market. the highest buy order and lowest sell order that is possible to be filled always gets the item/isk when you well. no matter if you select a different order to fill or not.iirc this is currently done to prevent money laundering where an isk buyer buys a bunch of isk then buys something on the market for an exorbitant price listed by an alt. the seller of the item could then claim \"i just listed it at an exorbitant price there is no way i could have known the isk was bought\". this is to prevent that."
"good job chairing the meeting lavista vista. is this permanent or is there a rotating chairmanship now?"
"hopefully"
"gordon brown never made a hobby out of pretending to be a prostitute (that we know of.)"
"ikeep hearing this but i can buy any order i want.and if not then there is a way around this, lets say there are two sellorders one for 100,000isk with 2 in stock the other at 50,000 isk with 10 in stock. i buy the 100,000 isk one and put in 10 to buy.i press buy.i check market the 2 are still there at 50,000 i spent 1 million isk."
"the reason i was leading debate was because i was raising the issues in question.but maybe that is a good thing, that it is kinda rotating in a sense? so each time we have a new person on the block to moderate the debate. i like that idea. judging from yesterday, it could even work too!very interesting idea. we should talk about it, certainly!"
"yep i think a rotating chair is a great idea. share the admin load and give everyone a chance to do a bit of running meetings. excellent stuff."
"re the chatlogs - i'm not all the way through them yet, but i caught a line about how ccp won't let you abstain. what's the deal with that? yeah, but he's like paul martin without the personality. i'll take a bit of good old-fashioned eccentric sexual roleplay over the horrific reality of boring politicians of the centre-left."
"no, you can buy at any price, and sell at any price you want, but not any order. the item will come from the person with the lowest sell or highest buy order, 100% of the time, all the time."
"well, i don't think it's as much ccp allowing us to abstain. they just never intended it to be an option.but in questions like this, it's simple. the options for voting are:escalate issuedeny escalation of issueit can thus be argued that there is no middle-way and that representatives should want one of above to be true.i think there is some matters where abstaining is viable. but thus far i see no reason to abstain.so i don't think it's ccp's intention to now allow us. they just had in mind that either you voted yes or no.but ccp wants us to shape the council. so we could raise an issue and discuss if this should be changed."
"okay, finished. i'm amazed - you managed to have a drama-free meeting. there had better be beer and videocamers in iceland, because i peace on the csm is just wrong somehow. and inanna, you're wrong - you invariably buy from the cheapest order in the station, no matter which price you pay. i got burned hard by this one when i was about a week into the game(lost my whole 3 million isk wallet) and i haven't forgotten it since. i see abstention as mostly an \"i have no idea how that section of the game works, so i don't want to fool around with it too much\" vote in practice - i know there's a few issues i'd abstain on, and if someone as opinionated as me is willing to shut up, it's probably a good idea to let me"
"great meeting imo.i hope everyone involved thought so also.now what was differant about this one meeting and the other 3?anyway, great job and thank you."
"serenity's absence seriously? a week of forum drama nobody wanted to repeat, combined with a total lack of procedural issues, controversial issues, and controversial procedural issues. also, i don't think the first two went all that badly, either."
"ccp mandated that abstaining is an option.read the documents. they have formally said that the system uses \"simple majority\", not \"absolute majority\". what this means is that all votes are what are known as plurality votes.yesnoabstain.you look at the results of all 3, and if there are more ayes than naes, then the vote wins. if more naes than ayes the vote fails. where its contentious, is what happens when there are more abstains. an abstain is neither a yes , nor a no. so in simple majority, you look at if there are more yes's than no's and you don't count abstains as no's. if you count them as naes, its called \"absolute majority\", because in absolute majority the rule is \"you need 50% aye for the motion to succeed\" rather than \"more ayes than naes\". the reason why its contentious is if the majority of votes are abstains. does this mean that that the vote is rejected, or does it mean that the vote is undecided. normal political theory says that because its a plurality voting system (3 or more options), the vote remains undecided. this does match what common sense would suggest that \"if most people can't decide, it hasn't really been discussed enough yet\". but sometimes it just means that the motion is killed because its too divisive.either way, to be a \"simple majority\" system, you must have the option to abstain, else it is not simple majority, but rather absolute majority.if you count abstains as no's, then you are not following ccps instructions in the csmsummary document which state the method must be used."
"no. an email from ccp, which i of course can't show you, suggests otherwise.abstain wasn't intended."
"where were the goons? is it a coincidence that they were silent/absent and the meeting ran smoothly?"
"yeah it was totally a coincidence that the meeting was scheduled during american work hours"
"its not as if they said in this very thread (which isn't too long to skim either) that they wouldn't be there."
"blame ccp for putting the submission date during a work day"
"that's kind of a cheap shot.first two meetings ran relatively smoothly and goons participated effectively in them. from my perspective the reason this meeting ran a lot smoother than the infamous 'third' was a general acceptance that we need to focus on the gameplay issues and a more relaxed attitude from those running the meeting.all in all a good result!"
"could have delayed it 1-2 hours..."
"no goumindong. that would mean that for the majority of the council it would have been past midnight. since the majority of the council and eve works in gmt, it would be bad to move it back 2 hours.also due to the fact we have a submission deadline. 2 hours would make a huge difference in regards to that."
"i'd see it entirely on ccp for the exclusion of non-europeans from the meeting. the fact this had to happen during the week is going to be exclusive for at least one timezone. in the future these things should only happen during weekends to allow for everyone to be present. what happens in the future, when/if some antipodeans get elected is only going to further highlight this issue. ccp should nip it in the bud now."
"so instead of staying up for a few more hours you deny the ability of two players and an alternate to attend?staying up 2 more hours is not a big deal. ditching work is."
"i hate to disagree with the standard take by the e-lawyers, but generally when writing club constitutions, \"simple majority\" is opposed by 2/3 majority, not by an absolute majority. mind you, it's a simple majority of votes cast - serenity's \"abstain = no\" position is absurd - but the rule to ban abstentions is \"no abstentions\", it isn't \"simple majority\", since that phrase just means 50%+1."
"ironically it turned out that there was an appendix written for the original documents that explicitly stated that there was no abstention facility in voting on issues - as lavista said the options were:support escalation, deny escalation.in order for an agenda issue to reach the conference shortlist it needs a majority of \"support\" votes from the those present. 5 for 8/9 - 4 for 7. and essentially serenity was right. in this system you can't abstain and unless you are registering a \"support\" vote you are effectively saying \"no\".that said, i certainly don't blame anyone on the csm or indeed anyone in the voting electorate for being confused on these issues, we're discovering these principles bit by bit in discussion and asking for clarification and its a bit playing pass the parcel with new ideas and interpretations hidden underneath each layer of wrapping paper.main thing i think all of us (csms and forum public) can do is deal with this process with a few more philosophical shrugs and good humor. lets not jump to conclusions and accusations. its a bit of a mr slippies wild ride of adventures at the moment and we're discovering new things each week. all the best."
"nice work reps, that meeting looked like it went very smoothly."
"yeah well done guys, i skimmed the log quickly, the whole thing looked cordial enough. feels like the creases are getting ironed out.heh, the trials of being pioneers"
"i was disappointed that the issues presented were hardly split at all. poor issues were voted through simply by being lumped in with good ones, even though some representatives expressed concern for 'wooliness' and bad issues.this can not happen again. all issues must be presented seperately on the forums for debate and discussion, and a vote taken on each issue, not a bunch of issues under a topic. many of those issues that are now going to ccp are very poor, affect a small amount of eve players, and have not been explored further to see that they will have negative ramifications on the whole.this undermines the percieved effectiveness of the csm, both in the players eyes and ccp eyes. present issues seperately on forums (this is not an issue that needs voting on- its an underlying implication in the csm documents).you effectively votes 4 times for 60+ issues...very poor indeed.bruce hansen"
"passing votes omnibus is acceptable if someone doesn't have an issue with the issues in the package but when they do they are supposed to be broken out. its obvious to me these people haven't read how to actually hold a meeting of this nature or they would know this."
"bruce,once again you prove to me you have no idea at all what you are talking about. since you havent seemed to even read the chat logs which described the 6 issues it was split into, nor have you seen the submission templates, you would notice that your logic is totally broken.there isn't 60 issues in total. i had to cut large parts of it away because of the huge overhead with voting and submission templates. so bruce, how can this undermine the effectiveness of csm in both the players and ccp eyes? you aren't ccp. i actually talked to ccp and the original 60+ issue document was no problem. we could have submitted it and it would have been fine. but it was the council's wish to split it into more sizeable chunk. and since you haven't proved to me that you know what you are talking about, i suggest that you stop throwing around wrong assumption and start getting a grasp of reallity. unless you can prove further that your assumptions are right, i think you should watch what you accuse people of before you start posting."
"jade,i cannot find the issue of mid sized freighters listed in your op, according to what i read in the meeting chatlog this issue was supported by all members present at that meeting.has this issue been dropped from the points being taken to ccp for some reason? if so why?"
"it went through at the third meeting (i between all the fun) and should be on iceland agenda"
"i own the small freighter issue. the issue was submitted to the agenda on the 12th. but i think it might have been missed.i will figure out what happened. hold on."
"[lawyer]\"simple majority\" is >50%. in cases with small voting bodies 50% +1 would require more than a simple majority. e.g. 9 votes are cast, 5 yes, 4 no. 50% of 9 is 4.5. 50%+1 is 5.5. the measure fails because 5.5 votes were not cast in favor.[/lawyer]"
"i think its just a case of me mucking up and forgetting it on the op post i'm afraid. lavista has the issue. he'll submit it directly to ccp with our apologies and we'll our best to get it on the agenda in iceland. sorry about that. (i'm going to edit it into the op now with an explanation)"
"the issue was overseen during the indexation of all issues. we will be submitting it as soon as possible in hope that ccp has a bit of goodwill."
"originally by: arithron yes, lavista needs to write 60+ topics for the threads, and the other representatives also. that's the rules you were elected under, that's what you have to do. this gives players a chance to discuss/debate each issue and for the representatives to do likewise, both on the forums and in the meetings. it also allows for the important vote on each issue seperately.take care,bruce hansen okay i've asked lavista and the other candidates with multiple item issues via our internal mailing list to come and respond to you specifically here arithron. i hope you'll either come to a rational compromise on the issue or i'll advise that they need to be split out. okay? give tomorrow for some discussion and i'll make a call in the evening.cntd..."
"ill also help you out a little and quote a section from the csm documents:after each csm member presents their opinion to support or disprove a motion, the matter is brought to vote; a majority rule passes the issue for escalation. all csm deliberations are to be documented by the secretary, including the reasons for supporting or denying the measure.the key question that council members must consider before casting their vote is whether or not the issue at hand has the potential to improve or otherwise benefit the entire eve society, and not just a select group within the community that was successful in bringing attention to their unique case.what you have is a lot of issues lumped together under some topic headings. its clear that csm members vote and discuss each issue (highlighted above), not topics with multiple issues.it would also be good to be able to see the council reasons for supporting the measures.may i remind you politely that i am not hiding behind a character here in these forums. i find your responses to me insulting and belittling and bordering on inflammatory. im politely asking you to stop being personal and follow this guidance from the csm document:representatives are not only expected to uphold the social contract that all society members are held accountable to, but should also set a behavior standard for everyone else to follow.take care,bruce hansen"
"qft. you could save typing by copy/pasting that quote onto many thread."
"it was my understanding that a few players have these items on tranq already as a result of some award/rp stuff similar to the opux luxury yacht(s) and a few other special it would be nice to see if they could share the love, but the cost would be a bit prohibitive for newer players. also having them go to a small faction like the soceity of conscious thought would make them even more expensive. anyone seen a nomad (thukker) implant for sale? the thukker even have empire stations yet it costs over 2 billion isk for a set of low grades."
"it's not about giving old players a new toy, like a new skill intensive ship type, it's about increasing the rate at which the gap between older and newer players widens.better implants -> even more sp per hour than new player can hope to attain.it's basically the same problem that there is with learning skills, it does not only rewards older players (which would be fine) but increases the speed at which they distance themselves from newer players sp wise."
"with so many ideas being posted and support for them mounting, i can see how the current approach of these ideas by csm is not going to work. some of the more popular ideas are discussed by the csm in meeting and then either thrown out or supported. but since a lot of them actually end up getting support (they're good ideas after all), the csm risks ending up with a list the size of the features and ideas forum that won't be of any use to ccp. perhaps the csm had better start thinking about ways to prioritize or generalize over this mess..."
"what we really need are some kind of forum management tools i think. once an issue thread has gotten csm advocacy and been raised at the council it could do with being locked or moved to some kind of archive sub forum. it would also be nice to be able to see visually from the index which threads have been supported. but these forum-wish lists are already on our agenda and dierdra vaal composed a letter full of things we'd like to see done in this respect, while ank has advocated a specific issue around the problems with the current forum software. just have to hope ccp forum programmers can be convinced to work on this stuff really."
"if they're used like jade said - to push off items that have been dealt with - then they're not prone to that kind of abuse. nobody's opposed to getting threads that have been passed out of the way of new stuff."
"ah no, they can be too easily abused."
"one should remember that the 'popular' idea is not necessarily the 'good' idea, and vice versa.however you have a point that a way of 'marking out' good ideas could have a use to sort through the deluge."
"214 responses / 99 votes / 3823 viewsof which, 19 are votes from pvt alliance, and who knows how many of their alts. which would be naturally biased especially when told to vote for such a topic.also lots of opposition to your topic vs mostly unanimous voting in other topics, i'd say they are doing well.except 4 and 8, which surprisingly are being pushed, while jade supported both of them."
"i read that proposal and thought it died a natural death. seemed to me that a lot more people were of a different opinion than the op as far as what constituted ownership. honestly, i thought it was a troll that just went away.windjammer"
"this idea was passed on in the meeting #4 thread after a very pleasent meeting. the general consensus was that the very good order during the meeting could be attributed to the change in moderator troughout the meeting.it was thus suggested to look into making the chair rotating to some degree.the way i see it viable is this way:when an issue is raised the owner of the issue will take over moderation duties. all issues should thus have assigned an owner in advance. eventually it could be agreed on by the council in advance whom should take moderation ownership of \"neutral\" issues.the chairman that was elected should act as the \"overall\" moderator to make sure things go as planned. things can get out of hand, even for the moderator at any given issue. thus it's important that there is a fail-over moderator, should it be the case that the discussion gets overheated without action taken on the part of the moderator at any given time.this means we have 2 layers of moderation. remember we aren't talking about things like muting here. in this case it's largely to do with making sure there is progress in the discussion and keeping the order of business.what do you guys think? i think this could be a crucial step in order for the council to work as a team. so i would really love to see this be looked upon."
"not wanting to nitpick on a generally good idea here, but wouldn't this lead to haggling about who should own which issue?"
"that is a good point. most issues are raised by specific members. so in those cases, it won't be an issue.the only scenario i can see it being the case in issues which were picked by jade as being the most supported topics. those issues doesn't have an owner per say. jade could be considered the owner though, worst case scenario."
"whatever you guys think would work best is good by me. if ownership is a big deal, split them up on your mailing list in advance."
"you seemed to handle chairing the fourth meeting pretty well and i was genuinely impressed with how you guys handled yourselves. it gave me hope that this whole thing can be salvaged. i'd say the rotation is a great idea as long as sanctions are brought to bear on people who abuse the chair and i think that should be determined by ccp. apart from that, great idea."
"this is an excellent idea.as for chosing it. why not just say \"battleships, primaries are in alphabetical order!\" and go a-z."
"i dont see jade putting up with this after the showing of his true colors a while back. good luck, but ive lost faith. i think the moderator should be a forum moderator, or a member of isd."
"i like the idea a lot as it happens. i'm very much for splitting up the role of in-meeting moderation so we all know how it works and the csm introducing an issue gets describe it, call for debate, answer questions, and decide when to call for a vote. i think this worked superbly in meeting 4 and i'll be suggesting it again for meeting 5. as far as i'm concerned the less time we spend on procedural wrangling the better for everyone involved."
"ah, my faith is being restored in this one."
"works for me. want me to chair the next meeting and give jade a break?(assuming i can recover my eve playing computers epic fail)"
"works for me, i'm completely cool with that"
"ordering by alphabetical order is one of the most disgusting undemocratic things i have ever had the misfortune to see in real life. i'd rather not see it in game too."
"i personally have no problem with any chair or moderator provided people are able to speak without being subject to censorship. i don't mean spamming *farts farts farts* but i also don't agree with heavy handedness such as slapping someone for disagreeing and saying so. v0v i think this idea is just ducky provided everyone conducts themselves in a reasonable fashion."

"what he said."
"setting up pos's is quite possibly the most soul destroying thing i have ever done in a game to date. i didn't login for days afterwards because when i did the pos was going to be sitting there mocking me."
"the way someone could possibly disagree with this is to have never set up a pos before."
"no, it's in favor of carebearification.if putting up pos is easier it will mean that pos spam is also easier. 0.0 wars should be more about pvp and less about pos spam."
"i would agree with you twd, but ccp put a hard limit on the number of towers you can erect in a system. while i am not in favor of superior defenses springing up instantly on a tower the manual time in terms of sitting and doing nothing should be reduced. this of course ignores the mind numbing time wasted on industrial towers. this issue merits review. being able to set up a configuration in queue (for example) would make the life hating experience of tower setup more tolerable."
"i don't know about any hard limit ;) there is only a 5 pos per day limit as far as i know!"
"are you seriously suggesting that the best way to make pos spam unviable is to make it unenjoyable? this is a video game, the object of which is to entertain above all else."
"nah, i'm saying that making the placement of pos easier than it is now (and making pos spam more viable) is bad for pvp in 0.0if it's unenjoyable for you then i suggest to place less pos."
"so i'm guessing you didn't read the op, then?"
"yeah, it happens to be that i read the op fully. (this time)"
"so how about you tell me why any of the arguments i've raised are incorrect? there are better ways to reduce pos spam than to make it soul-destroyingly tedious."
"pos spam needs to be addressed in its own right and keeping them so horribly boring and tedious to put up is not a solution."
"the queuing idea makes the most sense to me. yes, setting up or changing the configuration of a pos should take significant amounts of time to complete but the soul-destroying tedium is completely unnecessary. i think almost anyone who has set up a deathstar or 12 would agree."

"i stay away from these things because they scare me"
"i can see the point twd is making - if you make something easier, more people do it. easier pos spamming _will_ make for more pos spamming.however this is something i don't think it's right to fix in this way. making a mechanic 'balance' via being annoying, or massively tedious, or laggy i don't think is right, in terms of game design. it just means people do it, and hate it instead.i would like to see 'pos spamming' become a different part of territorial warfare. but that's straying off topic.i'd suggest: queuing anchoring and onlining of mods.anchoring having some impact on what level of parallelism you can do.

"the exact values do need a bit of discussion, but i wholeheartedly support this. clone-jumping once every twenty-four hours can be awfully restrictive, and a means of reducing that would make a number of people happy.i do prefer \"reduces jump clone turnaround time by 10% per level\" over \"two hours per level\" just because almost everything else in eve is based on percentages, so it looks and feels a bit more internally consistent.numbers (based on 10% per level):aip 0: 24 hoursaip 1: 21 hours, 36 minutesaip 2: 19 hours, 12 minutesaip 3: 16 hours, 48 minutesaip 4: 14 hours, 24 minutesaip 5: 12 hours eventhe first couple levels don't get you much of anything (a couple hours), but aip3 is close to \"jump into an implant clone before you go to bed, sleep, go to work the next day, get home from work, jump back into a combat clone, kill stuff, repeat.\" aip 4 and aip 5 make that quite feasible.this could lead to a bit of overall inflation of characters' skill points. my implant clone is full of relatively expensive bits, in a station far removed from any of my alliance's current combat operations, so jumping into that clone effectively removes me from combat for the next 24 hours. if it were easier to do so (without the implicit penalty of \"you can't play eve tomorrow\") i know i'd be jumping quite a bit more often once i had this proposed skill trained up to iii or iv. a few hours with +3s and +4s would give me an extra few hundred skill points a day, which would add up over the next year or two.i don't have a problem with that, but some folks might."

"chribba is god! and god must have capital miners on his ship!!and the lasers should twinkle with glitter! to make them even more uber!"
"i approve this idea however what i would really like to see is something that is a capital ship, mines more than the hulk, and is much bigger and tougher than the hulk. perhaps instead of lasers, it fires chains at asteroids and slowly drags them to an onboard grinder mechanism. the asteroids would take a bit of time to reach the ship (200 m/s perhaps) but when they do, they would be instantly ground to a pulp!"
"i completely disagree with your idea in its current form. i would rather have it changed in one of these forms:(1) create a skill that allows a 2 second delay in when you appear in local per level. at lvl 5 it would give a 10 second delay. and(2) create a ship that hides you from local for an additional 30 seconds. however, this ship would be the equivilent of a shuttle but the size of a cruiser (all that built in anti-local electronics are heavy!) with no offense, no defense and no way to cloak. it would only be a scout."
"let me illuminate for the more dimwitted folk in this thread. people are proposing that constellation, not local. is the main channel. that is, the 4-6 systems around you will all condense into one large \"local\". this means if a hostile in in the constellation you won't be able to tell where he is, however you'll see gatecamps long before you arrive to them and also you'll see hostiles approaching more often than you would. your reaction time goes up as you see them father out, but their actual location is obfuscated. blackops will gain purpose for bridging past gatecamped systems without them being sure if you've actually done it. ratters will see that large gain inbound or even gatecamps ahead in the pipe depending on how the constellation is formed.this isn't a single faceted fix or nerf. both sides will take a hit but gain from it. overall i believe the game gains more than is restricted by this."
"no support. local is fine just the way it is. i won't bother to offer reasons for this. your own goumindong (post 29 on page 1 of this thread) states the case well.i will simply add that the change you propose benefits hunting packs at the expense of miners, haulers and mission runners. your assumption that defending pvper's would want to hang around these people on the off chance of intercepting pirates, etc, is self serving absurdity and would rarely happen save perhaps in the case of a large corp and/or alliance. oh...look.....you're in a large corp and/or alliance. what a surprise.what's next? nerfing cloaks?this is at least the second time this week that i've found myself in agreement with goumindong and it's ****ing me off. please coordinate your communications within goonswarm to avoid this in the future. thank you.windjammer"
"i absolutely and fully believe this would be the single best change to the eve interface available (and i'm almost never in local low-sec/0.0)"
"if you listen to anything goumindong says you're an idiot."
"this, i didn't even think his post deserved a reply."
"agreed with the principle of altering local, even if not necessarily exactly as the op suggest."
"this has many pro's and cons.from a pvp standpoint it can be both, the ability to move a sizable fleet practically undetected, the con is the poor sods getting blobbed.con, chinese farmers will find it easier to farm with little risk of detection , pro more secure transports through low sec.etc, im sure we could carry on, atm i cant think of any way to balance things but i will have a think more on it"
"dont completely remove it, instead modify it, here is my idea.everyship will have a new kind of \"local\" scanner that will automaticaly shows player names (except cloaked ones, see below) in the system, much like local. these scanners will have something like 20au range (a random number) in low sec and null sec.make it so that cloaked ships shows as \"unidentified flying object\". this way you'll know there is a cloaked ship, but you wont know who it is. cloaked ships should also have a scanning penalty (like -50% to -75% penalty on system scans) so they wont be overpowered.if someone types something into local, they basically broadcasts a message across the solar system, this way the chat function also protected.make it so that every station and stargate has an inherent 100au range (again, a random number) in high sec that will give the system info between each other and then, to players, like an information web. this will ensure local will stays as more or less same in high sec as it is today.thats my 2 isks."

"you're telling me that the 30m/s that a tempest has over other battleships compensates for having ridiculous weapon systems? autocannons don't have the best dps, or range, or ammo usage... they're only used by amarrians because they can't figure out how to use lasers effectively with a tank . weakest is fine, whatever, but at least set it in line. maybe you should visit the 10+ page thread between liang and goumindong on why 1400s are outdone in every way. capless means virtually nothing anyway.anyway, op supported as artillery is currently crap.astro"

"i support the upgrade of the 1400mm arties. the biggest issue as i see it is the amount of bullets in clip that are way lower than the other weapon types. i would suggest increase the clip size so that it can take more shots per clip ( i don't know if this is the right terminology- i mean to increase the amount of shots before reloading-actually doubling it)another suggestion could be to increase the amount of bullets per clip only by 50% of current, decrease rof and increase the damage to make the alpha more significant maintaining the same dps in the long run.ps i suggest this for all large arties"
"as if missing battleships that are moving at 100 ms at 100km range just because of the worthless tracking wasn't depressing enough in itself, you'll also be stuck on trying to reload in a couple barrages if there's any lag at all in system, which combined effectively puts your dps somewhere around shit."
"i'll take a this."
"wtb boost"
"more alpha and a bigger clip size would be nice, i can't offer any idea's to actually balance it but it does really need to be looked at."
"as someone has said, the problem lies with all arties. oh, and as we're on it, could we please have a third range of artillery guns to bring it in line with the other races range of guns available?as a note: artillery needs revising as you need so many modules to compensate for the lack of range/tracking and locking range you completely fail to fit any kind of tank/buffer, as all other bss can do while still outranging and out-dps-ing the minmatar bs line of ships, which is kind of sad. and, of course, you need fitting mods to fit a full rack of 1400mm arties, yet it doesn't include the ability to fill up the remaining 2 highslots of a tempest."
"very much supported.\"alpha\" trix"
"i only really want 2 changes at the moment.- give us back our alpha strike - minmatar don't really have anything special here anymore.- increase the tracking to be similar to, say, the slowest tracking equivilant compeditors guns.i do have a suggestion of how alpha strike could be improved, i got this after reading someone elses suggestion of burst fire:- when an arty is activated for the first time it fires 2 shots (2.0x the current alpha), it then fires as per usual...this may be over powered, so penalties such as waiting longer for normal fire to resume, or having each of the first 2 shots only do 75% of their normal damage so they have 1.5x the alpha."

"op definitely supported. the tempest is currently the worst fleet sniper due to 1400's and was hit the hardest by scripting. you cannot have any kind of a hp buffer without dropping your optimal with tremor under 140. add in the 75% tracking penalty of tremor and you can't effectively hit a cruiser hull at that range if it's moving."
"gief boost plz"
"so you want the same tracking as other guns, or better, but you also want to keep a dps edge. that seems very fair to people using rails/lasers. because it would be so fair for single minmatar battleships to be able to double-alpha for >10,000. what an idiotic idea. i'm saying no until you give hybrids and lasers overpowered activated abilities of their own."
"if by \"dps edge\" you mean \"lowest dps of all long range turrets\" then yes, it is fair.yeah, it's not like extreme alpha is supposed to be characteristic of arty or anything. and it's not like hp has been boosted to the point where the effectiveness of arty's alpha strike would need to be reexamined."
"minmatar battleships are laughable at the moment. any sort of buff to either large projectile guns or the ships themselves would help."
"it hasn't been boosted to that point. >6k alpha is fine for now, and >10k would be idiotic and overpowered in fleet battles. boost overall dps a little if you must, and clip size, fine, but you can't have both superior dps and tracking. i know your little mind struggles with this concept, but there is such a thing as considering how buffs will affect other races."

"i support the unban of this guy. he helped in improvment of the qos of this game in a sence. truth was revealed. in real life the law punishes who reveals personal data unless this serves the common good. i think in the case of ********** we have the perfect example of the above."
"it's a request to review, not to unban; ++1"
"ok...what the hell? i hope that ********** is never allowed to play this game again. as for what i have read i get the impression that all he was doing is griefing players, whether they are gm's or not it doesn't matter.i say f*** him and f*** this thread!not supported! if you are so against ccp and this game don't play it and go else where, where the dev's and gm's are angels and hand you the game on the plate.oh and the csm does not have any right or should have the powers to get ban's lifted and if they ever do i will campaign for the csm to be removed, because they are players with their own interests, they are not impartial!"
"so outing gm's who do nothing wrong and spoiling the game for them because he wants to be unbanned is for the common good how? i agree that if someone is doing something wrong they should be brought to the attention of the law. however, the player base is not the law they are the rabble, the great unclean, the law is ccp. comparison to real life (because you did): you suspect that someone is a kiddie fiddler but don't have absolute proof, would you go to the police or would you go to the sun newspaper (any form of media outlet) with a picture of the bloke and say that he is a naughty man and that he should be strung up?if the person is and you go to the police then he gets arrested and tried by the law, however if go to the newspaper first you could damage the the case and it could mean that he gets off because of a technicality.if the person isn't and you go to the police, the matter gets investigated and the charges dropped thats all good, however if you go to the newspaper with this then and you ruin this guys life because after investigation it turns out he has done nothing wrong. what have you done? you have ruined an innocent mans life (that sort of stuff never comes off) and also screwed yourself over because he can now sue you for damages.oh and serving the 'common good' can only be seen in hindsight. as what one person thinks is serving the 'common good' may not actually be serving the 'common good' but actually just serving their own good.and finally its ccp's game and we pay to play it, there are no laws/rules to say that they have to let anyone play it because we say so."

"can ccp point us to some thread where the official reason this guy was banned is explained? not generic explanations like \"he violated the eula\" but in specific what was the exact rule of eula he violated?"
"hahaha thats funny man ^ ^, you wont find that on these forums, he posted a copy of the banning on the sight if i remember right"
"i believe the exact reasoning comes down to ccp banned kug for creating additional work load for ccp employees. what this is referring to is the manner in which he revealed the t20 information and the threadnought and disabling of the forums that followed this information being public."
"no, you still don't get it. the exact same item (in terms of market tab, attributes and so on, even if it's a separate item for reprocessing purposes) but obtained from different blueprints needing other types/amounts of materials.so, right now you have only a \"caldari shuttle blueprint - mark i\" which under perfect conditions needs 2500 tritanium to build one caldari shuttle that reprocesses into 2500 tritanium. in the future, you could have a \"caldari shuttle blueprint - mark ii\" which under perfect conditions needs, say, 500 tritanium plus 625 pyerite to build one caldari shuttle (for all intents and purposes not related to reprocessing identical to the caldari shuttle from the mark i blueprint) that would reprocess either into the same 500 trit + 625 pye (in case you keep separate item ids but somehow merge them in the market tab) or into the original 2500 tritanium. personally, i prefer this second option, no separate ids, and reprocessing into \"mark i\" version, if at all.the base value of trit is 2 isk per unit, pyerite 8, so the base price of a shuttle (via \"mark i\" blueprint) is 5000 isk. the alternative \"mark ii\" blueprint needs a base value of 6000 isk in minerals, but is still only worth the same 5000 isk for insurance purposes, and, in case no separate ids are used at all, refines into same 5000 isk of base value of materials, even if the base value of minerals you used in its construction was 20% higher.and this is just the simplest example, using only one single alternative build method.depending on ship race, size, module type or anything else, the manufacturing alternatives could follow some clear rules of replacement (how much percentage of what mineral value converted in what other mineral value and so on)... as long as some form of replacement is available for most items, and covers (overall) all possible mineral-to-mineral replacements.p.s. it doesn't even have to be this way for ships, especially since you have the reprocessing issues that can lead to pretty nasty side-effects. this part of the proposal works a lot better with non-refineables (i.e. t2 components)."
"no i do actually understand that version of your reasoning, but its a waste of database as i said, it just makes miners make slightly different choices, or mission runers do differnt stuff with thier drops, or market players hedge different commodities. look face reality, insurance will be nerfed long before ccp would entertain your perceived problem and its cure, why? well its a overall reduction in server load whilst your idea increaces server load as it requires lots of code to implement and space to store etc. an insurance nerf also would render all you say invalid as the alledged base price would cease to exist like its cap which went when npc reprocessable goods began dissappearing. the free market would take over and the real value of minerals would be shown and maybe the roid belts and drop ratios/items will be tweaked by dr e and ccp to restore time / risk / reward balance in all 3 sec lvl's to whats apporiate.basically in its crudest terms all your saying is lets make stuff with what ever (and slow the server down) while making a new sink for minerals to fall into when reprocessing a percentage of stuff."
"this is the best and probally only peice of inspiration i've seen in 12 pages.meta lvl t2 bpc chances when inventing could be a way to acheive alternative composition/attribute blueprints and thereby broarden the material requirements of both roid and moon derived materials and minerals. it could be tied into faction warfare rewards,lvl 5 r&d agent datacores, lots of things over and above basic skill books which would broadern players opportunities for fun and profit. it also is something that newer players can strive for and older players can expliot until there caught up to, reduces t2 prices and creates premium meta lvl items that tech 2 bpo holders have no advantage over. all addition server load with this idea actually adds new content too at every stage, its not the same stuff but diffferent but not different stuff idea of the op."
"/signed"
"slow a database down a by significant amount by adding a few more rows to a table? (he didn't say he wanted to duplicate every bpo in existance, just t2 components)you might as well argue that ccp should not accept new players since they will slow the servers down...true to your name, as alwaysalso, you don't actually have to duplicate db entries, just have a universally applicable procedure like \"turn 50% of trit requirements into pyerite for this particular manufacture job\""
"waste of database space ? as in, out of the multiple tb of data the game has, adding a couple of hundred (or even thousands, for that matter) static data types of blueprints/reactions, that would actually make a diffeence ? don' make me laugh.and that would be a bad thing because ? yeah. right. you don't have an explanation to that.insurance has nothing to do with those ratios. insurance only has something to do with absolute price levels. even if you completely remove insurance, things won't get better, they'd only get worse, as in, lowends will become increasingly more profitable, and highends decreasingly less profitable.you have zero idea of what you're talking about. lots of code to implement ? how about next to zero code to implement ? and how about negligible space to store ? no, the base price would become zero, that's what would happen. the only remaining things will be just how low everybody is willing to go in regards of isk/hour mining or missioning compared to how high they're willing to go for ships. all t1 item prices will crash quite nasty, but not enough to stop it from rendering pvp a lot less attractive.the \"free market\" will do next to squat. you know what will happen ? veldspar will become the most valuable ore to mine in terms of isk/hour, even in deep 0.0, as prices of minerals obtainable from drone loot drops and mission-running loot reprocessing (especially zydrine and megacyte) take a huge drop, alongside pyerite (heavily featured in mission loot too), with tritanium being the most overrated minerall overall.that is the \"real\" value of minerals, in terms of \"where is it cheapest to get from\".____there needs to be some form, any form of \"negative feedback\" for each mineral/material pair, so that as soon as one gets too much more (or less) valuable than the intended ratios, there is some kind of backward pressure to restore the initial ratio.this does not eliminate absolute price fluctuations, it doesn't eliminate relative price fluctuations either, it just makes it increasingly difficult for prices to get past a certain relative level, no matter what other conditions we might have in the game world."
"re read what the op said plz, they bought up shuttles which don't happen to be t2 do they, a bpo called shuttle ii is an additional line?, they cost more and are also worth less (reprocess) and that undermines thier utility.ok so slow the server down may be so slight you may not notice, it it all adds up eventually. all that is added is a new bpo, that generates additional buy and sell orders for them, it also reduces availability of science and industry lines as more competition for them. it doesn't matter how much of whatever is comsumed making the good database wise does it as they already exist in the game and already have their buy/sell order lines etc. adding a duplicate item therefore adds a greater database load for no real phyical end benifit, the item could have been made at a different price using existing methods, thats the mechanic of the game and the real world the substitution is a duplication as no addition attributes are held by the goods.you may notice that i elaborate the t2 bpc modification above which is a good idea, they could use difering amounts of existing materials without which actually gives a far great effect to the game for the same amount of effort, it deals with over supplied minerals and reactions to a degree for inputs and it undermines tech 2 bpo holders advantage by offering a meta lvl version of a tech 2 item as they have to use the bpc route to get them. far more of a win win don't you agree.yes its small scale, effects only high end players, but the risk reward ratios will always be broken because its a game and people sell at well below cost at times as they don't put a value on thier time or datacores etc, thats because its a game, understand its for fun not making shed loads of isk's. anyone however can take advatage and turn a profit by becoming a factor for such goods, if you can cover your losses, buy what you want when you want, having 500 trillion isk doesn't add to the fun of the game, it just makes wannabe captialst slave owners get an erection."
"a most important issue."
"akita t>..cost benifit!they (new bpo's and associated items as outlined above) are calls for no purpose, the good already exist, additional load for no real benifit apart from market regulation, but yes its very slight, jita will be 1 nano sec later, but it is an effect none the less. they are less attractive to the market as imput cost is higher and reprocessing value is lower % than existing.did i say changing ppl's behaviour is bad, nope i did not, i said it would change i gave no comment on what type of change it would be or the effects on the individuals, you have assumed something from nothing, the implication is yours alone from my nuetural observation.ratios are set by market availabity and customer demand across the board, yes removal of insurance will make the free market take over, you have stated that you like free markets not communist co-ops that are regulated, but you now admit that you don't want to have a free market as prices will change in ways that may cause chaos in game, but whats a little choas in a sandbox?its cost benifit / impact on game, storage costs money, cpu cycles costs money, bandwidth costs money, writing code costs money, testing that code costs money, deploying it costs money, if it can be done better and cheaper they will, they want the greatest effect for the lowest price, they run a business too you know.prices will never be zero unless everyone stops being greedy, stops blowing other ppl up etc, you fail with that straw man, its a totally bogus argument, a better one would have been a market crash and re adjustment to eve perceived values which would hurt lots of people while enriching others at thier expense, but having it otherwise is communism isn't it.lol you don't understand a free market and why you have never lived in one, its a nasty, nasty place, the amarr mixed with the caldari stories are loose demonstrations of what a free market will acheive (mega corps and thier elites and slaves with a hint of religon to make it palatable and soothe the soul).veldspar may be best isk/hr but only until miners exploit it and drive the price down, as i said the risk reward time ratio can be tweaked by roid and loot manipulation, 15% less chance of npc loot, would have a greater effect than what you propose."
"i agree."
"definately need adjustment to minerals to make ores have correct risk/reward. nocx needs a boost, trit needs a downgrade in price. i would recommend adjusting drone drops by replacing nocx with trit in some of the drone alloys.as to moon metals, i think the exploration system could bring additional supply.i would also love to see moon metal hauler spawns. if they carry mins around, why not moon metals."
"supportedthe current moon materials market is getting increasingly like the t2 bpo monopolise of old. those with the moons have the resources to do as they please with the market but the rest of the market suffers; it would be ok if other lower end moons where less profitable, but still profitable, but the extreem value of a few moons is badly unbalancing industry atmi'm not sure what the solution is persoanly, but i would like to maybe see the demand for rare resources fall and lower end ones increase, like the way you need a great deal of tirtanium to build a battleship, so that those with low end moons or doing processing of moon materials have the ability to turn some sort of profit, whilst those who worked for the high ends still enjoy a high value for those assets-this is my personal view and is not indicative of any views heled by my alliance or corperation-"
"what's most amusing by this turn of events is that akita predicted the bottle neck would be moved to moon minerals instead of where it was (read bpos) before the advent of invention.and i'd have to go looking... but i'm pretty sure akita also predicted which t2 moon mins would be the bread winners.this is what brainless bimbo is missing. the only true influence anyone has in totality over the market is ccp. we players think we have a free market... but we still play within the guided and fenced areas that ccp sets."
"made that prediction so long ago i have trouble finding the post myself of course, back then, i had no idea just how skewed the demand:supply ratios for moon materials were, so i considered it a desirable change. it would still be ok, if the ratios of demand in products would be (inversely) proportional to scarcity of material, not the current situation.a possibility (actually, make that \"most likely\") would be that i made that prediction in the now-deleted forum subsection that handled \"kali pre-release issues\" (the codename for \"revelations\"), so you'd only be able to find those posts on eve-search.edit: hmm, not there either. just checked."
"the \"problem\" with ores in the op is not actually a problem - price fluctuations are not a bad thing. ore prices are relatively reasonable now. the highsec ores are worth about 60-90 isk per m3, lowesc are 60-100, and 0.0 are 130-450. lowsec needs a boost(i've suggested putting gneiss, dark ochre, and spodumain in scannable belts, to up the lowsec peak to about 220), but the 5:1 ratio between bistot and veldspar is just fine. they have value in proportion to their rarity and difficulty of access, and ores with similar availability are pushed to similar prices for obvious reasons. i don't think loot refinement has yet managed to meet the demand for any mineral(though i don't have data to back that up), so there shouldn't be any bottoming-out going on because of it. also, i'll specifically say no to alternate blueprints - i don't want to deal with the astoundingly large headaches that would cause. as for moons, i'm open to moon concentration being expanded upon, because the current system is both too unbalanced and too hard-limited for my liking. i don't know exactly what the right fix is, but there does seem to be a problem.edit: one thing i forgot to mention. calling this a \"critical\" issue is a filthy lie."
"akita t has been around a lot longer than i, her prediction of a new bottleneck with moon materials would replace the t2 bpo monolopy isk printing press was known to ccp before they even anounced kali, if they didn't the game designer wasn't doing his job. remember we don't know the long story do we, ccp dev's are reading this thread laughing at our squabling, have you noticed that they are recovering the story line regarding the amarr succession that went astray (lolz), so they got a long term plan albeit sketcky and flexiable, but they aren't flying by the seat of thier pants. there are so many ways that the moon material bottleneck inducing market issue can be solved, but it has to adhere to an over all concept and add a lot to the game play in a radically diferent and rewarding way for evryone for it to divert attention to the next build in bottle neck which is there to replace it. bottlenecks have to exist in the game, control of criticial items drives game play, for that not to happen makes the game carebear central, if high end moon minerals weren't a premium they would lose the value needed to drive alliance conflict. high end moon materials just got a boost, more is available in black rise, so supply has increaced in high ends, but the alliances set the price and availability of high end minerals and control the bottleneck. if ccp can see that its politically engineered why should they act, its part of the player driven content ffs."
"it was well before kali had sections dedicated to it, and at that point invention was just a glimmer in some dev's eye done on a blog or some such.in any event, tbe best solution is to create a better ratio of moon minerals for t2 components and then also include alternate prints that mirror.. say... the locales in space.for instance northern regions are heavy gas but in the end with the right prints can produce the same thing. southern regions are metal heavy, but again with the right prints can produce the same thing.in this regard, no single location has complete control and bottle neck.with regard to ores, the solution is simple and has been presented nine hundred times over. eliminate insurance, and eliminate high end minerals from loot drops."
"do you mean eliminating insurance entirely, or just its price-fixing aspect? and if it's the former, why? as for loot drops, loot drops are items, and refine as such. what you're suggesting is to remove high-end minerals from all item blueprints, and that's crazy."

"after ready this topic for the last three days. (yes i am a slow reader) i dont claim to be an expert but most of the suggestions seem complicated. my idea for the mineral debate would be to ad a new elite class of veldspar. that refined into more tritanium and only spawned in lowsec and 0.0reasoning i see is 0.0 would not need as much of the highsec mined trit and for lowsec it would be more reward vs risk to mine it in lowsec"

"i am not the most eloquent person out there so i will post this as best as possible so that everyone can form their own opinion.i believe the pilgrim needs to be looked at for balancing issues. of all the force recons it is completely outside the box. first i will do a comparison of the recons to get a feel of why the pilgrim should be looked at to be fixed to be more in line with the rest of the force recons.minmatar:the hugin, which is the combat recon, receives bonuses as such: 25% medium projectiles rof, 37.5% target painter effectiveness, 300% web range and 25% to heavy, ham and assault launcher rof. the rapier, which is the force recon, receives bonuses as such: 25% medium projectile rof, 37.5% target painter effectiveness, 300% web range and 96% - 100% reduction cloaking cpu. role bonus: 80% reduction liquid ozone use and 50% reduction in cyno field duration.caldari:the rook, which is the combat recon, receives bonuses as such: 50% reduction ecm cap use, 100% ecm optimal, 100% ecm strength, 25% heavey and light kinetic missile damage.the falcon, which is the force recon, receives bonuses as such: 50% reduction ecm cap use, 100% ecm optimal, 100% ecm strength and 96% - 100% reduction cloaking cpu. role bonus: 80% reduction liquid ozone use and 50% reduction in cyno field duration.gallente:lachesis, which is the combat recon, receives bonuses as such: 25% medium hybrid turret damage, 25% remote sensor dampener effectiveness, 100% warp disruptor range and 25% heavy missile launcher and assault missile launcher.arazu, which is the force recon, receives bonuses as such: 25% medium hybrid turret damage, 25% remote sensor dampener effectiveness, 100% warp disruptor range and 96% - 100% reduction cloaking cpu. role bonus: 80% reduction liquid ozone use and 50% reduction in cyno field duration.amarr:curse, which is the combat recon, receives bonuses as such: 25% tracking disruptor effectiveness, 50% bonus drone hit points and damage, 200% nos and neut range and 100% bonus to nos and neut ammount.pilgrim, which is the force recon, receives bonuses as such: 25% tracking disruptor effectiveness, 50% bonus drone hit points and damage, 100% bonus to nos and neut ammount and 96% - 100% reduction cloaking cpu. role bonus: 80% reduction liquid ozone use and 50% reduction in cyno field duration.the first thing you will notice is that the pilgrim is the only force recon that loses its range bonus. the range of the regular t2 medium nos and neut is 12 km. this means that to be in range to use this specialized cap weapon you have to also be in close combat range, web range and scram range, forcing the pilgrim into a niche role of the only recon that must be in close range to use all of its bonuses. before the nos nerf this was ok as it could nos a target to fuel any tank it may field. since the nos nerf, use of nos to fuel a tank is no longer a viable option. since the pilgrim must be in nos and neut range to fight, it must have some sort of tank. at this time it does not have an effective tank. the pilgrim is thus at a huge disadvantage compared to any other recon ship at large.i believe that to bring it in line with the other recon there are two viable options."
"option 1:since the pilgrim is a drone boat as well as a recon, it would seem to me that it needs to do its damage with drones since its highs would be taken up with nos and neuts so it utilizes its bonuses. i suggest removing the drone bonus but increasing the bandwidth to 125mb so that it can field heavy drones similar to the ishtar (without a dmg bonus), and replacing the drone damage bonus with a bonus for its tank since it must fight in close range to use all its bonuses. either increase its armor resists similar to a mauller at 5% per level or increase its armor amount similar to the navy issue augoror at 10% per level. this would allow the pilgrim to field a decent tank and survive long enough to use its bonuses.option 2:remove the drone damage bonus since all the other combat recons have one damage bonus removed and let the pilgrim retain the range bonus. this would allow the pilgrim to remain in line with the rest of the combat and force recons, letting it use all of the bonuses it has been given at a safe range. however, the pilgrim would no longer be able to do any damage to speak of, which may upset some people. one fix would be to go with the idea i put in option 1 and increase the drone bandwidth a bit so the pilgrim could field larger drones.i have flown the pilgrim quite a bit, and have some experience with it. i am by no means an expert with the pilgrim, but i do like the option to fly a semi-combat ship that can warp cloaked. at the moment it's only viable against noobs who don't know what they are doing and against a very select line of ships. any missile boats, passive tanks or well-skilled pilots will defeat a pilgrim pilot simply due to the pilgrim having to be in close combat range, where it can't take the damage while effectively using all of its bonuses as can other force recon.thank you for reading. please feel free to leave your comments and suggestions as i know this isn't the end all be all, and there are probably much better ideas and suggestions than what i have come up with.please don't forget if you support this thread to click that suport box when posting a reply to show your support!czy4rr on! p.s and yes i did have my girlfriend proofread this so i didn't sound like a complete idiot."
"reserved"
"well writen up post./signed"
"i agree the pilgrim needs a boost, but not via any of your suggested options. you came close to what we really need, but you never quite hit it. here it is: option 3. replace it's amount bonus with a range bonus, but keep all other aspects the same. this would bring it in line with the other force recons (except the falcon) in the way that they get range bonuses, but lose out on one of the effectiveness bonuses. this would not obsolesce the curse, as the curse would retain an extra mid slot and have a much higher neuting potential. it would, however, make the pilgrim viable in gangs or solo; as it is, it's lucky to kill a cruiser, and in gangs the curse far out-performs it."
"pilgrim certainly needs something."
"/signed.pilgrim needs some love. since the problem was first posted (by hydrogen) nearly 8 months, and roughly 30-odd pages of support, still no word from ccp.."
"ccp needs to make the pilgrim worth flying. rapier = great asset for our gang.falcon = great asset for our gang.pilgrim = do you have any other ship you can bring?"
"i agree, just looking at it's bonuses compared to the others it needs boosting."
"no need to say anything."
"ask jade, he makes a big issue out of this, telling we are the ones that made that site."
"it has more to do with judgment. jade has a long history of terrible judgment. this brothel being one of the more funny incidents. what makes it better is he/she continues to lie, denying he was involved. this was hosted on his server until a couple weeks ago."
"dear lord. i'm shocked. and not in the way you'd imagine. who gives a ****ing **** about some person's rping? and who cares if they profit from it, or make some people uncomfortable? if you don't like the content, don't go to the site. people rp all sorts of crap if given the opportunity; a ***** is probably better than a murderer (though i'm sure most rping people in this game do rp murderers). what's your point?also, how does one rationalize that someone's rp can affect the way they'd take the game? remember that he's just one guy. there are nine total members. in order to do something weird to the game (like adding a space brothel?) a majority of the council members would have to agree, ccp would have to agree, and a large proportion of the player base would have to agree. what the hell are you afraid of?"
"my bet would be on cooties"
"you did. you downloaded the files from my server - you registered a domain called jadeconstantine.web and rehosted my files there. you made that site at that url.that took some effort on the part of goonfleet. maybe we should be asking why you bothered?i said on shc it seemed like you were hosting some kind of creepy stalker tribute site since you you've used my character name to make a domain and seem to find it amazingly fascinating. and thats exactly what it is - its a celebrity stalker thing .. you must be proud seriously. that old \"la maison\" site was there for what best part of 5 years? characters listed there included miso, dbpreacher, lianhaun, charity regard, josephine and others. they were damn famous players back in year on and the idea of a chat channel that was like the bar in casablanca where different sides got to play ic politics while pouring drinks and flirting was always pretty big news. we used to recruit for events there, we arranged the elariel pleasure gardens security detail there - jf used to announce all its best wars there. i remember having virtual drinks with robeyone and halseth durn on the eve of the gnw there and thats history. i mean not sure what i'm supposed to be embarrassed about really. heh, i notice you goonfleet guys are completely up with a guy who likes to roleplay being a slave master of matari prisoners! maybe its just gf are closet goreans then? but what it really shows is just how sad goonfleet is to try to make an issue over something like this. shows you don't have a clue about eve history and you really don't know when your little campaigns of demonization are actually alienating you guys rather than your chosen target.funny"
"wow goonies... just pathetic.get back to geminate and fight us instead of wasting time with this bull****.when i started eve and was reading about the beginnings of the goon/bob war i almost rooted for the goons.after having to hear your **** so much for so long i obviously joined the gbc and proceeded to kill you.this is what your bull**** does. it alienates people who would have otherwise been sympathetic.go back to second life and make it rain dildos and get the hell out of eve.jade forever!! down with goonie *****es!!"
"with all this ducking & weaving you would have been an excellent boxer."
"why are you so bitter?"
"i definitely agree with jade, and that's why i voted for her!goonies and the other big boys only play this game to grief others with combat and ruin everyone else's fun. they completely miss the finer points of eve -- the excellent playground it is to rp our space-borne fantasies! people like me and jade are lucky to have a game and an rp background that allows us to transcend the gender that a capricious god gave us at birth, to become the seductive, witty, politically-savvy space-temptresses that we really are on the inside!personally i can't wait until ambulation, when i'll have not just a pretty portrait to go with my flirty, witty chat, but an entire (and entirely lovely!) body! hopefully with customizable clothes (or not! ;-) ) and plenty of cute emotes. i plan to set myself up in a salon orbiting the galente homeworld and sip space-wine while being courted by my noble suiters. what a joy it will be to play the game the way *i* want to play it, and not bother with all the ugly combat and rude griefers.and don't think i'm alone -- there is a reason that jade got the most votes out of all the candidates, after all! i think that \"ladies\" like myself are a silent majority in eve, and we definitely deserve to have our views represented on the council. we need a voice and a strong hand that will shape this game to meet its greatest potential for the kind of play that so many of us enjoy (need!) so much.so in conclusion, keep up the good work jade! shine on you crazy diamond!"
"hi darius!"
"i don't get it, there's proof but he's still saying it's false."
"i don't use alts stupid. you obviously know nothing about my eve history!"
"i'll give a free crow interceptor to the first person in this thread that posts why i think its your alt with relevant forum quotes"
"step it up to a free cyber and i'll take you up on it."
"v0v think all you want. it's your prerogative. i find it mildly amusing that you'd think for a second that i'd feel the need to hide behind an alt to mock you."
"i am against the purpose of this thread. i don't see what is the problem with something that after all promotes rp. rp which is a rarity anyway. i think some people are getting too puritans as of late. i don't see anything wrong of a rping brothel in eve. in fact such actions add some spice to the game. if you don't like it you may very well not partecipate. if you really need a holy purpose go after the macro farmers and let the very few rpers be!"
"it wasn't actually a brothel you know ... but the thoughts appreciated nonetheless."
"posting to become famous!i fully support rp brothels in all honesty, i don't think it matters what jade or any csm has done in eve to this point, but what they will do as a csm."
"y'all had better not push jade, it looks like he's getting pretty closetothaedge"
"at this rate, he'll hit super saiyan before iceland."
"he's gathering the spirits of every whiny, pedantic, pansexual nerd into himselfhe is forming a whining-bomb!"
"jade is awesome, glad i voted for him and would do it again."
"asmuch as i think jade should step down. i honestly dont think what he does in his rp matters. and if your so shocked by a shim being a rp sm bordello or whatever. you really need to open your eyes more. and if you that uncomfortable with it. ya better get out of mmo. not suported as its to lame. however i still support removal of jane from the chair for past behavior in meeting that do affect the outcome of the csm and my representation to ccp."
"i agree."
"oh noes, cybering in an online game, what is the internet coming to!....i mean, really, it's ok to consistently and happily pod other pretend human beings whilst feeling good about yourself, but not ok to engage in this ? - everyone calls this a sandbox...."
"whilst the csm, and jade in particular, continues with its current antics - i don't think you have to worry about ccp taking it seriously."
"this is a horrible idea and it's not surprising that it's received almost zero support outside jade's space buddies. i ask the council representatives to look at the number of posts in this thread calling the idea stupid vs the number of support votes, and accordingly vote to not escalate this to the csm platform."
"i am completely against this idea. we work years to acquire wealth and prosperity and if real life calls for an extended leave of absence during a war that results in the loss of the outpost you have lived in for years, you lose everything you have in eve. i would refuse to start over with nothing to my name. i value my time and that results in value for in game possession. the way outposts are now is fine. there are several ways to evacuate items out of captured stations and that is how it should be. losing so much would disvalue eve as a whole. it already has a huge risk vs reward theme and does not need to be all risk and no reward."
"voting no."
"destructible outposts in and of itself is not a bad idea, but your proposed implementation is nothing short of garbage. not supported."
"its already been escalated by a 7-2 vote of the csm."
"good to see."
"jita 4-4 is down i repeat jita 4-4 is down. if we can get in empire to i see no reason not to. i mean i would sack 6 freighters to suicide the station."
"nothing says trolling like making people quit eve due to losing all their assets.. while i believe this is one of the dumbest ideas presented by someone who knows nothing about 0.0, goonswarm is known for its griefing... still going to say this is a horrible idea though, the last thing we need is to scare off more newcomers to 0.0. why jade has such a strong opinion of this when his alliance will never come out to 0.0 is beyond me, maybe he's jealous of all that moon mining."
"this idea makes me laugh, but only because of how absurd it truly is.then again, the idea of a corp gathering enough firepower to wipe 0.0 clean of outposts is appealing.still voting no."
"i'm laughing at how this was ever thought to be a good idea."
"terrible idea, jade doesn't even do 0.0 stuff.if you are going to make suggestions about how 0.0 warfare should work you should probably have some experience in it."
"heh, hardly. i think sf has access to more isk than you'll ever see little goonie. but seriously. behind your trolling is a real point. at the moment 0.0 is a one dimensional setting. only way you can upset a territorial power is by becoming a territorial power. only way you hurt an outpost owner is by becoming one. and thats bad for the game - its a lack of variety in the end-game. still, csm voted 7-2 to escalate and we get to ask ccp what they think. thats what i promised to aim for in my election campaign and i'm very happy that eve will get to hear the answer to the question in the op. maybe they'll say \"no bad idea\" and agree with you. if so at least we tried. can't say fairer than that. asking the question was a decent idea and while a couple of dozen frenzied anti posters and their alts here disagree a couple of thousand actual voters agreed during the election and 7/9 csm reps confirm the validity of the issue. shows the process works."
"this will be brilliant. i cant wait to grief more pubbies out of this game after they have lost everything they own.jade you are the best csm dictator to date."
"still can't get that bitter taste at failing at 0.0 out of your mouth jade?"
"kill everyone"
"not entirely sure what you mean there. 0.0 for me means \"fat territorialist pigs to shoot\" - thats why our alliance plays the game. its hardly failing when every time we come out we shoot some more regressive dogs is it? i think you're taking this game too seriously mr goon."
"it makes a good point. goons can have fun our way, and it can have fun its way."
"/that being the main reason you do not want to mess with t2 bpo's you only have what around 86?"
"yeah, there's just a slight logical disconnect there:\"outposts are unfair because they hinder the ability of new players to break into 0.0\"\"nerfing t2 bpos is unfair because people have worked hard for them and taking that away to help out newbies with invention is a bad idea\"so jade, you want to help non-power bloc players into 0.0 (not being part of a territorial power yourself) but you're happy with the advantages of the t2 bpo holders (being part of an economic power yourself).seems awfully selfish to me."
"horrible idea. how does making it harder for empire players to move out to 0.0 serve the eve community? i hope that all members of the csm give jade a napalm enema for proposing this moronic idea. further more i'd suggest that matters regarding 0.0 come from players who have actual 0.0 experience."
"newer, smaller alliances trying to get a foothold will be in trouble at one point anyway if they don't align with one of the current power blocks. i think this is an excellent idea."
"hear, hear."
"people were voting for csm representatives not csm chair."
"how would it invalidate the election? op is asking for a vote to remove him from the chair. and we the constituants agree or disagree. not asking for a removal from the csm. it boils down to this. he muted and in doing so denied a csm to vote. intentional or stupidity of how the channel moderation worked he still did it.the csm in question had asked jade not to editorialize (sp) and was told they were being disruptive. sort of a how dare you deny my autority to do as i plse. when a csm asked why they were being warned rather then explain how it was a disruption. and muted when the call from the floor was made to explain the disruption. again the how dare you question my authority. had he comein said yes i was wrong and i shall conduct myself in a more professional manner and applogized to the csm. this would have blown over. alas he didnt and has let this blow way way beyond repair. on top of all that he insults his constituancy even more by calling them nonfactors as they are all goons and goonswarm. which many infact are not. myself included."
"jade: even if everyone agreed with you 100% on the issues, you'd still be a bad chair because you're trying to give the chair too much power. imagine someone really horrible becomes your successor. a democratic council of equals would thwart their attempted reign of terror. this borderline dictatorship you're setting up, where the chair chooses who can speak & what issues may be raised, is only going to enable it. your continued power grabs show either that you completely lack foresight or that you're purposely trying to harm the csm's long term viability. whichever it is, you shouldn't be chair.also i'm surprised so many goons have signed this thread, given that with their numbers they're the most likely to be able to win the chair in the next elections & benefit from all of the extraordinary powers jade's trying to give the position. are you guys just too add to wait 6 months or are you all secretly gigantic fans of democracy & supporters of the little guy?"
"in a normal parliamentary body, the chair is generally a non-voting position. the csm was set up with more of a chair-lite where the chairperson's sole additional responsibility over a normal representative is to draw up the agenda for meetings, but still retains voting rights. jade's blatant disregard for this original intention is reason enough to request removal.supported."
"simple answer is no. i've said a couple of times in the course of this thread. only way this could conceivably happen is: 1. a csm rep decides to support and advocate this issue after its been in discussion for 7 days. 2. csm rep puts it on the agenda for a meeting. 3. during the meeting it needs a 5/9 (4/7) votes to pass and become an issue for the formal conference between csm/ccp.4. supporting csm would write it up as a submission document and we'd discuss the measure with the ccp council. 5. what happens then nobody really knows because we have no idea if ccp are happy to have the choice of the electorate overturned by a motion supported by a tiny fraction of the votes cast in the main election.but its all a little academic since this thread hasn't received the 5% of the electorate vote required to force it onto the csm meeting agenda, and it hasn't been supported and advocated by a csm rep. at the moment its like a protest thing from angry goons really thats becoming a bit pointless because literally everyone else has already gotten over it and moved on through a very productive meeting in mid-week and expectation of another one on sunday."
"absolutely."
"i suspect we'll end up deciding to go for a rotating chair or even ask ccp to supply us with a ccp-provided non voting chair to do the admin to be honest. there is no advantage to having an empowered chair in any way. this whole argument was about the definition of \"moderation\" and got compounded by a desire to finish completing issues in a time crunch. remove the time pressure and moderation stops being an issue because if meetings fail to get *absolutely everything* done - it won't matter so much. anyway contrary to the fears of the goons on this thread i'm really pretty relaxed about the role of chair in this csm progress. i'm happy to see it rotating, see moderation and admin duties shared, or whatever else can be agreed on. single best idea anyone has come up with in the last week was saphrine who suggested putting the admin stuff at the end of the agenda not the begin. that solves so many problems its silly we didn't think of it in the first place!"
"+1. it needs to be replaced."
"/signed."
"you suck, get a life,l gtfoim for jade btw. goons suck."
"jade, just out of curiosity, whatever happened to you stepping down from chair and letting the csm vote someone in, like you said you would do at the very start?and don't try to feign ignorance when you \"accidentally\" miss this post like you are bound to do"
"sorry to have to say this (that was a flat lie), but you're either dead wrong, or deploying a smoke screen. quoting:\"by default, the representative with the highest vote tally is awarded with theresponsibilities of chairman for the csm.\"notice the \"default\". that means that the representative with the most votes is chairman if, and only if, the chairman isn't selected in a different way. that's what it says. not more, and not less. practically, that means that a motion of no confidence against you is useless, as you'd still be chairman. a vote of confidence for another member does make sense, though. in fact, i'm wondering why it didn't already happen, considering all that mud throwing around here.thank you all for informing yourselves before posting. i'm proud of you. don't interpret things into the space between the lines, you'll miss your freedom."
"the reason it didn't happen the same reason darius and bane are running the goonswarm rather than being plebs inside goonswarm. they are smart enough to see that wasting the csm's time with stupid little power plays will reflect badly on them.at the end of the day our reputations as csm reps depend on getting the job done and promoting issues to the attention of ccp."
"says the idiot who started all the ******ed power play crap just get out."
"bane is a pleb. fyi"
"i am deeply moved by your expression of respect for your fellow council members and your ability to distract from topics. i can't see how the election of a chairman could possibly distract the council more than this very debate."
"you sound a little bit stressed. maybe have a cup of tea and play some internet spaceships rather than student politics? seriously its not the end of the world that you don't get your way on this. pace yourself, maybe i'll get indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for internet posting or perhaps you could open a class action suit and try to have me deported to texas or something?"
"this isn't a debate its a threadnaught. (and a little light entertainment)"
"actually this thread isn't a threadnaught. it's a thread with the sole purpose of removing someone so obviously unsuitable from their position. it's what the assembly hall was designed for, showing support for issues that concern the players of this game."
"well technically its designed for showing support for issues that concern all players of the game. whereas this is a petty little vendetta that only concerns bitter little fruits and their alts and cheerleaders. so far this thread has less support than goum got in the election. its not exactly a sterling triumphant beginning for your crusade and its actually alienated more people than its convinced."
"if you pulled your thumb our of your arse for a few seconds, you would realise that there are more than a few non goons telling you that you are a raging idiot and to get out.edit: word count."
"yep, and all his replies in this thread are pretty childish, he's made it clear he should be off csm, as soon as possible."
"you're assuming that bane and darius have rallied goonswarm to tell you that you're wrong? you have no idea how we work. besides, have you seen ra or tcf or any of our major allies appear in these threads? hell, i've hardly seen bob in here. they don't seem to care, and it's no business of ours to pressure anyone else into voting. we like to call it \"democracy\", but that word has a different meaning when you use it.guess what? this includes goons. stop acting like it doesn't."
"if you prefer to call it such, i'll go with you:i can't see how the election of a chairman could possibly distract the council more than this very threadnaught.in what way did i change the meaning? i think you've proven my point."
"distract who? i've done all my template writing up for the weekend - meeting agenda set, documents submitted to iceland etc etc. this thread is just another goon threadnaught - why should anybody care?"
"actually the chair rejected my motion then changed its tune and started behaving more like a council member and less like a dictator. you keep using terms like \"power plays\" and \"political points\". i have nothing to gain from either."
"indeed, why do you? i guess the rest cares about why you care."
"if you want the motion darius i told you all you had to do was support this thread and add it to the agenda as an issue. its pretty simple."
"i bolded the important part for you."
"bolded and underlined the important bits for you darius.don't try and claim you were prevented from raising this if you had wanted to. and do cut the \"it\" stuff out. it makes you look like a petulant child."
"ok, i gave you the out and tried to act civilized about the matter. the fact is that you refused any motion that limited what you stated was your authority. you were then given a set of suggestions from ccp (you've already stated this in various threads. another issue i was not trying to bring up)(after ignoring the very same suggestions from your fellow council members)and have followed them. provided you're not being a **** i have no problem with you sitting as chair. had you not changed your tone and changed your course from authoritarian to team member i would indeed be supporting this thread, which would be fairly irrelevant for the most part as all that this issue accomplishes is the creation of a conversation in iceland. is that clear enough for you now or shall i go on?of course i've already said this in various places, but you have a love for making me repeat myself.:edit: \"it\" was referring to \"the chair\" as an object not a person. calm down. you look like someone trying to play the martyr."
"incorrect. i told you needed to compose an issue thread or support an existing issue thread to raise the point and it would be voted on as a discussion topic alongside all the rest. thats what i had to do with the \"electable chair\" issue. thats what you would need to do with your issue.i really don't understand why you are still spoiling for a fight on this darius. we have come to a decent conclusion already as far as i understood. we had a very good meeting in the week and everyone has worked hard to meet our deadline. i can only assume you feel obliged to play some macho goon patriarch role here and i have to tell you it doesn't impress me in the least. grow up and get on with the job we were elected to do. stop posturing and acting like an ass."
"i'd like to add in addition to that that simply because i see no need to support this particular action at this juncture that does not mean people cannot voice their opinions or concerns on the subject. everyone is entitled to their opinions and beliefs. even when they run counter to your own."
"\"you don't get everything you want. a dictatorship would be a lot easier.\"\"there ought to be limits to freedom.\"\"i want everybody to hear loud and clear that i'm going to be the president of everybody.\"\"where things have gone wrong have been where i've made the mistake of allowing a little too much democracy and allowed them to impact the constitution itself.\"one of these is from jade constantine, though i could understand how someone would attribute them all to the same person."
"who's spoiling for a fight? i was playing mgs4 and hauling minerals. you mentioned my name and i responded. you were acting out of line, vetoed a perfectly valid vote because it didn't suit you, then proceeded to deny my two motions. those motions were indeed denied by you. you did state that it should be raised as an issue and i didn't say that you did not.i really don't care to impress you. your opinion of me is entirely irrelevant to me. if you want me to not respond to you do not associate me by name in your opinion posts."
"i was just correcting your false statement darius. you claimed i blocked your motion. i simply told you how to do it properly within the agreed procedure for raising issues. i think the problem here darius is you what you're describing that i \"blocked\" or \"denied\" you when what i actually did is tell you how it could be done properly within the rules of the csm process. i know its frustrating you can't get exactly what you want when you want it but we do have some rules for the submission of issues that the rest of us have to follow.i don't care if you respond or not darius - thats up to you. but if you come and post an untrue statement i'll feel free to correct you on it."
"correction: you stated your interpretation of how to do it properly within your personal opinion on what the agreed procedure for raising issues was. the fact is that a procedure to remove the chair wasn't documented. nor was the ability for the chair to veto votes and mute dissenting opinions in the council. we can run around in circles playing games with interpretations all night. i'd moved on."
"someone with good writing skills should send a little article about the last meeting plus this thread to a few select gaming oriented sites.see how this \"petty\" thing goes on. you are a bloody disgrace."
"there's nothing incorrect about my statement. at the time we were perfectly within our rights to raise administrative issues. it just so happens that immediately after i raised one in regards to your muting fellow council members you decided unilaterally that we were not allowed to raise issues such as that any more. there was no agreement. there was a statement by you. nothing more."
"you've proven you're no better than any \"goon\" is, jade. last thursday's meeting, if the chatlog on that third-party website is to be believed, went along much smoother, thanks to lavista vista's role as chairman. although i would like to believe that you would exit gracefully, should it come to that, i see no reason to believe that you would do so without further disgracing and embarrassing both yourself and the council. when it comes down to it, that is what this thread has shown me: infighting amongst the csms for no reason other than out-of-game quarrels, which is publicly making a mockery of this democratic process."
"btw: wasn't there a meeting after the 06-08 one? where's the transcript? i don't want to miss the lulz."
"what aren't you understanding here? darius and i hate each others guts. he has no respect for my experience in this game, i have no respect for his. you should count yourself lucky we're even talking. seriously, i'm happy to interact within the parameters we've been set by ccp but if darius tries coming on with this rubbish in public i'm going to challenge him on it - every time.i wasn't elected to roll over for the goons. get used to it."
"i posted here in response to your post here mentioning me by name. it's right here in this thread. you can try and reframe it like i was simply prancing around in this thread \"coming on with this rubbish in public\" but the fact of the matter is i had moved on and was playing videogames. i already said that too though. do you even read what anyone else writes?"
"please use that in your next electoral campaign. it surely will get you elected."
"yep thats right i had stated that you were too smart to be seen wasting everyone's time with a crappy motion like this. i'm happy to take it back. obviously you aren't that smart after all. if you had \"moved on\" then why provoke this argument by claiming i blocked your motions when what i actually did was explain to you the process of how the issues had to be raised?seriously darius. you need to chill and bow out of this stupid thread. its not helping your good judgment to be forced to perform for the goon chorus."
"you fail in clarity: did you mean to write \"darius is a moron if he supports this motion\", by any chance?edit: english should be used idiomatically for all i know."
"take it back v0v i honestly don't care. you did block my motions. interpreting the validity of motions wasn't any more in your purview than vetoing votes. if you want me to not respond to you then don't editorialize what i say. i'd be happy to post the emails to allow them to speak for themselves but i fear you would take umbrage with that and the vote to do so has not yet been had. how i can \"provoke\" an argument by clarifying what you stated was my position is beyond me. i think i'm certainly capable of speaking for myself. i certainly didn't nominate you as my spokesperson.while i appreciate your concern about my judgement it's neither asked for nor necessary."
"itt jade constantine calls somebody out for wasting time, not knowing when he's dug himself into an in-escapable hole, and making stupid threads.cats and dogs are living together, brimstone is raining from the sky"
"also jade isn't most of your experience in eve composed of writing awful fan fiction while docked in high sec wishing there was somway to wall of text cva out of existence."
"i mean remember that f13 thread where you were out argued so seriously on the topic of eve by a guy half your age who has never actually played eve that you threw a temper tantrum and edited away all of your posts?not the most sterling resume"
"no interpretation of validity was done. i told you to post an issue discussion thread or support an existing one and go through the motions for raising an issue. dunno how to make this any clearer for you. i don't care if you respond or not. its your choice at the end of the day. yeah but posting those emails would involve you breaking the terms of service you agreed wouldn't they - little bit inconvenient there. maybe you might consider not provoking public arguments every single day over every single issue we've ever talked about? how about that for an idea?you didn't clarify darius you lied. you said i blocked your motions when what i actually did is told you how you should make them within the same rules we are all bound by."
"ok, let's say this again...up until my motion to limit the scope of your moderation to prevent you from disenfranchising elected representatives at whim, like you did last sunday, we had discussed numerous administrative items. we had even had a vote on one. immediately after the motion was presented you unilaterally decided for the rest of us that we would no longer be discussing administrative issues. i was told we could not discuss that motion because of your decision and it would have to be raised as an issue. this would have meant you could have continued your wreckless vetoing and muting until ccp made a decision in iceland. thus the problem i had. change it to not blocking a motion if that makes you feel better in jadeworld. the facts are the facts and they're right there plain as day.again with the \"provoke\" word. you were acting as my spokesperson on as issue. i posted clarifying my stance for myself. that does not make me a provocateur. you do not speak for me in any way.being coy about your \"explanation\" to save face is pretty silly. the simple fact is as i stated above. prior to my raising the motion we were able to discuss administrative issues. the second one was raised that challenged you, you decided unilaterally that we were not discussing such things anymore. that's the chain of events. it's not a lie. you decided you had the authority to change the game midstream. perhaps that long and wordy explanation will sit better with you than \"blocked\". those were not \"rules we were all bound by\". just the day before we had all operated under a different premise. you decided that you didn't like that. immediately thereafter you unilaterally vetoed the vote that you didn't like from the day before, declaring it void. also not a rule we are all bound by."
"i think most of us emailed ccp asking for intervention actually. i said i wouldn't be countenancing any more \"administrative\" votes until we heard back and got some guidance. the sole significant administrative issue we'd discussed thus far was the alternates thing. if saying \"no more of this crap until we hear from ccp\" is considered by you to be a bad thing then we'll agree to differ. well like i said, lots of us had apparently asked for guidance from ccp and waiting till that guidance was given seemed like a good idea to me. spin it how you will darius, you wanted to move into the offensive with admin motions to change the balance of the council without a 7 day discussion, without submission templates and without face to face time in iceland. again i'll cite the example of the issue i brought up to impact the council dynamics \"electable chair\" and i went through the approved methods and got it openly discussed for 7 days and then voted on the csm. what made you think you didn't have to meet the same standards of approval? how about we simply tell the truth rather than listening to darius johnson trying to wriggle his way out of lying in public. i held your motions that would impact the balance of the council to the same standards that mine had met. if you call that changing the rules you really are deluded. you made an allegation that i had blocked your motions - that allegation was false. i did tell you how to raise them properly. absolutely not. again i cite the \"electable chair\" motion and its passage through the csm process. your motion of \"no confidence in the chair\" should have to follow exactly the same checks and balances and be heard in exactly the same manner. why do you think you should be the exception to the rule? i said it was void pending an inquiry to ccp. we made the inquiry, we got the information, matter was resolved. really you are flapping around like a fish on dry land here darius and making a scene for absolutely no good purpose. give it up."
"i'm not going to play the ladder quote game with you that gets tedious and i lack your flare for the boring.the fact of the matter is that your decision to not hold any more administrative votes did not occur until my motion had been raised. could that be a coincidence? certainly could. that does not change the fact that i raised the issue the same way the use of alternates issue was raised (the one you decided you could veto after a perfectly legitimate vote) and you ruled it \"out of order\" prior to there ever being any understanding that this was even a possibility. i never said you didn't allow for me to raise it as an issue here. i never lied. you can say i lied until you're blue in the face, but the facts are on the table and you stomping your feet and saying so in your typical juvenile fashion does not make it a fact.you told me no to something for which no other mechanism had been established and my choice of words was \"blocked\". what you did, did indeed have the effect of blocking the motion. you can claim nuance or want some fancier wording or explanation around it if you like but there's no lie there. the motion was not allowed to carry through along the same lines similar motions had before. that is not a lie. that is not spin. it's simply what happened. your \"telling me how to raise them properly\" did not meet the previous standard which was actually bringing the item to a vote.what made me think i didn't need to meet the 7 day standard? the fact that until it impacted you that \"standard\" didn't exist.look at jade trying to wiggle his way out of his circular argument flop flop flop flopdid i do that right? i can sling names with you all night long. call you a liar. say what you're saying is stupid. i can selectively ignore what is inconvenient to me. i didn't see a need to do that at this juncture. but i'm the juvenile. i'm the one spinning. somehow jade is always right and without fault. whether you realize it or not you're fairly transparent and one of a very few people who buys your own bull****."
"please, don't say such things. you could destroy his self-esteem. it's more fun with him not realising."
"i'll leave you to your alliance of yes-men darius. when you get to the point of simply casting insults its fairly clear you don't have an answer. was a pointless argument as they always are with you."
"quoting the first insult in this discussion:quoting the \"non-insulting\" inflammatory dance that followed:if answering repeatedly the same arguments you make is not having an answer then i guess nobody has one. it's you jade. you have the only answers and everyone else is wrong. why did i even bother having an opinion when i could have just asked you what it should be? if you don't want people to insult you don't throw the first stone. don't pretend to speak for me. don't reinterpret and editorialize my words and i won't have to respond. if i did that to you i'd expect a response. i wouldn't feign shock when it occurred."
"that's not correct. very few issues will concern all players of the game. something ridiculous like 70% of eve players never leave empire space, none of them will care about your ******ed destroying outposts idea. and yet you raised it anyway (and put it on the agenda despite the almost overwhelming negative reception). so there we go, you're wrong. it's for raising issues that concern a portion of the eve population. removing you as csm concerns a large portion of the population, you can tell this because of the almost 140 support posts in this thread. this compares very well with other issue threads in this forum (especially considering this thread is quite new compared to most). ever since this issue broke you've been trying to claim that it's a vendetta of only a few people. this is clearly incorrect. the people asking for resignation come from a wide cross section of eve's population. while you may claim that there is a large portion of goonswarm's population is here and taking part in the csm process. however, that's mostly because unlike almost all of the eve population we actually care about the csm process. 89% of eve's active players didn't even bother to vote. on the other hand a good portion of goonswarm's population is aware of this forum and for the most part have similar viewpoints on issues (we aren't a homogeneous group, though, people disagree about things constantly). no matter how many people call for your resignation you'll claim that they are a vocal minority. shame it's quite clear to all involved that that's far from true. it'll become very clear if you run in the next csm election."
"that's not precisely what i told you to post pleb. 30 demerits."
"i have some sympathy for jade in the muting issue and as chairman he certainly does have the right to do that when necessary, but the dictatorial powers he is trying to give himself are as astonishing as they are corrupt.the chair has no right to veto a vote. the chair has no right to set the agenda of a meeting and the chair most certainly has to refuse a vote of no confidence.the role of the chairman is to moderate and facilitate the meeting. he can have a deciding vote if the ballot is a dead heat but to give himself the power to veto a vote defeats the whole point of having the committee in the first place. also, every member has the right to abstain from a vote and the chair has no right to criticize, let alone change result of the vote because of it.the chairman does not set the agenda - the members of the committee do. at the end of the meeting each member should be given the opportunity to add an item to the agenda of the next meeting and the chairman has no right to refuse.as for the chairman refusing to allow a vote of no confidence in himself, well, do i really need to explain why that is utterly ridiculous?speaking of jade giving himself powers he has no right to possess, he also seems to have set himself up as dictator for life according to his explanation as to why he cannot be replaced. that explanation, unless i'm very much mistaken, applies to members of the committee, not the the role of chairman itself, which incidentally, he usurped in the first place. so yeah - i regretfully support this motion, which jade has no right to refuse. according to tradition a vote of no confidence must be attended to at the earliest opportunity under the provisions of an \"extraordinary general meeting\" which again, jade has absolutely no right to refuse. if you want him out of the chair, call an egm and vote him out. it's as simple as that.edit: committee members may also be interested to know that the chairman isn't supposed to vote at all, unless the committee is deadlocked, in which case he casts the deciding vote. if jade has been voting on issues that were not deadlocked then that too is an abuse of power."
"quite an amusing read... should lock you guys up in a room, give you all baseball bats and let you duke it out that way seeing as this seems to be doing absolutely nothing...meet on common ground and re-work it. set ground rules. get things done properly instead of wasting everyones time."
"okay, i'm going to be short and simple here.jade:1) continues to ignore many people with valid points.2) uses the name of the game's largest alliance as an insult and implies they're all stupid children, in public.3) continues to smokescreen issues instead of dealing with them.4) is letting the power he is trying to give himself go to his head.5) is bickering with darius like a child.6) has become a synonym for 'annoying, arrogant *******.'7) is now being told to gtfo in one of the most epic threads on assembly hall.jade, give up and leave while you still have some tiny shred of dignity."
"quite obvious this isn't going to work well otherwise"
"because only when it became clear that you would lose such a vote did you declare unilaterally that all such votes were verboten. the council had been running administrative procedural votes for three meetings in the same manner before the call to remove was placed. you had brought administrative procedural votes to these meetings with no objections.you're lying. you are twisting the truth so that you can say things that might be maybe possibly true in order to convey other meanings. just like when a goon re-hosted your maison site. you said \"i have nothing to do with the hosting of that page\" which, despite you creating the page, hosting it on your own domain for a long time, having posted in other boards in confirmation of you owning the site, could possibly construed to be true because that particular copy you did not put online. you said this to disassociate yourself from the content.its the same thing here. it is technically true that you did not \"block\" the motion, but only because there is no technical procedure called \"blocking\" that you could have taken advantage of.you did stop the motion from going to a vote.you did previously allow motions of similar nature from going to a voteyou had previously brought similar motions to a voteyou had never objected before to any procedural motion before such a pointso what changed? the motion was unfavorable to you and was likely to pass. just like when you editorialized hardin's motion (after without right or justification barring him from a meeting) to formalize the process by which alternatives entered and left the status of equal voting members.ed:when reasonable people get together they can make decisions about themselves and only themselves without interruption unless it breaks the founding documents.the council has the power and authority to make changes to the way it operates in meetings [b]if only for the reason that because its you agreeing between yourselves to take an action, the csm document presents a way for you to step down and the only thing preventing it from happening is you blocking the motion that would formalize them asking for you to do so and abide by the will of the council i like how you define \"all players of the game\" as \"players who agree with me\""
"jade continues to show his unprofessionalism and is letting down all his voters imho.you should step down, let the vice take your place and shut the heck up.and if you continue to be such a pigheaded person it would make sense for the csm to have meetings with 8 people.honestly, you make me sick for trying to ruin the first csm because of your own petty ego and i wished ccp never unbanned your sorry behind."
"um, what?"
"jade was banned from the forums for a significant amount of time(for doing pretty much exactly what he is doing here). a few months before taking sign ups for the csm ccp issued a blanket amnesty for all forum accounts that were not removed due to serious infractions(like posting goatse on the forums)"
"the way i see things it's not too late for jade. sure he's overstepped the mark and assumed far more power than he is legitimately entitled to, but the situation could be resolved if he accepted the following points:1. the chair has no right to veto.2. the chair has no right to exclude members from a meeting or a vote without the agreement of the council.3. the chair has no right to set the agenda or dictate procedures without the consent and support of the committee.4. the chair has no right to vote on any issue at all unless the ballot is tied and he is required to cast the deciding vote.if jade could accept those basic principles of democratic procedure then the problem would be solved."
"the chair is an equal voting member there is no reason to disallow him from partaking in discussion and voting. there are 9 people on the council and so long as the chair doesn't attempt to railroad the others and powergrab so that the csm does what he wants when he wants there is no problem with it.non-voting chairs are precautions that need to be taken in larger bodies where the sheer number of people make participation skew the process too much to also allow the chair to participate in discussions and vote on resolutions.it should not be needed here, and until its shown that such a system does not work with a reasonable person at in the chair its unreasonable to suggest it should be changed."
"this is precisely what is happening.no they are not. i've never been a member of a committee that allowed the chair a vote in any other circumstance other than a dead heat. the chair is supposed to be a neutral moderator and is normally extremely reluctant to reveal their position on any issue unless forced to do so in the event of a deadlocked vote. to do so in a real life political environment would be considered extremely unprofessional at best. oh i see. you don't want to resolve the issue amicably. you just want to get rid of jade no matter what. okay, that's a perfectly reasonable position to take, i guess. i was just trying to be diplomatic."
"i have. it went fairly well, but there were only 12 of us.no, if jade can be reasonable there is nothing wrong with jade being the chair. jade should only be removed if he cannot be reasonable. if there is anything \"not diplomatic\" its telling an elected member of the council their vote should only count in the event of a tie. we all know what happens when you tell an elected member of the council that their votes don't count. jade did it, and we have to deal with the fallout."
"hang on goum, point of order here. i think i should explain how forum bans used to work, just so people have the full background the olf forum ban thing.forum bans use to be issued after a set number of warnings. warnings did not expire over time. the longer a person participated on the the eve-o forums the more likely they were to rack up the warnings and thus be subjected to an infinite time ban.you have been around on shc long enough to know that back then a lot of the more active forum folks got hit with perma bans. it's part of the reason that shc was set up iirc.wasn't it three warnings and your out?"
"i've received one warning my entire time on the forums and i've been more prolific in terms of posts and words than most people(e.g. i have 40% more posts than jade with a higher average character count). you had to be pretty consistently abusive to receive enough warnings to get banned because of it. granted it could be \"light\" abuse. but its very unlikely for it to occur without that pattern of behavior. given jades posting here and elsewhere i am not surprised in the least that he was given an involuntary permanent vacation. especially since, in this environment, where we ought to be talking about stuff that is fairly in game politic neutral(in a game where we shoot each other and generally harbor ill will), and so you would expect the debate to be more tame than when you are talking about things like who won what engagement and who was winning a war, he has done little but insult others and insinuate about some conspiracy against him."
"iirc jade got banned for sig size violations not walls of texts"
"i am not getting drawn on this thread or discussion. i dislike the vitriol and hate these kind of things bring, it doesn't add to my enjoyment of the game.i just felt i ought to explain how things were a lot different then. a lot of people got banned for very little and it was a major bone of contention for most forum regulars, to the point that the mechanism was eventually changed."
"if there's anyone who has anything to gain from explaining how something works, it's jade. unfortunately, all he seems to want to do is run around the issue dismissively and throw insults at everyone.not to say you're a jade alt, but just that he could take the time to explain things without so much \"vitriol and hate\", as you put it."
"i dont think texas would want ya. i know i sure dont!and you said you hate darius. wow you hate another person over a video game? proof your in need of a real life. sure theres characters i dont like in this game. but i dont hate anyone in this game. prob because i know. behind the keyboard there not the same person they are in game. much like having the name jade and really having the name andrew. step down now make it rie. show you can realize your not for the good of the fgame and for only you personal powertrip as a roleplayer. give the chair to one whos willing to be impartial and is not going to see a goon at every turn!"
"jade, there's always room for you in my corp"
"speed is broken in 2 key areas.first, it is unusuable where appropriate. speed tanks are binary depending on whether you are webbed. this means small ships meant to benefit from speed cannot use it to get under large tracking and suchlike. webs need differentiation between classes, or possibly sig radius (with a possible \"falloff) to fix this.second, it is overly usable where inappropriate. it is the only viable option in small-gang pvp and obsoletes all others. this fact alone is sufficient evidence to warrant review at developer level. specifically reviewed should be the significance of signature radius in tracking, the significance of speed in missile hits and the stacking of multiple methods of speed augmentation, including overdrives, broken polycarbons, drugs, gang links and implants.so, i put it to the csm to raise this issue, if only for review and affirmation of its state as broken, or even non-broken if that's how you swing."

"well, your comment was that the sleipnir's cpu was horribly gimped, which is wrong. yes, the sleipnir is normally fit active, and from what i can gather camps seem to be split on active/passive tanking for the nh. but from what i can tell the sleipnir comes out ahead in both cpu and grid, regardless of active or buffer tank. no matter which way you look at it the nighthawk seems to kinda get the shaft on grid. i don't see how adding 150 or so grid would make the ship unstoppable. especially when the sleip would still have almost twice the grid left. yeah, i can use the grid for howies and still have plenty. but seriously, who fits howies on a sleip?"
"well presonally i don't think caldari ships are even designed to fit a mwd which causes most of the fitting problems. the issue of mwd's being a necessity is an issue for everyone.all i did was take a similar paragraph used about the nh and its pg and changed it to sleipnir and cpu, just showing how easy it is to make statements like that. posts such as"
"we had this discussion in the other thread. mwds are essential. period. if you don't share that opinion that's fine. however, take your no-mwd nighthawk and join some pvp op where everyone has them fitted and watch what their reaction.you're being a fool again. cutting and pasting a true statement for one thing doesn't a sound argument make for another thing. logic > you. if you dispute any fact in any of those posts then step up to the plate with your own numbers to dispute it.so your solution is to fix a lack of a by adding more b. brilliant. really. it has been shown here using solid numbers and facts that the nighthawk lacks grid. your solution is to add other things to make up for it. that isn't a solution, it's avoiding the problem. solving a problem with a ship doesn't elimate diversity.yes, the nighthawk's grid is most certainly horribly gimped. if you dispute that fact then provide some actual proof. not an opinion.the nighthawk's grid problem and bonus problem are two seperate issues. we are not trying to fix one with another. read the freaking thread. seriously.a. 50pg doesn't even come close to solving the problem. i've already shown that the nighthawk needs a base increase of 170pg in order to fit a very basic setup and a command module with the use of one rcu. any less and it'll require two fitting mods, while other command ships can fit the same setup with none. so, all i'm asking is that the nighthawk be required to fit one rcu while other command ships can fit the same setup with none. reread that several times. thanks.continued."

"you walked into this thread with your first post laughing at people and at the numbers they've provided. numbers and proof that are rock solid, and are far more convincing than your uninformed opinions. explain to me why on earth i should feel compelled to be considerate to you when your opening attitude was both derogatory and insulting. i have discussions with people who discuss. i mock and insult people who do the same. you have gotten and will continue to get what you deserve.you have yet to respond to my challenge. you have yet to provide proof, numbers, a setup, or anything approaching a fact that the nighthawk can live with less than half the grid of the sleipnir when both are fit very similarly.youll likely continue ignoring my posts as you dont have the consideration or maturity to admit that youve been wrong, or the facts to step up to my challenge. till then ill continue to be considerate to those who are worth consideration."
"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
"you need to justify these numbers, you can't just go around spouting numbers that look like they've been picked out of a hat.140 pg required - see here.an extra launcher slot is not required and, assuming a simultaneous pg fix, would overpower the nighthawk. missile precision bonus, ooh, yes please!the sleipnir is absolutely fine. it's a model for the other cs. the nighthawk's pg is unquestionably horribly gimped. again, you need to justify your opinions. like this, for example: i agree that the nh has problems other the pg - poor slot layout and the useless precision bonus. but the lack of pg is just so obvious, and so easy to fix."

"i havent flown the nighthawk, but fitting a high number of fitting mods for a cookie cutter fit is weird is a bit weird"
"sounds like a good idea."
"usually, a blockade runner gets shoehorned into fitting one of its lows with a power diagnostic or a rector control just to be able to fit a microwarp with the rest of the fitting.personally, i think its fair to give the crane a slightly increased powergrid so that the extra low is free for inertial stabilizers, nano, stabs, or whatever the pilot could possibly desire."
"i agree and would include ship cargo holds to be browsed.i have many ships in several regions and systems that i use for several reasons and sometimes i need to find something that i left inside a ship. (i once had to make a petition to find a missing skill)also, it would be very useful to have the info window of all ships in the station display the modules they have fitted, to avoid having to activate each one to see the fitting. (i can fly most t1 ships from all races and most t2 amarr ships and i can't buy faction gear for all of them, so i have to swap modules to the ship i need)"

"it is an annoying problem, as a player who flies solely amarr i understand.however, this is a bad idea. the entire idea of not allowing damaged products to be contracted is for a reason, because if these are contracted in a high sec system it adds an extra cost onto buying the product which is not explicitly included in the price.even if people know of the damage people will just ignore this and not really notice another \"are you sure you want to do this\" message. i oppose a general allowing of this sort, but i can see how when setting personal contracts (i.e. usually a corp or alliance mate or someone you know) that this may become useful, but setting it as a public setting will open it to abuse, which tbh ccp wont change since they are positive about scams/spies/thefts etc. it would be a system open to abuse, and if introduced should be in a private an not public arena."
"so everyone else should suffer because you can't be arsed to read a warning message? sorry but thats just being stupid"
"agreed"
"i believe this restriction exists to prevent people from foisting 99% damaged items on each other. that said, a better option would be to include damage amounts (if any) in the contract info. just like with all the other contract scams, the info would be there, and if you fall for it then that's tough. the gain far outweighs the scam potential here."
"getting rid of t2 laser crystal is the most painful thing ever."
"ime, that happens now, except that \"looking out the window\" is replaced with having a suicidal alt undock, or having a buddy in a cloaked ship sitting 100km from the station, giving a running commentary in corp chat.people already get around this restriction through various cumbersome means, so i'm arguing there's no real reason for it to exist. if an overview reproduction is excessive, then simply having a list of \"people on the station grid\" shouldn't cause more lag than local does."
"you are thinking of this from too much of an \"empire\" standpoint, empire station camping is a joke. in most 0.0 there is only one station. in any real 0.0 warfare enemies will be in your system all of the time, usually at a pos idling. you can't expect anyone to stay docked the whole time.even when the enemies are active there is a chance they won't be at the station because they are shooting at a pos or camping gates, or they are active but stuck inside their pos shield. you can't expect the defenders to stay docked just because there are enemies in the system.if the enemies are at your undock, and there are more than say, 20 of them, you can undock and slam \"stop\" all you want, you will not load the grid. all you will see is a black screen for probably a minute or two. in that time the people outside will have more than enough time to kill you and you will never, ever see it.that said, i don't really support the issue because i don't see a fair way to do it."
"i understand what you are thinking and why that would not make any sense on asking the station owner/traffic control as to see if the approach is clear.however in the context of just looking out the window for an object that might be close to 20 or 30km away in pitch black void, i am seriously doubting you will able to really know if you even were able to see it, to know if friend or foe with out your targeting system. now that's an avatar leaning on the window sill looking for bad guys.if you were able to see what is on grid, this will be nullified before the patch hits the game. 1) you will not be able to see cloaked ships on grid.2) all they need to do is park off grid and warp in as soon as you undock. and a cloaked sabres/hictor on the undock will really spoil your day.although a good thought, would be somewhat useless in practice."

"this idea is approved!does less dps at optimal (2-3km?) than other close range weapon systems... which means when you fight where you're \"supposed\" to, in falloff, you have even less dps. maelstrom isn't bad, but you trade that tanking bonus for a falloff, optimal, or tracking bonus and watch this ship take the biggest nosedive in history. typhoon is only good because 2/3rds of it's weapon systems are non-minmatar. astro"
"the major problem i see with auto cannons is this: they are geared to close/ medium range warfare, preferably with a ship which is faster than the opposition, which is why med ac's work so well on a vaga. however, this concept simply does not work when applied to battleships. you ever tried to outrun a mega mwding towards you? try to get around him, hoping his agility will allow you to get past? bs are simply too slow to use their range advantage, and with minmatar bs being as slow, big, and unwieldy as their racial counterparts, they have no advantage. please, i am sick of the argument having a bs is better than no bs - this is bs (pardon the pun)somebody pointed out there is not much difference between autocannon tiers - this is a problem, granted, but i would much prefer the larger problem to be solved, the impotence of the tempest. looking at hail, the halving of falloff, demolished tracking, means even if you do theoretical on par dps with a mega (lol) you will lose due to inferior tracking, range etc.hail makes no sense, because it dispenses with all the ac/minmatar advantages (unless your fighting another minmatar) - range (falloff reduced) and speed (tracking reduced).posting setups does not help your argument, anyone can see a dps mega will beat a dps tempest at optimal, but in practice if the tempest gets the range, who knows? of all this, i cant only say 3 things- a change to hail would be nice. maybe less damage, gives cap when firing? speed increase? who knows, you your imagination- difference in autocannon tiers, not much, simply make 800's do more dps, 425's less, whatever it needs to balance it, thats ccp's job to figure out- a change to the tempest. it has simply fallen out of its role. i think development as a sniper would be good, as minmatar have less viable options atm than other races. a change to artillery would compliment this (large, btw, others seem ok)"
"i agree that the ac's need some love. especially the 650mm and the 800mm would need to offer much more optimal to have a meaning of existence."
"i actually didn't need to read this entire topic to support it.bs ac's are shocking compared to their counterparts...same goes for arties as well to be fair!big support for this, though to be fair minmatar bs need to be looked at as they are sub-par to their opposites in other races."

"you've just clearly illustrated my point. thanks!"
"your point claims that i am a alt (im not) and that their are other reasons why ppl want bpo's removed. did you not read your own post?."
"it's amusing how you can say something and not know what you're talking about.the profit of something is determined by it's selling price. the selling price is determined by market conditions. you can put a t2 ship or item on the market for higher than the current price, but it probably won't sell all that quickly. that's what keeps your price lower to draw more consumer demand (because they don't want to pay more, and eve won't let them for that matter)you have a minimum amount you can sell it for before you actually realize a loss on your product. that's determined by the costs of manufacturing. if your costs are higher than mine and there's nothing you can do about it, the competitive advantage is in my court. this is what's known as the \"wal-mart\" effect. lower costs = lower prices with a profit = driving out of business those with higher costs.the safety margin for an invented ship (i don't know about modules) tends to vary by class, being the best for recon ships and the worst for most t2 frigates (the electronic attack ships are an exception to this because no t2 bpo exists).of course, inventors can understate their costs by treating their r&d agent datacores and explored decryptors as free, but that's not really sound economic sense."
"ok bud so you claim that even though the t2 market for years has been steady and the although plummet coincided exactly with the onset of invention that its the bpo owners that are driving it down. although for years the bpo holders had the sense to keep the market high suddenly they have decided to crash it?.the bpo guys and gals may be able to make a slightly higher profit than inventors but that profit does not effect in the slightest inventors or their profits as the market and demand is way to large (a fact you either ignored as it did not suit you and your point, or you were just ignorant of because of a lack of insight)."
"i said it before in the thread and i'll say it again. maybe this time you'll actually read it and understand it.back before invention, an oligopoly existed in the t2 market. an oligopoly is when there's a relatively small number of individuals or companies involved in a market, resulting in a limited amount of competition. there wasn't that much underbidding because there was a rather low number of people putting stuff up for sale.with the previous numbers i quoted, a vagabond would have cost 50m or so to build (possibly less, possibly more, i don't know what the component costs were) and were oftentimes selling for over 200m isk each. many t2 modules were priced upwards of 8-9x as high as they are now.the invention came in. the oligopoly came closer to a true free market, but not quite because not all of the 'players', so to speak, are following the same rules. those that have the advantage of lower costs of production enjoy an automatic boost over those that do not.the current situation is beneficial to the consumer, but it's not as equally beneficial to the sellers of the goods. these situations do happen in the real world, but it would be very difficult to think of anything approaching a magic money-making machine like a t2 bpo. the holders of the bpos do not make 'slightly higher profits'. hell, if i could find a company that could reliably make such 'slightly higher profits' in the real world, i wouldn't have to worry about working anymore and could just live off my investments in them.well, i guess i could invest in the oil companies right now, but they're a bit of an extreme and their long-term outlook isn't great, but that's irrelevant here.oh, and as for the rare event ships. there's one big difference between them and the t2 bpos. in order to take advantage of their significant powers and abilities, one would have to risk them in combat, either pve or pvp, which could end up with one less said rare event ship in the game. ask the ex-leader of iac about that. but a t2 bpo is different. they don't even have to be put into any risky situation to be used. it's less effective, but unlike ships, they still produce when they're being 'cargo bay queens', unlike hangarqueen ships that are never undocked."
"your missing the fact that nobody is saying that the t2 bpo guys cannot make more isk per sale on the ships they build from their bpo as they of course can without a doubt. but the fact is that the market is so large and varied that they do not effect the profits of a inventor in the slightest and to claim that they do is absurd."
"a still aspire to have enough isk to actually buy a t2 bpo, they are very available, maybe not often and maybe not the exact one you'd want, but they do sell, so please do not take them out of the game."
"obviously t2 bpo owners will be able to make larger profits than those who rely on invention, but you can still make a huge amount of isk through invention. you could then use this isk to purchase a t2 bpo.i'm not saying it's fair, but with no real feasible way of removing the t2 bpos, and with the introduction of invention vastly leveling the playing field, i don't believe anything has to be done."
"true, to a degree. but bpos do make the actual manufacture less of a hassle, and that convenience has a price. but i agree, i think most people voting to get rid of bpos are people who want them and don't have them."
"not just less of a hassle, but as i've said before, cheaper too.i don't want them to exist period and i don't have them. to me, they're basically subsidized t2 production when it doesn't need any. the demand for t2 items is quite obvious, so it's not like there's any need to make it cheaper to produce without good reason.the original t2 bpo program was heavily flawed, to put it kindly, and it's a relic of a poor design decision that's still having an effect today."
"give me the name of those mystical bpo giving 500% profit and how you get it, then i could think you are speaking the truth and give you my excuses, till then for me you are a liar or you aren't counting all the expenses. note: r.a.m., even if you produce them should be priced at sell price (or you will be moving the profit of building r.a.m. to the final item, and the profit come from building r.a.m., not the t2 items), idem for t2 building components, idem for all the other items used. if you are saying \"the basic materials/minerals cost x, so building all the components/advanced materials i am getting 500% profit on the final item\" you are simply adding the profits of several constructing jobs to the final job and calculating them there. in that situation it is not the t2 bpo what give you a 500% profit, it is the building of the components that give you a profit."

"hydrogen's threadnaughtthere have been numerous threads in regards to the pilgrim and it's ineffectiveness at its supposed role.personally, i wouldn't mind having a reduction in energy emissions capacitor use per recon level and a tanking bonus (remove the cyno bonuses, why use a 200-400 million isk ship to do what a 100k isk ship can do?)"
"what 100k isk ship can fit a covert cyno generator again?"
"any of the t1 frigates.edit: misunderstood, was thinking of the normal cyno generators."
"nah, the covert cynogen can only be fitted on covops, stealth bombers, recons, and black ops bs. none of which are 100k isk ships."
"so you admit that you've never flown a pilgrim. that's fine. i have flown a pilgrim. extensively. you think it needs to commit? yes, that's true if you want to utilize it's inherent bonus. but in order to commit, it needs a tank with which to survive, and that tank sucks (well, it's better than that of a t1 cruiser--with the exception of the maller--but compared to the damage output of things it's fighting, it sucks). unless you are attempting to take on a bs, the tracking disruptors have little to no effect within web range. and if you're trying to take on a bs, you'll run into their cap boosters + drones. if it's a raven, though, they'll likely end up popping you very fast--way faster than it will take you to break it's tank. so, given the info above, you pretty much need to keep out of range to be able to add almost anything to a fight. at 20km+, tracking disruptors are actually very good; if you run two, you can pretty much keep a vagabond or sleipnir from getting any good hits in. but if you fight at range, you can't make use of your neut bonus, so there's little point fitting them. you end up with a vexor with tracking diruptors that can also cloak. yay. with a range bonus, the pilgrim will be able to utilize all of its bonuses; even though it will be less effective than the curse, it can still swing a battle (which, at this point, is hard to do). the thing is, force recons in general give up combat effectiveness for the ability to cloak, but at least the other recons can still function in combat. the pilgrim is simply not cost-effective. it's hardly worth flying."

"okay before everyone freaks out hear me out. the way capships move is horrible. you can't do anything with out a chain of cyno's. the improvement with cyno's on towers was great but just a beggining to where it needs to go. i would purpose that with caps you can jump to any cestial body in a system. however i would make it so that a cyno comes up 30 seconds before you can jump in giving people some warning and stopping people from jumping massive fleets with out notice. i would also make it so a fleet would need a cyno to jump. that way you could stop massive fleets from moving with impunity. it would make caps ships easier to use on a personal basis but leave them needing help for massive movements. i understand ccp and devs desire to put a focus on teamwork. the focus should be in the area of combat and minning and stuff like that. when you are doing logistic and trying to move around then you should have the ability to do alot of that by yourself. if you are worried about things being unbalanced then you think about jumping a carrier in a system when you have no clue what is there. let me tell you it is not a good thought.stormdeath"
"so you favour capital ships having more strategic mobility and flexibility than interceptors and cov-ops ships combined? no."
"yase, empire miners and mission runners should have complete flexibility with their gravy train capital ships. anyone who actually uses them for pos warfare, well, you're sol."
"no support i'm afraid. capital ships are supposed to be a really big deal, with logistical hurdles to their operation. i think the current setup of using cynos to move them is reasonably balanced; they're not intended for solo work, and opening them up to more solo work would be dangerous. carriers, for instance, can already be used as solo pwnmobiles to some extent; we don't need to buff that ability further."

"the main problem with invention is that it is too reliant on chance and inventors do not have the avenues to research the me/pe levels like holders of t2 bpo's do.chance based invention is problematic due to the cost of a failed job. you stand to lose your bpc, datacores, decryptor and meta 4 item if the invention fails, and if it is successful you still can end up with a low run/low me/pe item depending on the decryptor use.my solution is to reduce the risk of inventing by removing all the decryptors from the invention process with the exception of the chance based decryptors (assembly instructions, installation guide , stolen formulas, war strategon). this will slightly lower the cost of invention and provide less risk to the inventor.the second part of this plan would be to allow the ability to research invented t2 bpc's through the use of the remaining decryptors much like t2 bpo researching requires items. you would also have the ability to add a limited number of runs onto the bpc through research with a penalty to me as with the current decryptors.tl;drinvention needs to be less chance based."
"lord yes. pve is entirely a caldari game, unless you feel like jumping through some pretty tall hoops. each faction should have at least one corp with highsec-only combat agents at each level - the faction navy at a minimum, maybe others as well. and caldari shouldn't have eleventy billion l4 q>0 agents sitting in nice safe highsec. break them up, ship them out. it'd probably even kill a decent part of the lag around motsu long-term, since people won't be forced into flying for caldari. also, give caldari some good lowsec agents, like the l4 q20 0.1-sec agents that most of the other factions get. a caldari pilot shouldn't be forced highsec for missioning any more than an amarr pilot should be forced lowsec."

"ding! wrong again, oh great one. the chair does have authority. authority to moderate meetings. i know this vexes you fiercely, but it's the way things are. suck it up, accept reality and respect the authority for what it is. mere administrative duty.moderating the csm meeting in no way means that jade is your superior. as you are fond, very fond, of saying, \"you're all equal on the council\". don't worry. nobody contests this.windjammer"
"oh.....and i do not regret who i voted for and, no, it was not jade. i'm very pleased with the choice i made and in light of events to date would not hesitate to make the same choice again.windjammer"
"you're still speaking about things you don't know about. see this very forum for an example of that change re: rotating moderators."
"yeah darius is right on this one. i think we all agree now that that rotating moderation responsibilities and letting people introduce their own issues and get a turn running the debate is a good thing. it has been a bit experimental and random so far but i'm going say right now that i'm happy for darius to handle moderation responsibilities on his own issues and if we can come to some kind of agreement to make it work i'd be happy see a fully rotating chair with us all sharing the moderation burden.either that or completely outsource the chair role to a ccp appointed non voting moderator. i'm really not interested in stupid admin power struggles - i just want to see our issues get promoted correctly and the csm to be a success. and as the actual csm reps have all calmed down and come to agreement on this point this week i'm pretty confident it'll happen.the chair position never really had any actual \"power\" / its just a lot of responsibility and hard work really, same as the secretary roles - every argument we've had this week has been a storm-in-a-teacup blown up to ridiculous proportions by the jerry-springer factor of doing this all in public for an audience of bored internet spaceship geeks :)*in which category i suspect a lot of csm fall as well."
"voted for darius, expected the csm to do nothing, got a bunch of drama, am happy with my vote."
"i think jade needs to be reported for eula violations - specifically, sharing his password. there's no way our friendly neighbourhood andrew cruse would say that darius is right seriously though, if this can be worked out, i'm entirely in favour. anything that makes this committee function is a good thing."
"voted for bane, am very glad"
"i for one hope that there isn't a \"next time around.\"ccp seem to be wasting valuable resources on something that so far has created nothing more than a group of arguing players with gold avatars beside their name on a forum."
"verone, what exactly did you expect to happen? did you think we were going to cure cancer and stop all war in the world? csm has only been in place for about a month or so. we have only just sent off the initial agenda for iceland.so verone, how can you judge something so soon? yes, there has been some issues. but that was really to be expected.do you also go \"god damn this computer is crap lol\" before you even plug in the motherboard in a new computer?edit: now that i think about it, i believe i made this point on a podcast once. what is going to make csm fail is not csm itself. csm would have to fail pretty damn epicly and have the whole csm banned in order for that to happen.what is going to be the death of csm is people with unreasonable expectations."
"if this was the real plan then i would call it a complete failure... i think darius johnson has done a whole lot better then i would have expected... in fact the csm has done quite well for the first time around, with luck, things will get better."
"no, but what i expected you all to be able to do is treat the players you're representing with at least a small amount of courtesy.i also expected that the csm would work together, rather than lock horns on the forums like a pack of children in order to see who looks the toughest and meanest.finally i expected you all to be able to hold a meeting without it degrading into childish bickering resulting in people who're at the meeting to give their viewpoints being muted and unable to do so.all of these things the csm has failed horribly to do.no, i make sure that i buy the correct components, and that i know what i'm getting before i assemble a machine so that i'm not dissapointed.i fail to see how my expectations of you people to do what you were elected to do are in any way unreasonable or excessive.at present all i've seen from the csm is sets of meeting minutes that discuss very little, a loose and incomplete agenda for a meeting that takes place in two weeks, and a group of players who've been elected throwing childish insults at eachother across a forum and throwing their weight about in meetings with heavy handed and overzealous moderation.to be honest, ccp is wasting their money. it would have been much better spent in keeping the eve-tv weekly show alive, something that like the csm was unique, but unlike the csm actually strengthened the bonds between players, gave rival corporations something to talk about and gave eve something no other mmo has.at present, eve has what every other mmo has, a bunch of players (albeit with pretty pointless little badges beside their names on a forum) that are arguing and bickering like children.sorry mate, it doesn't float with me. this term for the csm has already failed at it's job in my opinion."
"verone, i both agree and disagree with you.i do agree with you that the behaviour so far is a fiasco. but we have made progress. the last meeting was a bliss. we have recently send off a large list of issues to ccp for us to discuss at iceland.but i think the difference between you and i is that your requirements for csm to be good is that the council works great together. while i definitely see your point and to a large degree agree with you, i think what really matters is that we make progress and that the council manages to make a difference and push forward the interest of the playerbase."
"it's not the job of the csm to push forward the interests of the player base. it's the csm's job to discuss and vote on issues that affect the majority of the players, and will benefit them. a consequence of this discussion and vote is that some issues have to be addressed by ccp.can you tell us how many issues in total were forwarded to ccp (not topics, but individual issues)?can you also tell us how many of those issues affect the majority of eve players?how much time, in total, was taken to discuss the pros and cons of the issues before voting in meetings?how much interaction and discussion did you and other csm members have via the forums on the specific issues?take care,bruce hansen"
"oh, shnap, we have spies?! woah."
"yes. if darius had wanted it to be solely bane, he (darius) would have dropped out. therefore, darius changed his mind from his original desire. here's something to ponder. if darius had dropped out, bane would now be the chair of the csm instead of jade. kind of makes you think. at risk of being called psychic, i'll venture that goonswarm will forward just one candidate next csm election. however, there's always the chance goonswarm will be smarter than that.i mean jumping up and down like a red faced child during his attempt to block a vote in the first csm meeting. i mean engaging in a fleet battle during the second csm meeting (couldn't be bothered to give his full attention to the meeting. he's much to important for that.). i mean trying to fan a bad situation into a fire in the third meeting by acting in the same rightously indignant fashion as he did in the first meeting. and i mean his, and goonswarms, consistent and perpetual attempts to blow incidents from the csm out of proportion using these forums as a tool to do so.there were several in the third csm meeting who \"stood up to the chair\" as you put it. only darius johnson found it necessary to have a tantrum both there and on the forums. frankly, with darius to base a measurement of goonswarm on, bane comes as a surprise.regards,windjammerp.s. i might be reading your text incorrectly in terms of tone, but you seem surprisingly civil. are you sure your heart is in this defense of your current ceo?"
"that's too x fileish. you may expect a reprimand from your glorious ceo.windjammer"
"i've already said that it may be our intention to forward just one candidate. you're neither astute, clever or psychic for repeating such. i doubt it will be necessary though as i suspect the value of the term \"chair\" has changed significantly.you're free to characterize my actions however you like, however i was not \"engaging in a fleet battle\" during the second meeting. bane said i was. i said clearly \"i am here\" in the chat channel. i was however in a lagged system causing a delay. a fact i'd made mention of in the beginning of the meeting. and re: goonswarm again, you editorialize and you do so horribly. goons or anyone else is well within their rights to say whatever they like. don't let those facts get in the way of your neverending bluster and bull**** however."
"i'll chalk it up to ***** envy.windjammer"
"that's actually not the goonswarm i remember. right to trash post doesn't equal right to say whatever you want.the goonswarm i was in, one was free to do and say whatever you wanted, as long as you:1) never questioned the directorate;2) never questioned, or even just tried to discuss or get a clarification on war strategy;3) never let your burning hate for bob be doubted by making a balanced statement about them.also it was wise to adhere to expected communication patterns:a) post in memes and one liners (this even applied to the war room on the gf.com forums)b) serious communication was generally something to be frowned upon. it wasn't needed after all, as the directorate in their fathomless wisdom already facilitated all the necessary thought process among themselves. you just had to x up.c) there are only allies (all super friends), enemies (to be meta hated) and pubbies (worthy of contempt). your outside communication had to reflect this.i would like to remind you of the goon who dared to deviate from said communication patterns, and was ordered to facilitate his own banning from eve-o (he posted close up pictures of a certain orifice and was perma banned, not only from the forums but also from the game, for this).goonswarm may have changed a little bit for the better since these days (probably due to the disappearence of the mittani) but events like the witch hunt on jade or the recent readmission of cippalipus primus in your ranks make me somehow doubt about the extent of this."
"i'm sorry you don't agree with the administration of the corp you are not a member of. v0v be bitter about it."
"it's not about my agreement with how goonswarm runs his business, but about the public picture you recently try to paint of your alliance.or let me put in simple words, perhaps more suitable to your part of the audience:it'a about calling you on your bull****."
"and what bull**** would that be? you quoted me saying goons can post whatever they want. they can. where's the bull****?"
"no they can't. i listed topics that were taboo or at least frowned upon. if they did so anyway: they were either outright banned, or, on a minor offense, ridiculed by the mob, with the backing of the directorate, for it.i also gave a more prominent example of how unwelcome posts were suppressed by degrading one of your own members into banning himself from the eve-o forums (and accidentally from the game itself).truth is that you indeed have many freedoms in goonfleet you don't have in other corps/alliances, but the truth also is that when it comes to blind mass following mentality it's also one of the worst."
"you gave an example that is simply not true today. i can't speak for the past. i am not trying to speak for the past in this regard. at the least since i took over goons have been free to say whatever they like. i'm pretty sure it was the same under sesfan. tell me again what people in the corp you're not in and i'm ceo of are allowed to do."
"i've been posting i hope we lose for a long time and haven't been banned :)maybe you are shinori?"
"haha. i laughed at this, because i couldn't stand shinori myself also shinori wasn't banned because he begged to differ, but because he was even by goon standards a giant douche, if i'm rightly informed.so in this case i have to give mad props to whoever banned him."
"gosh. you really put me in my place, huh? neither the position or term of \"chair\" has changed. it never was what you feared it to be. it never was a position of power. it never made jade more important than you. you've really had a phobia about that. repeating the chant, \"we're all equal\" and having to be constantly reassured on that count have not helped your image. the image of a frightened child concerned that he'll cease to become the center of attention.i appreciate you giving me freedom to continue to characterize your actions. i already possess this freedom, but it's amusing to see you think yourself important enough to grant it. keep it up and your hats aren't going to fit.let's be clear on what you did in the second csm meeting. first; you made excuse for your lagged responses, which wasted time for the csm meeting, by saying you were in a war lagged system. it was promptly suggested you move and that in the future csm members avoid situations during csm meetings such as you put yourself in. second; bane announced you told him you had just warped into a fleet battle and suggested voting be delayed while you were in that situation. to your credit you did, after a few moments, tell the meeting you were there and did not ask for special consideration. i call that engaging in a fleet battle. even if you were just observing it still lagged you more. you were in a war lagged system and instead of getting out of that system you went further into lag by warping into the battle and that, darius, demonstrates a lack of full attention to the csm meeting which is what i said.you really should look up and attempt to gain a better understanding of the words you try to use. words like \"editorialize\" and \"truth\". i understand you heard/read ank use the term editorialize and i'm sure it looked like a big word to you and that's what tempted you to use it. however, using a word you don't fully understand only makes you look more like the little boy in his fathers too large shoes and hat proudly pronouncing himself to be a \"big boy now\". as far as the word \"truth\"? you haven't a clue as to the concept.re: freedom within goonswarm. absolutely. members of goonswarm have the freedom to be or say anything they wish. additionally, they have the freedom to be harassed, belittled and attacked for it. they get to be called \"traitor\", \"coward\" and \"spy\" and on occasion they even get to be blown up. ahhhhh.......freedom........feels good, doesn't it? here's an interesting little concept for you. peer pressure. look it up.windjammerp.s. the more i read from you, the happier i am that you've assumed control of goonfleet."

"there are a lot of good ideas, but many fail the 'benefit the majority of eve players' requirement. unfortunately, these also make it through meetings. a firmer application of requirements rather than a focus on getting as many ideas to ccp as possible (whilst ignoring requirements/discussion and unclear explanation of the actual issue).when good ideas that met the requirements are voted on, the csm can be said to be being effective. simply by taking a lot of issues to ccp won't meet this criteria.take care,bruce hansen"
"this requirement cannot conceivably be that each individual issue must benefit the majority of eve players, because i can only think of about three issues that actually would(ui fixes, lag fixes, and subscription fee reductions), and two of those aren't topics the csm can reasonably bring up. this game is way too fractured to have a majority interest in much of anything. if i'm not mistaken, it was a requirement that the csm process as a whole should benefit the majority of players, which is a completely different requirement."
"it's pretty evident from the documents really;the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp. this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base.and...the key question that council members must consider before casting their vote is whether or not the issue at hand has the potential to improve or otherwise benefit the entire eve society, and not just a select group within the communitythat was successful in bringing attention to their unique case.it's also pretty clear that representatives must;engage the populace on all issue debates and discussions and candidates are expected to be active on the csm forums and participate in the discussion of topics. and this requires active engagement with the player communityactive discussion and engagement on issues seems to have slipped past the majority of representatives!take care,bruce hansen"
"its their personal interests and/or that of their buddies/corp. the only way you can force a issue through is by getting 5% of eve to vote on it, and the chances of that happening is small. even then the chances of getting csm to spend any real effort on it is slim to none."
"while i wont comment on the issue itself its pretty obvious that more controversial \"issues\" with far less support have been pushed through as it was in the interest of a csm member."
"i think that isn't true.i have personally been writing up submission templates for things like the colourblind issues and the mac/linux clients. i'm neither colourblind nor do i use mac/linux.so how can you say it's personal interest? none of my friends have asked me to take up certain issues either. if they did, i would probably tell them to screw themselves and ask them to go write a post on the forum.i can of course only talk on my own behalf. i can't deny some council members are looking out for their own interest. but you should certainly not expect for that to be true for all members."
"i do agree on that point. things like.. lets see. destructible outposts shouldn't even have been taken onto the agenda because of the extremely low support %. but a member sponsered it. so well"
"the members got their votes also for the issues they have put on their flags in their running campaigns.the votes for each of the csm members are far higher than the support in any(?) single-issue-thread till now."
"i'm still trying to get my head around why there's so many meetings.they're coming as little as three days apart. what's the deal? why not just hold longer meetings and get things done, rather than spending a couple of hours bickering and asking people to come back in 3 days, then rinsing and repeating the process?i've seen more organised riots tbh."
"well such things as colorblind issues and linux clients or many of the simple ui adjustments are very easy to support as it doesnt have any real impact on the game itself. they also require a very low amount of input from the csm. as such they cant really be compared to changes such as the changes the op proposed. from your campaign and the issues you supported its easy to see you are mostly interested in market related changes that will benefit you and others in your situation. nothing wrong with that, as it is expected and what you seem to know best. but then changes that fall outside the interests of those 9 elected members will naturally be overlooked. as such the issues the csm will spend time on is largely determined by the csm members personal interests. but then its up to the voters to vote on someone that will be interested in the same issues as them. politicians never represent the people, only special interest groups. one just hopes that with enough special interest groups represented the politicians cover a larger amount of the population."
"yes such things ruin what little faith people have in the csm program."
"our meetings are usually 1 week apart. but due to having to submit the agenda, we have had an extra meeting. as for longer meetings, it's a challenge with both us and eu crew, at least during week days. during weekend, there's no reason other than how much we can get onto the meeting at any given time."
"people were told that if they were to apply to be a candidate then they'd need to dedicate the time to be able to do what's asked of them.i don't see this as a vaild argument tbh. if people want to be on the csm, they should make sure they have the time and the chair should make sure the meetings are organised so that under regular circusmstances everyone is able to attend."
"i have to agree totally with verone, and i've said as much elsewhere. you stood (as others also did) fully aware of the commitment you would need to give. if you can't give this commitment, withdraw and let one of the alternates that can take your place. it's that simple. meetings take time, and when you start to discuss an issue it might take an hour or two to come to the point where everyone can make an informed vote. start putting just issues that affect the majority of eve players onto the agenda, and your meetings may get a little shorter....take care,bruce hansen"
"oh, i do agree with you. and i have till this point attended all meetings even though i didn't have the time. but i did take the time to attend all meetings.but still, lets not forget that in some cases people just wont be able to attend and i think we have to respect that."
"if that continues to be true, and i've not seen that yet on anything important and game-changing, just some bureacracy internal to the csm, then that is not the fault of the 'system' but of the chair and those who elected that chair.grandstanding and complaining about the entire damn system being broken sounds very grand, but the truth is, the system works, it's who you get into the system that can be gamed. oddly enough and i do find it mildly ironic, you're busy levelling the same criticisms that quite a few levelled when those from goonswarm ran in the first place (that it'd be run by the goons for the goons etc.).after all, 6 months from now, jade is no longer chair, and so the system solves that particular issue anyway. personally i'd wait to see the transcript from when they actually have to do these things in person; amazing what a bit of face-to-face meeting can do."
"i want to see the csm working also. however, it will never be really successful until the csm stops the preoccupation with voting on issues to be escalated to ccp. by this, i mean the following;a. issue (not multiple issues) presented in a clear and well thought out manner on the forum in assembly hall.b. issue, after 7 days of discussion, is free to be raised by a representative for discussion in a meeting. this means if it has been on forums for 7 days, it can be raised- regardless if it is on the agenda or not. obviously for a csm advance warning via an agenda is desirable, so everyone on csm can become familiar with issue and the arguments etc.c. issue is raised in a csm meeting. obviously some 'personal' issues and small-group issues will make it to this stage. d. the issue is discussed and the arguments for and against it heard. consideration of the issue in light of the requirement that it must affect the majority of eve players needs to happen here. if it doesn't meet the requirement, it should be voted out.e. representatives vote on the issue, taking into consideration d above. f. a consequence of a successful vote by majority is that the issue is presented to ccp. this is a consequence, not the prime goal of the csm vote.at present, i think that the some csm members have forgotten about what their goal is; not to present as many issues to ccp as possible, but to decide which issues affect the majority of eve players and are actual issues which are important to be given further consideration.it is not the job of the csm to decide or suggest possible fixes, but highlighting why the issue is an issue worth ccp consideration with examples is probably good practice to clarify it.currently, step a is poorly done (not just by csm members, but also by players). take care,bruce hansen"
"good argument, signed.there do need to be changes in game mechanics involving looting and salvaging wrecks, and this is definitely one of them.of course, i think it should expand to salvaging wrecks not belonging to you as well, because - after all - it is 'stealing' in a sense and should be dealt with accordingly.tchell dahn, i don't think it's you or your corp that would be the ones that do the killing, i think you guys fall on the other side of the spectrum."

"yes the overall trend is the erosion from the base price, an average of 33% across the board, but as only 1 effectively out of the 16 have not fallen (trit), without the rises it shows a 45% decreace on average. mercoxit could also be left out as its a t2 not a t1 base item and at a -72 from base it may give an indication that base price may have lost it's meaning or the market is well over supplied. the question as i see it is really; as supply and demand set the price why is veldspar in short supply (high price) even though it is the most plentful of ores in the lowest risk areas (high sec)?. if supply was plentliful it would be following the overall trend, which has to be downward as the base ammount present of everything in new eden is always being added too no matter how many ships get blown up, the available quantity grows daily. veldspar is the basis of life and source of all profit, maybe chribba has it sussed with the veldnought, people see no glamour sitting in high sec chewing veld even though thats where the money is, it could be a simple as that!"
"it's all about opportunity cost. on average, as time goes on, more and more people will do whatever it is that gets them more cash in the long run, if the risk levels are relatively the same... or might take on a higher risk if the reward is proportional. is mining veldspar better than running l3 mission at your skills ? you'll mine veldspar. is ratting in the drone regions more profitable than mining arkonor in some 0.0 ? you'll rat in the drone regions. is running l4s in highsec better than ratting in some 0.0 ? you'll run l4s in highsec. and so on and so forth, given equal risk levels, more and more people will do whatever is more profitable.yes, exceptions exist, people that keep doing whatever it was they were doing without checking and re-checking (like, for instance, people mining jaspet in lowsec like crazy, because they used to do that for a good profit a long time ago, and they didn't bother veryfing if it's still the case), but like i said, on average, more people will do the more profitable things, and a lot less the less profitable ones.and to answer your \"why\" question more clearly : because the only reliable and sufficient source of tritanium in the vast quantities that tritanium is required (compared to the other minerals) is mining veldspar.want pyerite ? there's a vast surplus of pyerite from mission-runners and people reprocessing npc-sold items that contain both tritanium and pyerite, as they need tritanium but have no use for the pyerite.want nocxium or megacyte ? there's a vast surplus of all of these coming over from the drone regions, slightly less megacyte lately, so it corrected a litle bit.mexallon was very high for a while, as it was needed in significant quantities in the drone regions. as a little bit of megacyte was replaced by a chunk of mexallon in one of the alloys dropped there, megacyte prices rose and mexallon prices dropped.and so on and so forth, for each rise and fall of mineral prices, there's always a trivial explanation on how changes made by ccp, and only those changes alone fully explain all the deviations in price of individual minerals."
"i don't totally agree with some of the solutions suggested, but i do very strongly agree that this is one area that could use some attention so i'll support the idea anyways."
"ok in order1* ok first off how the hell do you plan to impliment this given the kind of database they use? never mind that, this solution is so childishly simple to game its rediculous, simply set up in one of the bascialy empty stations in low-00 and swap say veldspar at 1,000,000,000 per to put artifical preasure on that mineral to drive the price down, or if you want help freeze people out, just endlessly trade thousands of nocxium at .01 per thus causing the bps to suddenly demand more nox. the second problem? it does nothing about the seemingly ever growing supply of minerals. lets face it, given the combined fact of improving me = fewer minerals used with the reality that between improved skills and better modules and better ships running missions, theirs more minerals hitting the marketplace the other problem with this idea? its a (surprisingly lame) attempt to price fix. bascialy what your trying to do akita is casping your little producerce hat in your hand and begging ccp to please please please make it so that nothing can sell for under this price because if anyone does their only cutting there own necks.2* (sigh) where do i even start with this one. . .a: again, how the hell do you plan to do this with eves database? first, every time you creat a \"new\" bpo with this system your actualy creating a new basetype in the reference database. both the normal bpos, the researched bpos, and the bpc all refer to the base type in the database after all. second, how often do you do this to the reference database, daily? weekly? monthly? once a year? with the system they use the fewer calls and searches on it the better, and the smaller you can keep it (the basetype database) the better. thirdb) what about the person with the older and now mutch more expensive (or cheeper depending on how prices go) bpo? force them to buy a new one perhaps?c) incidentaly you also managed to combine the problems with your previous sugestion!3) ok so you bascialy want to just spread out and randomise moon resources a bit more?, bascialy thats just going to **** off the people who have the monopolies, (see the never ending arguments about why people were allowed to keep their t2 bpos once they put invention into the game) and force people to go looking for other moons to work because some of the moon they have are suddenly worthless, and odds are some of thoes moons will be just like they are, left undeveloped because its still not cost efective to mine 1 unit of the current high priced mineral a day. (yes their are moons with no poses by them for whatever reason)4) ok first off, taking away the rewards from mission runners-ratters plex runners is generaly considered to be a non starter, second, a better idea might be to shift respawn on roids based on the maket value"
"the mineral prices you're using are slightly different than the ones i based my numbers off, but sure, we'll use yours. what is wrong with any of those numbers? as i said above, and in a couple other threads, lowsec needs a boost, but the values seem to line up well with the risks aside from that. the only problem i see here is that you're treating \"base prices\" like they mean anything - to my understanding, they're relics from a half-decade ago when ccp was trying to manage the economy. delete the \"base prices\" columns from all your tables, and you'll get an accurate representation of the real situation. their only actual utility is in insurance calculations, and that needs to change to a market-based system instead of a fiat-based system. i've got a thread on that very topic lurking in these forums. so you're advocating that we make bad items more expensive. i'm generally opposed to that - i like the fact that newbies can fit up ships for dirt cheap. you're also suggesting that we remove a sizable proportion of the income from combat with npcs - i do l4 missions, and i'd say unnamed loot drops are somewhere between 10% and 20% of my income. you seem to dislike the fact that ccp changes cost/benefit ratios for various activities, but are encouraging it in this case because it fits in better with how you want the game to look. i could conceivably support this, but i'd need hard data suggesting that the reason for certain minerals being dirt cheap is that reprocessing is fulfilling the vast majority of the demand, not just supposition."

"where do i start ?first off, you assume that i meant some automatic method of adjusting prices on a daily basis or somesuch. i certainly didn't mean that, but ok, let's even assume for a second that this would indeed be the case.considering your presented \"exploits\", the outliers (materials traded far above or far below recent averages, or traded volumes far above regional averages in a single location and so on) can easily be discarded for this calculation's purposes. in the case of low-valued minerals, setting an insanely high price means you lose quite a lot on trade taxes, so i can only question the utility even if those prices wouldn't be filtered out ; in the case on high-valued minerals, you either have to spend a lot of time (and taxes) in order to slowly adjust regional average prices and average volumes, while risking that somebody could just come in and swipe all your low-brow orders, or you are easily filtered out because your prices are insignificant. either way, what i actually meant by \"slowly/constantly\" was \"every week/month, somebody from ccp will look at things and decide what this week's/month's adjustments should be, if any, to some high-demand product blueprints\". it makes sense from multiple perspectives : you tweak the least amount of blueprints so it's not a big deal to follow in patchnotes, but you generate the most impact on the mineral market, also, as you only slightly, but often tweak them, it even sort of follows rp-wise (those in high demand get \"improved\" by the empires in terms of cost-effectiveness).to your \"second problem\" and third \"other problem\", nothing you can possibly do with mineral price ratios will do anything about the \"ever growing supply of minerals\". as long as the insurance system remains in place, the aggregate price of minerals in the average ratios used in ship construction will always hover somewhere above 70% of the base price of the same aggregate. so it would be at best a futile attempt to even try to \"solve\" this problem in any other way except reducing insurance payouts... but i'm pretty sure some people would be insanely upset in case that's ever going to happen.it's pointless of you to claim i would have some vested interest in keeping goods above or below a certain price, when insurance already does it marvellously... and in case insurance would go away and these changes proposed would go live (fast and often), the end-result would be a lowering of prices, not an increase.still, i don't see insurance getting any changes any time soon, so your two \"issues\" here are completely moot."
"a: you couldn't possibly know all that much about databases, because if you did, you wouldn't say that. in this particular case, of a type addition, the added computing requirements are minimal, if even noticeable at all in case no instances of it are spawned... and in case any are instanced, it would be not more cpu-intensive as instancing just about any other item type.b: nobody's forcing them to do anything. and given enough time (not that long, actually), the fact that the output products are identical, market forces will cause the two blueprint variants to end up being equally valuable. the only advantage anybody will have will be for those who buy the alternative blueprint and use it massively before the opportunity to use it at higher profits has passed. translation, not a problem at all.c: i'm not exactly sure what you mean by this... that is to say, i fail to see a connection between what's been said so far by either of us and this remark here by you. maybe you could explain what you mean or just drop it altogether in case the above answers have cleared things up."
"you mush have misunderstood this quite badly too.the original moon material distribution ratios would remain exactly the same as they are right now, or would even be boosted, if anything.all that happens is that most other moon materials will be added to all moons in very small quantities.so, for instance, instead of having an extractor that extracts exactly 100 units per hour, you could have extraction rates anywhere from 1 to 100 or even from 1 to 500 per hour, depending on concentration.the whole point is that overall, adding all concentrations of all of one type of material, the ratios of totally available/moon-mineable materials should be almost identical to the overall requirement ratios in the whole industry.this would still keep the moons that are now valuable the most valuable (even boost their value a bit in case due to concentration one allows more than just 100 units to be extracted hourly), but will be adding some value to a lot more moons that previously had next to none.yes, a lot of moons that only extract 1 dysprosium per hour will probably be left alone in the long run... but then again, at the current prices, that's almost 60 mil isk per month, so you'd be silly not to mine it as long as prices keep so high. after a while, when dysprosium, promethium, neodymium and thulium all start settling in roughly the same price range, the moons with just traces of dysprosium will either be abandoned or switched to mine something else instead on the same moon, something that gives a better profit per hour.this way, you get a self-regulating system while at the same time maintaining value differences.\"first off\", you have a bit of trouble understanding the concept of how mineral prices fluctuate, it seems. no, the *overall* value of the loot and alloys a ratter/missioneer will be getting not be changing significantly in this whole set of changes, just like how a raven doesn't change value regardless of how each individual mineral fluctuates. all that would change will be where exactly they're getting their value from, in terms of mineral in the reprocessable loot.\"second\", just moving ores around willy-nilly wouldn't solve all that much. so, what do you really plan to do, move veldspar to lowsec, for instance ?you do realize that by doing that, you create a lot more problems than you solve ?!?veldspar prices would go up even further. then what, move it to 0.0 only ? that's just silly."
"i understand about opportunity cost, but if they have the isk then no matter what the price of trit is they will pay as they can afford it, keeping set prices and static differentials be buggered, veld/trit in short supply so pay noobs to mine it in 1.0. large corporations don't worry about minerals, they can go strip a system to meet their building requirements, they don't need the market, cost don't really matter to them, they are a collective and their existance is strenght through co-operation in all things, if they can't get enough trit or maon about relative worths they are poorly inspired, managed and motivated tbh. what segment of the player population actually buys minerals and ores off the market, traders, industrialists, pvp corps and pod pilots who have no mining (refining) skills, opportunists and ppl who make time value judgements on how to wipe thier arses based on how l33t they think they are (/sounding like a goon) in a game they can never win.as they don't have the skills or feel its below them to work at the roid face for little reward in the saftey of 1.0 they deserve to pay well over the odds for it, they made a decision that sitting in jita undercutting by 0.01 while waiting on their science and industry job lines to complete when they could be in a hulk nice and safe in 1.0/0.9 mining veld and remotely manipulating them and contributing to their botton line even more (ok thats just a rant not an actuality.. or is it?). drops put only 10% of minerals in the game at best, i'm sure ccp have an exact value, they are not tweaking drops/loot so they don't think its a problem as its a very easy thing to do. the ore price differentials you give are still remaining basically the same in relation to each other to a great degree its just veld that is under supplied and so up in value.if veld is a bottleneck so be it, its a market driver that helps new players to make isk to pay for books etc, new players are the reason for insurance in the first place, thier losses and lack of profit opportunity literally makes the game unattractive to play for them so its mitigated/compensated. base price must go to be replaced with daily universial mean and insurance should be linked to that.again i say its presently a perceived not a real issue and it is under devolopment within a much larger framework which is not yet advanced or stable enough for announcement, the time scale on stuff like this is long as its complex to get it right and presentable so it can be announced and greeted with a \"about time, good work, can't wait for it\" player reaction."
"so, wait, you're telling me that veldspar, the most widely available (and on the intended baseprice listing the least valuable) ore being 40% more valuable (on average, in hubs up to 60% more valuable) than the base, and relatively up to 75% more valuable overall than the \"basket\" (or, double in hubs) is not a problem ?or the fact that it's equally valuable to one of the rarer, limited-availability bottom highsec ores (kernite), one that's supposed to be 2.6 times more valuable than veldspar ?or, heck, the fact that it's more valuable than two lowsec-only ores (jaspet, hemorphite) that are supposed to be 2.8, respectively 3.35 times more valuable ? damn it, even the last remaining valuable lowsec ore (hedbergite) is barely worth 20% more, when it's supposed to be *3.75 in value !screw that, what about spodumain, a 0.0 only ore, which should have been worth almost 4.8 times more, and it's now barely worth a bit over 50% more ?!?yeah, \"all is fine\", my ass..."
"yes it's not a problem, its a reflection of lack of supply, its the limiter to a degree on production, you said your self its the most plentiful ore in existance, but it is expensive as ppl don't mine it enuf to meet demand, it stays locked in a rock. the market has spoken, it is in low supply (not enuf miners) so it carries rariety value even though its everywhere.as i said before, base price (and to a lesser extent differentials) is not a guide to anything apart from the day it was written on a web page, eve ecomonics are player driven within basically unlimited resources (we are only talking about roids here so don't start on moons), its our choice to gravitate towards x or y, we do what we think is sexy and will provide fun/profit.take a look at chribba, the \"king of veldspar\" he has more intelligence in his little finger than we have collectivly as he was wise enough to know ppl won't mine veld as its not thought of as sexy and its the limiter of supply as so much is required, he's win win. alliances control all the high end stuff that resides in null sec and to a lesser extent low sec, they could force the price up of basic high end ores and minerals if they formed an effective cartel or cartel groups to control supply (think oil industry). if they made sure only very limited supplies of zydrine or morphite reaches the empire market they could cripple empire totally, the potential for it to happen is there, the game mechanics exist to do it, but, it doesn't happen (it could if so many ppl didn't polish thier e-peen by meta gaming), should that be changed?"
"yup, that's exactly what i'm telling you. you have this strange obsession with irrelevant numbers pulled out of a dev's ass in 2002, and it's leading you horribly astray when you look at the market as of 2008. none of those ores are \"supposed to be\" worth more than any other - there's size, refine amounts, and availability, and the prices follow from that. it's like saying that pork is supposed to be worth twice as much as beef, because of a government agriculture subsidy established in 1930, and then complaining about how out of whack the market is when pigs cost half as much to raise and slaughter. the flaw here isn't with the free market, it's with your command-economy baseline."
"not signed, pilgrim is the large bubble/ammo hauler in gang."
"[no support]so, let's see. those peeps who want to scrap the learning skills are (generally) using the reason that they are a waste of time! fine, have ccp return your sp's, but at the same time have them reduce your attributes respectively. you seem to want the benefits of the higher attributes without having to expend the time it takes to get them there. put simply, you want a quick-fix, 'i win' button!new characters now start with 800,000+ sp's compared to the <80,000 older players had - with my not-quite-maxed learning skills, that is equivalent to approx 2 weeks of trainingsoct skills now only have a pre-requisite of the relevant basic skill at lvl 4, as against the previous requirement of lvl 5 - saving over 30 days trainingimplants now cost < 25% of the price they were 3 years ago and with the new loyalty store, they are much easier to get hold of.assuming that you don't want to completely remove training time from the game, there is nothing wrong with the current system. not training learning skills does not stop anyone from playing the game, it merely means it will take longer to attain the necessary skills. investing some of your training time to the learning skills will reap rewards in the long-term.at the end of the day, eve-online has always been a game where effort = reward. removing learning skills would be similar to starting other rpg's at level 10 and in doing so, the players would miss an important part of the game. part of the magic of eve is that while you are training those learning skills, you are also learning how to play the game!"
"what are you, straight from special ed? clicking \"train skill\" doesn't take effort. unlike, you know, grinding levels in wow.now, you might argue that farming 22.5mil to buy learning skills is a fun activity that every new player must go through. it might be hard to understand for an industry-oriented player such as yourself (you are missing accel control 4 by the way), but not everybody enjoys running missions over and over."

"fyp.seriously, grow up. the goons have 2 members on the council and still ***** every day. it's ****ing pathetic, and so are you.also, all the critics need to stop using democracy as their reason. you clearly don't understand it, or you wouldn't attempt to overthrow the top democratically elected official while simultaneously claiming you're doing it for \"democracy\". jade was elected chair, and is the top vote-getter in the csm elections. in light of that, she wins every argument that uses democracy as the measurement. period. and, by definition, every attempt to remove her as chair or limit her ability to act either as a csm or chair is undemocratic.from reading the complaints against jade, what most of them seem to be getting at is that she is authoritarian (or against anarchism). that is not incompatible with democracy, as in most democratic systems the elected officials have all/most of the authority.edit - learn your governments, noobs!"
"my government has the ability to impeach presidents that were democratically elected because they are bad"
"then your government is a republic."
"assuming that mr. all caps is an american then you're right, but your statement does not logically follow from what he said. for example, in a westminster system, if the mps lose confidence in one person as prime minister and decide that they'd prefer another person to have the title, then that second one becomes pm. the person at the top gets kicked out, but it's hardly undemocratic - if anything, it's a better expression of democracy, since the voters changing their minds results in a change in the outcome. similarly, see any type of recall vote. using words like \"undemocratic\" is excessive - the worst that can be said is that people are looking to do something not allowed by what passes for the constitution. that statement at least has the virtue of accuracy."
"fixed."
"in a westminster system there is no direct popular vote regarding any position other than mp, so your point is muddled at best. the example of a presidency was better to use, as that position is voted on directly by the populace but can be ousted by something other than another popular vote. obviously, in that case the rule of law is greater than the popular vote. in your example it's rule of law on both sides and no direct elections have occured.recall votes can be democratic, but i should point out that they are unnecessary in a true democracy. in a true democracy there would simply be another election whenever the voters wanted.no, it's not excessive. jade was elected to the chair by popular vote. by definition, anything other than another popular vote that removes her is undemocratic. your argument that the westminster system allows for more democracy because it allows voters to change their minds only carries weight if the replacement mechanic/system is at least as democratic as the method used to place the person in office to begin with. the two are the same in the westminster system, it is undemocratic if the council removes a chair voted in by popular vote.and let's not stray too far from the point here: jade was elected to the chair by popular vote. the goons claim to want to remove her for \"democratic\" reasons. i am pointing out that there is only one truly democratic way to remove or replace a directly elected position."
"lets not make any mistakes here. this started when jade constantine threw out hardin from a meeting against the language in the csm founding document. he exerted powers that he did not have in order to gain an advantage over an in game enemy. this escalated when hardin brought a general motion to the council to formalize when alternates were to stand in for elected representatives. jade argued hard against this vote, and why wouldn't he, he had just, the previous meeting, excluded another representative with no grounds or authority. when jade lost that vote he editorialized it in a manner to make everyone else look bad. a member of the council named inanna zunni objected to this. later, in that same meeting, jade muted inanna for making points of order without explanation which many of the council members objected to and then during another vote badgered council members who had already voted into changing their vote before it ended.are goonswarm just \"defending their own\" in some partisan political play?unlikely, hardin is no friend to goonswarm, we are neutral. we have worked together in the past but typically fight each other. we have a mutual understanding that each will use each other for their own means until such a time as it becomes strategically expedient to do the opposite. we can work together on the council because we also have a mutual understanding that the council is not a place for those machinations. there is nothing to gain for gs or to take away from our enemies when the game is made more fun everyone benefits. whether or not that is for the 10,000 people playing factional warfare, the 20,000 people in 0.0 or the 40 people who want to destroy stations. there is only the goal to make the game that we all play better.inanna zunni is a member of electus matari, an enemy of cva for their entire time within the game. allies to ursha kahn during the war where cva took their space and sent them back to empire and in general not good friends.in terms of relevancy to us, jade constantine is farther off the radar that groups like repo who are so far off the radar that half of the goons probably don't even know who they are despite war decs going on for the past year or so. most what we have had to talk about internally is explaining who jade was to the majority of goons.we have no reason to support either of these people, nor to move against jade. it gains us nothing.it is only if the council is to be subverted from its goal of making the game better that we would have any reason to be up in arms. because we have a stake in having fun."
"keep digging. jade went emo on coad a few times and it seems people forgot about that. mr ego doesn't like to be contradicted. it was self destructive back then and it is now."
"i couldn't keep up with it after page 7, but jade averaged over 100 words per post, and has about 20 posts during that time frame. it's the internet equivalent of terry pratchett's 5 exclamation points."
"agree"
"i support this based on the transcript of the meeting, and jade's unprofessional behavior in this thread and the meeting.i don't care if the person holding the chair roleplays a drop bear, they should be able to separate the position from their roleplay and leave tourists alone for the duration of the meeting. if not, they're failing the playerbase and don't deserve the position."

"i'm not aware of anyone (other than yourself) claiming that there is a conspiracy going on in the council.looks like another strawman argument.your consistent and focused attacks on council members proves that you can't work together in the council.according to darius, he only represents goonswarm interests on the council. you guys had better get your stories straight."

"hmm, can't find the post so i'll retract it for now."
"i dont think youll find one. you may find one of others saying he does but ive followed the csm posts and have never seen darius say he was only out for goonswarm interests. if he did id call for his removal and i think he knows full well it would go over like a lead balloon."
"if jade is willing to mute a csm rep, then how long till he tries to mute the people?"
"that has already happened. they're representatives that don't actually represent us. the issues of greatest concern to the players are not the ones being put forth for discussion."
"this seems to sum up the speed issue nicely."
"certainly."
"issue is same classes not being able to hit eachother. and hacs coupled with speed and huge double extender buffer tanks. also going over 8 km/s or faster, which sometimes out speed the dedicated tacklers like interceptors, even if the ceptor is faster the approach and orbit around the hac will be too slow to survive."
"i think mila/dianeces has made it pretty clear that he's not here to logically respond to threads. he has yet to answer my challenge (claiming i've hurt his feelings as an excuse), has yet to respond to your very valid points, and seems to only be interested in bouncing between his alts to make childish posts or to avoid presenting an actual argument (as his above posts clearly exemplify).i think it's fair to say that he's not here to 'discuss'. however, i think newcomers to this thread can see through his antics (since there's not much else to see)."
"ah well its first item on the agenda for tomorrow. fingers crossed we get it through."
"fantastic. thanks for the help, jade. please keep us posted on how it goes today."
"i really hope they fix this.nighthawk is very underpowered compared to the other field command ships."
"ah thanks jade. even if the devs turn round and say \"hehe, no, the nighthawk's anaemic pg and useless precision bonus are specifically designed for its role as a slow but safe afk l4 mission-runner - it is not intended as a pvp ship\", then at least we'd know where we stand..."

"you would dare disrupt the game in this manner how dare you*mutes you*"
"i am cross-posting this since the 'ideas' forum seems to get zero traffic these days...while i am a mission runner by choice, i have definitely not run every mission there is so may have listed something below already in the game somewhere, but i have noticed a definite trend of:take item x to location y / bring item x from location y (mining and courier), or;go to location x, kill some rats, optionally loot something, bring it back.... and that seems to be it. just wondering about ways to make this a bit more varied. for example:mission quality needs to be better tied to agent quality, and with more missions be tied to increases in standing (would be nice to get this with factions as well as corporations - i'm over 8.0 with c-state now, my storylines should reflect the trust!).a rescue mission - to have a container which you have to put something into, like a battery for a 'dead' spaceship to enable it to limp home under its own power after exploding its experimental capacitor. maybe you only get a general location from the agent, who gives you a special high slot mod that lets you scan for that specific ship's 'signature' (and no other ships to stop people stealing the mod and using it for pvp purposes ;), therefore requiring you to actually find the thing first.stealth missions where you have to use a cloaked ship to covertly loot something delicate that would be destroyed by doing in with all guns blazing. perhaps could go loot the thing and then go in guns blazing in your mission runner ;) could also be required to 'drop' some kind of probe in an enemy base to provide intel - make surveillance agents actually gather some intelligence as well!exploration missions where you have to survey a remote area of a system (again requiring a special mod from the agent, perhaps be rewarded by a deadspace pocket to mine/kill in.large-scale courier missions that make me think it was worth the millions of isk and months of training to be able to buy & fly my freighter.better risk vs reward. level 3 guristas extra for instance - the 'hidden' 6th area has a bs in there and also a silo labelled as the leader's stash - yet it is always empty when destroyed and the bs rarely drops anything more interesting than a standard siege launcher. would be nice to get a random minor piece of guristas faction equipment in there. i just finished new frontiers for the first time and the whole story arc is talking about experimental technology, but at the end all you end up with is a stack of cash and a stack of lp - hello?r&d missions where you have to test a newly-developed module in action and report back... it performs well, but unreliably.pirates have hacked an acceleration gate aqnd set it so only small ships can get through. the mission-giving corp have tried to send their own small attack craft but they just get wasted. they need a highly skilled pilot... basically, a small hull mission - restrictions on the gate to force you to change out your uber cnr (or whatever you fly) and blow the dust off your t2 frigate. obviously the mission after the jump needs to be challenging for a higher skilled pilot than the type normally running level 1s...running the gauntlet - an urgent package needs to be delivered to a research station, but an unpredictable plasma storm has been blocking the approach vectors for weeks and shows no sign of stopping. our scientists have figured out a way through the storm that will *probably* be safe, but you'll need a fast, nimble ship to get through. mission requires a ship capable of going at (e.g.) 1 km/s and must navigate between however many markers it is in the mission space in a specific sequence. to be effective this would require some environmental damage, not sure eve mechanics can cope with that at the moment.... continued"
"from under their noses - a variation of the stealth mission noted in the first post - the target is a lootable container being guarded by a bruiser of a ship too difficult to take out by combat (super-powerful reppers or something). the key to the mission is to lock the ship down with a tackler, waltz in, grab the loot, and high-tail it out.edit - another survelliance/intelligence type mission - the agent wants you to fly to certain out of the way spots in a couple of systems (or maybe even all systems within a constellation for a better reward) and launch a surveillance probe at each location 'just to help them keep an eye on things'.more edit - mining mission, a ship carrying secret cargo crashed into an asteroid field at high speed. the cargo is embedded in one of the roids, you have to go mine the field and find what's left of it (mechanic here would be when the mining laser pops the roid, a lootable cargo can appears)more edit 2 - variation of the mining mission above, the agent has had a tip off that a certain asteroid field is very special - some of the ores look like fairly innocuous veldspar/scordite roids, but actually have a core compused of pure (insert random rare ore here). go mine it, and bring a share of the ore back to the agent (not all of it, gotta keep the reward thing going ;)i really would like to have variation of reward back as well. i miss the time where you were sometimes rewarded with goods rather than cash - i still have my little fleet of frigates in a hangar somewhere!and more on variation in reward - as well as the goods option, an option to take all lps or all cash instead of the split.my main thing here is to change the current state where a single ship / set up is the only thing required to successfully perform every mission out there. anyone have other ideas to vary the goals and mechanics of the missions at all to make them more varied?"

"this is a small and i'd think uncontroversial request.i'd ask to introduce a way to sort your inventory by meta level.i think we all know the pain, when you're cleaning up your inventory and have to decide what to keep for selling or using yourself and what to reprocess. this can take some time if your inventory fills up during extended time of missioning/ratting. it would make things a lot easier if we could sort our inventory by meta level, so one could just select all items of meta level 3 and lower and reprocess the trash.the easiest way would be to simply introduce a new column in the \"details\" mode of inventory management window, so one could sort it in ascending and descending order."
"i support my own motion, because it's awesome and you should too."

"large projectiles in general need to be looked at. scaling between the guns is poor and not consistent with other weapon types. there is simply no good explanation for this (for example why the jump from middle tier large acs to highest tier ac's should result in a smaller damage increase than going from middle tier large blasters to highest tier)."
"as people have said, it's not that minmatar weapons suck, they really don't. it's that the conditions for which they are designed are completely absent in battleship-scale fights. whether the solution to this involves changing the guns as the op suggested or changing one or more ships as goum suggest i'm leaving up to ccp, but i think this should be brought to them by the council."

"supportedwe want to be heard! xd"
"signed"
"pretty much yes on all accounts"
"you're pretty much wrong, i am glad that the csm ignores topics like \"monstertrucks\".as i understand it the csm acts like a filter between ccp and the playerbase. the 5% rule makes it so that it is possible to force an issue through the csm and to ccp. in other words, if monstertrucks gets 5%, it goes to ccp.nice stats though, and interesting read."
"being worked onwell, why haven't darius raised it to the council?is already sent off as a part of the agendaalready being worked on by ccp, as per the first chat log.already raisedthis is already raised as a part of the \"csm should vote for its own chairman\"this is the \"funky pos alterations\" issue. so you are contradicting yourself.ankh raised this.get one of your csm representatives to raise it. i don't know why it wasn't raised beyond time issues.we are requesting to talk the ia. this could very well be a part of it. but we have to make the request first.i don't know why this wasn't raisedthere is no such thing as a vote of no confidenec from what i understand from ccp. but this kinda goes hand in hand with the voteable chairman.at the time of our last meeting for the iceland agenda, the topic hadn't received 7 days discussion.this issue is being brought up tonight at our meeting. we hope ccp will adopt it to the iceland agenda.this was raisedthis means the csm works as intended. filter trough stupid ideas."
"but people would whine if we didn't raise it. it was raised as it was a concern at the time.yet a very very big issue as large parts of the community experiences itit was a topic which at the time had significant support compared to other topicsreaches out to a lot of people, had a good amount of support at the time. had support from csm member.was sponsered by csm member i believegenerally high support at the time.important issue, so that you guys can push forward issues onto csm for next term.high support at the timeanyways. you get the drift. i won't waste more time making the same point.at the time of their posting they all had very high support % or they had csm sponsorship."
"i'm bringing this one up in todays meeting."
"well, small point. but it's not entirely true that the 5% rule will force an issue trough csm. it merely means csm has to discuss the topic at their next meeting. the issue still have to receive support from the council."
"and this. we're there to read the issues and make sure the important ones that can be good for the game get onto the agenda. part of the job is filtering out high vote \"issues\" that don't do anything good for the game.-edit (and yep. 5% means we have to discuss it on the csm - it still needs to pass a csm vote to be raised to ccp discussion in the conference.)"
"raw number of votes isn't necessarily the only important statistic for gauging support for an issue. what about average votes per day (since some topics have been around longer than others), the vote-to-reply ratio, the sympathetic-to-unsympathetic reply ratio, etc. some topics disappeared into the background when a csm rep announced that they would sponsor them, so it's very unscientific to say that some of those wouldn't have had a great deal more support if no csm rep had weighed in on them when they did. the reps preempted what they thought were worthwhile topics.csm is not obligated to put every topic on their agenda; if that were the case then we wouldn't need a csm at all. they're doing what they're supposed to be doing; i have no complaints about their choice of topics.if certain topics continue to build popularity, then yes, ultimately csm will probably take them on. it's a long time between now and iceland, though, so relax."

"its item 4 on the agenda today. i'm bringing it up."
"whoops! wow, time flies. i suppose that's for the better, though; the first csm was always going to have much more to talk to ccp about than any subsequent csm - gotta get through several years of backlog."
"while i do agree that our votes are often ignored, in this particular case the most significant issue concerning time cards, is being worked on. therefore it looks like our concerns are being heard, at least to an extent.also, you gotta admit that it is silly to compare a 603 vote tc thread to a titans<-->monster trucks 84 vote thread. 603 votes is at least enough to get noticed, 84 votes, is just \"a few\" people. off course they will get ignored. i see nothing wrong with that.ps: i want to thank lavista for working on mid sized freighters, and rigged ships and cargo. this might not be a \"top vote\" to some, but it is a very significant issue that can improve the game in many ways and allow newbie traders to get to the top within any reasonable time frame. the way it is now, for many traders, acquiring a freighter is just about as hard as acquiring one in real life...i've been playing for a while now, and i grind for hours on end, but i'm no closer to having a freighter now, than i was when i started. i understand that this ship is something that is not supposed to be accessible to newbs, but he way it is now, is the rich will only get richer, and the poor can only dream of getting there... ever. there is no \"inbetween phase\".i'll give \"a half of a thumbs up\". the other half, is thumbs down."
"i think half the problem is seeing what is out there as a popular topic and have decent support. there is so many different ideas and issues flying around it is a daunting task at best to see everything or catch them all. also the current work load of the counsel should have some sort of limit due to the fact there are limits to how much each one can actually do. some issues are so complex that a rep may only take on one while some others might be more of straight forward proposal.the counsel has a finite amount of time to spend on a certain number of issues. so we have to understand that if you have 100 well supported issues the counsel has to be able to pick the top \"x %\" of that group for this time around. i think if we can somehow employ some tools that would make the issues/ideas by showing a more of clear proof of support i think that would help both the counsel and the player base.(aye votes: x )( naye votes: x) (base support: x%)from there the csm can quickly see what has some support and react appropriately. as far as \"monster truck\" posts. its not a hard stretch to see that was a troll post. it does not take that much use of the brain stem to actually identify the fact that it is not a subject to be brought up to ccp. if the csm can not tell the difference between a troll post and a real issue you are doing it wrong."
"someone please raise the minmatar capital issue, they're really terrible (especially the naglfar)."
"the csm is disfunctional to the point of being useless. they don't even know what they're supposed to be doing, and dont have the common sense to figure it out for themselves."

"if you make jita 0.0, the people who have their assets stuck there will complain because they can't use their stuff. the people who try to move their assets out and get ganked will complain because they lost their stuff.some of these people will quit eve. meaning less money for ccp.and then the high sec trade hub will move somewhere else. probably to a system that doesn't have its own dedicated server, meaning the new trade hub will have more lag than jita currently does until ccp gets round to changing it.tl:dr this is a bloody stupid idea."

"pointless argument really, you may not recall, but ccp on a couple of occasions had to reseed bpos in the lottery.because they dont last, chars go inactive, they get blown up being moved, accidentaly recycled, every day there are less and less.i own a couple of bpos and i invent, you make more isk with invention than bposi have a prowler bpo, which makes 11 a week, every week, thats all it ever will do.if the market tanks on prowlers...i'll still be making 11 a week whilst crying.with invention i can switch to another item and have bpc's ready in a day or 2.the bpo makes me 11 a week, with invention i can make 30 or more, yes they cost a little more to build, but the volume more than makes up for it.the days when a bpo made you instantly rich are long gone, most are next to useless, any item that has a high profit will attract the inventers and prices will drop to a reasonable level, classic example is hulks, bpo only = 500mil a pop, with invention 90-100mil a pop.bpo owners have no control on the market, they cannot react to market changes, they may make a higher % of profit per item, but isk profit will be way behind a half descent inventer due to his ability to change what he builds and the volume he can build.be interesting if ccp could release the number of t2 bpos lost each month and how many are on chars that havent logged in in 6 month or more.time and peoples stupidity will gradualy reduce the bpos to collectables soon enough, so it's not worth worrying about."
"so whats wrong with that, that also means i've been paying forever too play this game so i have every right in having 2 t2 ship bpo's"
"good evening, this is a fairly inconsequential issue in the greater scheme of things, but something that has annoyed me for a very long time.it's the lines that come out from all ships you have currently targeted.here is an example of what it looks like to have eight ships targeted at the same time:"
"the endless political diarrhoea that is swamping this page is beginning to get tiresome. it was always going to happen and in a sense it's a necessary part of the democratic process - just as how scams and ganks are a necessary part of our beloved sandbox. but it's getting in the way and beginning to smell.the council appears to be slowly progressing from talking almost entirely about nonsensical bureaucratic minutiae to actually spending time on the issues. that's great to see and i remain optimistic about the long term effect of the csm on the game. so when people come to the assembly hall it would be nice to see the real issues. i don't give half a toss about whether a councilman can be tied to space brothels, space terrorists or the ghsc. i care even less about whether you think a particular council member shouldn't be there - they are, now shut up. turn on your tv set and you'll see the same trash happening in real world politics the world over. can we at least keep it off the issues board? the jita park speakers corner board should be the place for rabble-rabbling about abuse of power or how darius and his wife did a \"terrorist fist bump\". the csm themselves showed in their fourth meeting that they can successfully talk about spaceships, it's time for us to follow suit."
"i agree that the \"you should resign!\" \"no, you should resign!\" stuff is just getting dull. that said, there are legitimate issues not relating to internet spaceships for the csm to discuss. the one on changing the 5% rule, the assorted complaints about the forum software, and that monster thread on the gtc changes are all legitimate topics for csm discussion. if you want to make a rule, say that only things which should be brought to ccp are to be discussed in the assembly hall, with csm-only topics(rules of order, ****ing matches of all varieties, etc.) going to jita park instead. i'd support that. but \"spaceships only\" is too restrictive."
"so you're basically saying that people who talk about stupid nonsense should close their bullethole?supported."
"yeah, but how many newbies are going to know about those? if you're building a fw alt, then sure, but this should be accessible to new players instead of just new characters."
"why not alter the required standing for signing up for a fw militia by the number of participants then? considering vast numerical disparities atm...and of course you can get the 0.5+ faction standing during a trial. of course you have to know how. of course it isn't done with just racing through 3 or 5 missions. but that is not really the intention either and i think it's okay. i see no reason for having five-day-old players joining a militia just to deliver easy kills."
"silencing people you don't agree with is communism. thats not communication."
"you should read up about communism, my friend. it describes a socioeconomic order that implies the public ownership of the means of production, facilitating the dispersion of the interest gained from those to the benefit of the whole population and not a single investor (at least in theory).it has nothing to do with communication even if the words may seem similar.of course there may be the slim chance that you are a remnant of the cold war era, so you equal communism with everything you else you might consider unfavorable. i don't know which would be more embarassing for you: if your statement originated from your profound lack of education or your mccarthyism."
"to be fair, silencing people who disagree with the ruling elites is a fairly fundamental aspect of communism as it's actually practiced in real life. i don't think there's ever been a communist regime that allowed for dissent - most of them would just shoot you out of hand(and a few of the more creative ones would then send your family a bill for the bullet), and the rest would just have you rotting in a jail cell for years or decades. marx's theorymongering aside, equating communism with repression is a fairly apt statement about how the world actually functions."
"silencing people was also the common practice durung the mccarthy era in the usa, the land of free. repression was also a trademark of many regimes that enjoyed the support of the western states in their fight against communism, e.g. the the military junta in chile during the pinochet years.so repression is something that happens independent of the underlying socioeconomic model of a society. equating repression with communism is really political oversimplification of the more primitive kind."
"hey, i hardly claimed that communism was the only repressive system humans have ever used for government. mind you, it's one of the worst - stalin and mao both killed far more people than ****** - but a cursory examination of history will tell you just how evil humanity can be, no matter what rhetoric is used to justify it. he was oversimplifying, i'll agree, but he wasn't doing so inaccurately.edit: wow, they censor the name of everybody's favourite **** dictator? this board must have had some real fun with godwin's law back in the day."
"no it's not, you're just trying to show off. communism is by nature oppressive because there is no other way to enforce its tenants effecively other than through force: communism without the dictatorship of the proleteriat is a 19th century pipe dream that can never exist.but anyway you just keep on copy pastin wikipedia passages in an attempt to look smart, it worked in high school so it should work here as well right!?also conflating stalin and mccarthy? seriously?"
"where did i compared stalin to mccarthy. i even never mentioned stalin.but perhaps you're conflating stalin with communism? in this case let me conflate the republican, federal, free market system, with slavery, racism and intolerance. i'm sure this would be fair, wouldn't it?just because some red necks told you that communism is the definition of institutionalized evil and can be used as general analogy for everything that is undesirable is doesn't have to be true."
"i should have known it would be useless to argue about freedome with an european."
"i'm quoting this, before you edit it out.oh, speaking of freedom: we here in europe have the freedom to travel to cuba. perhaps it's because our societies aren't so paranoid about communism, that they feel it necessary to forbid their own citizens traveling or conducting business there. just a thought."
"sorry, my education prohibits me to copy/paste from wiki. also i put in bold your obvious level of education in the spelling area. that is ironic and funny. don't worry though, the words do seem similar. oh, and good luck making communism work without a dictator."
"quality rebuttal right here.i'd advise to take some lessons on forum warrioring from your goon friends."
"sounds like a jade alt."
"i voted on the a.b.g. premiss .... anyone but goon ... so far i don't regret my vote"
"i take this as a compliment. though i'm not (another thing you could have learned from consulting goonswarm first), there are worse people that one could be accused to be the alt of."
"you really are bent on thinking that anyone who dislikes the chair or you are a goon/goon alt/goon friend? so sad. :("
"that's ironic considering you just have suspected me to be the alt of jade on your previous post are you really bent on thinking that anyone who dislikes goonswarm(*) and their sycophants is a jade alt. so sad *actually individual goons are not so bad really, it's just their aggregation that makes them unbearable."
"i voted for jade, and no i don't regret my vote.expect any csm chair to be a \"walking drama bomb\" - it comes with the position. you'll always have the people who love to pick apart every little action or word that the chair says and attempt to turn it against that person. and having other uncooperative members on the csm doesn't help much. jade just seems headstrong and willing to make his own decisions to me, which is something i would expect out of a chair (and out of star fraction, tbh). i can't see any reason people would want a uncontroversial and coincidentally indecisive person to chair the csm.so you don't agree with some of jade's actions, and maybe he is particularly flippant to his detractors - so what? that doesn't make him the antichrist, which is what i'd expect given some of the bull**** spread between this forum and the assembly hall."
"take the goon aspect out of this. i don't think it was ccp's intentions to allow any member to \"mute\" another member over a disagreement. when i read the logs i saw no reason the mutee should have been silenced over a debate in a democratic assembly. that was pure childish behavior on jade's part. to be honest i expecting that kind of behavior from the goons before i did anyone else. hate goons all you want but from reading the logs they seem to be doing a fine job. you know, they debate, they back up that debate with reasoning. they don't mute people that they don't agree with. that just childish, even for a goon."
"well, the debate will come to an end with the vote. that is what will decide if the council is for transparency or not."
"darius,csm emails should be kept confidential unless specified otherwise. if you need a reason outside of respecting your fellow csm's wishes, let me spell it out for you: your alliance trolls every csm issue and communication, from major to minor to minute. get it?"
"sorry jade i support you but what nonsense are you going on about? what does this have to do with powerplay? or votes? yes it might not be a good idea maybe even a bad idea in some people opinions. however it has nothing to do with powertrips. sorry you lose my support on this issue jade, i don't understand how you can reply to something daris posted with was clear and to the point with flamebait. stay to the facts don't start trying to make people hate someone or love you.also as for my stance on the subject.if it's a csm discussion it should be public, if it's an information chat or e-mail like meeting at 5, sure whatever. but if it's a meeting it should be public, and if not public, it should be public to the csm memebers at least."
"no, it's hardly discussions. so far the list has been used for publishing agenda items, submission templates, updates on agenda items like our internal calendar and things like that. oh, and mud throwing(hence why darius probably wants everything to be public, so it can cause more drama).i have nothing to hide on that mailing list. but i do want people to respect my privacy. i want to be able to communicate with my fellow council members without having goons running around twisting my emails and putting words in my mouth, which will happen.it's obvious why people want the mailing list public. but i will vote against this. if the community wants csm to run, we need communcation paths that can reach all council members, without threadnaughts spawning from every single email. if we don't have this ability, we will be unable to work effeciently. thus, i'm stronly against it."
"so the public doesn't get to see these agenda items and submission templates? why? what is wrong with them? you are fundamentally wrong in your characterization of goonswarm. we will put no words into your mouth. on the contrary we will quote you directly. had jade not been saying things like \"the only mistake i've made is allowing a little too much democracy\" then we wouldn't have had to keep quoting it.did goons threadnaught the second meeting? no, we did not? why did we not? because people behaved themselves and didn't run ridiculous power plays. just go look at the thread if you want proof. the only people posting in the thread is me, who has been disappointed in the lack of discussion that issues are getting due to inaction of the council and has been disappointed the entire time since the first agenda was laid out. and athiron who has taken issue with roughly the same thing except with the specific instance of the council allowing multiple issues be lumped into the same votes."
"the agenda items are here to see right on the forum. as for the submission templates, i see no reason why the public shouldn't see them."
"so then what is the problem with making the communication public? if you don't talk about things that shouldn't be public anyway then why not just make it public?its seems the only reason would be to allow yourself the opportunity to be petty and to enact power plays without the public being able to see just who is being dishonest with their vote and who is trying to screw all the others out of the votes that they cast."
"no votes are casted via email. all votes are done during meetings, which are public. so your assumptions, which are extremely wrong, are just plain wrong. the reason why i don't want them public? because i think it wont make a difference other than causing more drama. i do see why some wants that high degree of transperancy. but i think it's too easily abused as well.as i said, i have nothing to hide. i just think we should have at least some privacy. we could have to discuss things which are subject to nda.again, i wouldn't change my way nor usage of the mailing list, should it be public. it's that simple."
"i am sorry, i thought you saidit doesn't matter if we can see votes. i am not talking about votes(to get past your ridiculous strawman). the process is important and we have a right to view it. i want csm reps to be voting based on what they think and not power plays. when a rep goes on a power trip i want to know about. there is no reason for reps to be insulated the voting public. so lets go over what we would see if it was made publicagenda items:template documents:both of these are the public interest.anything else there that should not be cannot be construed as have a public interest to be private unless its specifically discussing items covered by the nda.the only reason to keep them secret is to allow people to exert influence over other reps for the purpose subverting the game towards a partisan agenda. so we have ample reason to make the records public because as you say, they ought to be. and we have ample reason to make them public to prevent any representative from any alliance from attempting to subvert the will of the people who rightly voted for their representatives."
"the first is already public. please check the very first post in this thread. the template documents i see absolutely no reason not to release. again, i see a lot of good reasons why it should be public. but i also think that there is reasons why it shouldn't. i thus go with that it shouldn't, because there needs to be some kind of privacy so that the csm can work without drama at every damn step we take. there was a reason the mailing list was created. what do you think will happen if the mailing list does go public? those who have things to hide use other means of communication. it's like disallowing drugs in real life. if things are disallowed they will be less obvious, more violent and much harder to investigate. i think the only thing that would make me accept a public mailing list, would be if it was delayed 1-2 weeks so that nothing can be taken out of context because things are work in progress, just like certain people tend to do"
"no the mailing list was created because there was no read only forum that the csm could post in but not anyone else.this is nothing like drugs. there is no trade going on. there are no fiscal interests. yea, people will communicate in other means. it happens. but that doesn't mean we cannot make all the communication we can as transparent as possible.public institutions rely on transparency to keep undue influences from corrupting the process. corruption of the process produces results that are not inline with the right and proper will that grants their authority.i.e. it makes it so the council will do less good for the game or more bad.how can that be a positive and why would anyone want to push for a situation that would increase the likelihood of that outcome.i am sorry, who is taking what out of context? are we taking jade barring a representative from a meeting out of context? are we taking jade editorializing a decision of the council out of context?"
"why are you saying \"we\"? do you feel aimed at? this has nothing to do with jade either.lets face it. the forum is filled with trolls and people who take things out of context for lulz and drama."
"we being the general forum population. there was no drama over the 2nd meeting when there was no clear problem. why do you think that people are going to make problems when they have demonstrated both that if there is is nothing to be alarmed about they will not make it an issue?"
"those \"people who take things out of context\" are the ones voting for the csm. they're voters and you're no better than them. they have a right to see what's going on even should it be misinterpreted. also, the mailing list has been used numerous times for official communications. you need only look at the emails to see that. you state that the council has some need for privacy in its communications and i will ask once again, to what end? what purpose does creating us as some separate class from the playerbase achieve? how does that fit in with what the csm is supposed to be?i don't see any responses to that. i see blind opposition and mischaracterization. i want drama? what the hell are you on about? if you conduct yourselves like reasonable human beings what drama is there to be had? i find it hilarious that i'm blamed for people's responses to the actions of others. i'm guilty for mentioning the crime as opposed to the person who committed it and now seeks to cover it up. puhleeze."
"so? they are still taking things out of context.did he claim he was better than them? is not having your email read by the entire game some sign that you think you are better than everyone else? if so, we're all guilty of it as i'm not aware of any email that is open to the public.they already see what's going on in both the meetings and here on the boards. and of course, they have csm's like yourself to warn them if some plot to take over eve is secretly being hatched in the csm email...good. if it were used more often for official business, maybe these boards would be more about player issues and less about goonswarm throwing a hissy fit.so that they can communicate with other csm's without having goons troll each and every communication, wasting council members time defending themselves against accusations that they are trying to unfairly influence council affairs by, for example, scheduling a vote on a thursday.you should tell us that. as far as i know, you're the only csm member to claim their constituency is not the playerbase as a whole (just goonswarm).what purpose does that achieve, darius?all the csm members were elected. it's not unreasonable for them to ask that they be able to carry out their work unmolested. players can still see what their council is doing, and ask direct questions to their council members.why would there be? you're the only person who believes that an internal email is going to subvert the whole process.you just accused the council of blind opposition and mischaracterization because they want an internal email system. that's being dramatic, dude.plenty. look anywhere on the eve boards.no one's blamed you for anything in this thread, and no one has called you guilty of anything. stop being a drama queen."
"why am i somehow not surprised an alt has again taken up the torch here? i apologize but there's no way i'm going to play the quote game here as i don't have 7 hours to respond to every sentence in your post. i'll respond overall though if it doesn't involve me repeating myself.you have a flair for the dramatic. quote me the part where i suggest people should have their email read by everyone? you're making it seem as if what i'm suggesting will force people to divulge their personal emails. that is not the case as i've said repeatedly. i am only concerned with the semi-official csm mailing list. private conversations are just that.why should i be responsible for raising issues? so i can be accused hilariously of \"trying to score political points\"? if people can see the mailing list of the csm then i won't have to. those who care can read it and those who don't can ignore it. uh-oh goon conspiracy quote detected. perhaps it would be wiser to say that if it were only used for official communications that people were proud of then nobody would have a problem with people reading them.you're comparing apples to oranges. they did schedule a meeting on a day the us members could not attend. what does that have to do with email?where did i claim my constituency is not the playerbase as a whole? i stated that i had the votes to be re-elected. as a matter of fact i've specifically stated the opposite multiple times.nobody's asking for them to be molested. i'm asking them to be transparent. there's a difference.again you refer to \"internal\" mail. there is no such thing. there is a mailing list and people's personal emails. i am also far from the only person supporting this issue. saying it's just me doesn't make it so.re: my responses... read the thread."
"more bs about alts. get over it.not going to bite on your strawman argument about email. no email is available to the public. you want csm email to be available to the public. it's unusual, and your arguments for it are tangential at best, while the cons of it are obvious to everyone but a member of goonswarm, apparently.you're a member of the csm. you raise the issues and make the arguments within the council, intead of asking that all council business be made available to the public so that your loud-mouthed alliance can trash it for you. if that's too much work for you, too bad.uh oh, goon blinders spotted. darius isn't aware his alliance craps all over every piece of council business. perhaps it would be wiser to say if feedback from goons was constructive or useful then nobody would have a problem with making more information public. (see what i did there?)the example of scheduling was used to point out that even mundane matters are crapped on and flamed by your alliance-mates. specifically they accused jade of being anti-american (or pro-euro, possibly), among other things, because the timing didn't favor the u.s. csm's.it'll take me some time to find it, but basically someone was taking you to task for csm business, and you used that as an excuse.don't need to ask for them to be molested, they already are. they are trying to get some work done despite this, and you are arguing for things that will enable and encourage the harassment while simultaneously not even acknowledging any harrassment exists. draw your own conclusions."
"there is a lot here that is just plain terrible qaed, so ill just get a few choice ones.no. the only candidate to do that has been jade constantine. for someone who is complaining about the level of drama, it seems you haven't read it.look especially in the agenda threads for the first two meetings. lord, the drama was thick, the forums were being threadnaughted! [/sarcasm]"
"instead of asking for the euros to stay up an extra hour or two he demanded that the u.s. representatives, whom he had already shown bias against leave work early in order to make the meeting.they aren't accusing jade of being anti-american, they are accusing her of using the meeting scheduling to skew the votes on the council.how in the world can you not understand that dissent can be justified? the judgment on the dissent is always hinged on the judgment of the cause of the dissent.if someone was making a stink because a someone said a bad word it would be one thing. this is entirely another."
"haven't read what? and feel free to link where jade said that.i think you should no longer be able to critique other's posts..."
"the euros were up past midnight already. he didn't demand anything regarding the u.s. csm's, he simply scheduled the meeting. he explained why the meeting had to be held on thursday, also (submission deadline). he also scheduled a second meeting for sunday so that all could attend.obvious drama queen is obvious?perhaps that's what they meant. that is not what they posted, however.dissent can be justified. do you feel like you have done this? do you feel like most of the things you have accused jade of can even be justified?i do not. you are irresponsible in your dissent. you are dissenting simply to dissent. your constant and unjustifed dissent is now just a distraction to everyone who reads this board, mostly because you throw baseless accusations into every thread and fail to follow up and prove them, or let them go when you cannot.scheduling meetings is mundane. your claim that there's some malfeasance going on regarding this has been proven baseless, but you persist in your accusation."
"also ccp told him not to <:]"
"if they can't take the joke they shouldn't have joined in the first place. we don't openly recruit, so unless you're some poor delusional soul that ponied up the :10bux: solely for the purpose of playing spaceships with us, they should know what to expect.it's not a corporation (or alliance) full of miscreants, no matter what you want to think. most of us are simply irreverent."
"looks interesting. unfortunately, my #1 problem with eve does not appear to be on that list (nanos). this leads me to the conclusion that either the csm believes they are fine and doesn't want to change them...or you folks haven't gotten to them yet. i'm hoping for the latter, though, knowing the mindset of today's playerbase, i doubt that's the case."
"if you think they're a problem, put up a thread on assembly hall. i don't think anyone has yet."
"o/ grismarhey, fix your site's databases already, mkay?that's all."
"this sentiment is silly. the csm is made up of other players just like you guys, and they're already giving up a lot of time as it is. i don't think its all that unreasonable to not expect them to be at the playerbase's beck and call 24/7 - this isn't their full time job. they aren't ccp engineers or designers - its a player committee.i mean, you can't seriously be making the claim that just because holding much longer meetings would cause problems for the us/eu part of the council that they aren't somehow honoring their obligation.the lack of thinking on the csm forums is astounding. this post will, of course, be interpreted next by someone as me saying that the csm candidates shouldn't have to attend meetings, or don't have to put in the hours, or whatever. everything isn't black and white folks.---on the issue of csm members looking out for their interests primarily - you didn't expect this? obviously these are not unbiased people, and as with any political position each member will have their pet issues and will tend to support those issues that affect them and theirs. again, this is not to say that the csm members should be allowed to be corrupt politicians who only look out for their best interests, but you must expect some amount of slant in their decisions based on their personal experiences and involvements in the game. that's why the playerbase was supposed to vote for these people - so that they could get a selection of members who represented their best interests.tl;dr - ideally the csm members will look out for the \"greater good of the greater playerbase,\" but you must account for some slant with their votes. it would be naive not to."

"after the damp nerv and the new bonuses to interceptors these ships are more the less useless today...plz give them there role on the battlefield back cuchulin"
"good points, but if everyone and everything was equal, what fun would this game be? every race has it's advantages and disadvantages. you don't want everything to be perfectly balanced out. it might be nice to make minmatar capitals \"somewhat\" more powerful, but they shouldn't be in any way equal to thanatos, or any other \"better\" ship. i agree that maybe easing the training requirements would be nice, but there should be no big changes to slots, cap, or whatever else.the major reason why you are upset really, is cause you're minmatar, and you want to have strong capitals. you don't care what happens in the process, you just want it done.by the same token, maybe i hate that the nighthawk doesn't really do much more damage than a drake. yes it has a hell of a tank, but i want more damage on it! it's a friggin' command ship after all! well, too bad for me... if i want a higher dps command ship i'll have to train for one from another race.minmatar might have sucky carriers, but they have ships that are the best in their class as opposed to other races. for example, i cant think of a ship that would compare to a vagabond or a rifter in their respecting class... (these might not be the best examples though. but i'm sure you get the idea)so in the end, my vote is yay, and nay at the same time. ;)"
"the problem with balancing around whole races is that you are not limited to the race you start with. when it comes to dreadnaughts, the only thing keeping you from switching races is weapon training and battleship training, which in the grand scheme of things is a pretty minor chunk of time considering the vast improvement you get flying non-minmatar capitals.its ok for races to have a certain flavor to them, and its ok that this flavor makes them better or worse in certain ship types. the problem is that since any player can fly any ship in the end game, you need each ship in a type (hac, dread, whatever) to have a use in some role. its ok if other dreads are in general superior as long as the naglfar is better in particular, relevant, situations. it currently has advantages in some very odd and rare situations and the performance increase in these situations simply does not make it worth it. the problem seems to really stem from the lack of a mid/low, the even spreading of mids/lows, and the dual weapons that make damage mods somewhat useless. i would say move a low to a mid and add a mid to make it a shield tanker, leaving the lows for damage mods (which it will be pretty inefficient with still, but since it can have a non-garbage shield tank, it sorta works out).imo the niddy is pretty decent now, since it can fit a thanatos's tank while having superior repping ability and the ability to fit both shield and armor transfers (cpu issues on shield transfers aside). its a niche role, but it doesn't give up that much for this and its a role that is relevant."
"supported."
"minmatar = eve in hard mode"
"as i've said before i dont really have a problem with them being the worst capitals, but more that they're the worst capitals by such a huge margin. if you have all the skills for a nidhoggur (min bs v, capital armor tanking etc) but do not have large projectile v (which is pretty worthless considering how much minmatar bs sucks at sniping) it's actually quicker for you to train amarr bs v and large lasers v and get into a revelation especially when you consider the training required for decent missile skills that most minmatar pilots probably dont have. not to mention you can now fly a pretty nice apoc or abbadon and are close to t2 large beams / pulses with decent gunnery skills shared with minmatar.the vagabond may be the king of hacs and the rifter the king of t1 frigates, but there's plenty of other good hacs (the zealot and the sacrilege are both very nice) that are almost as good as the vagabond but also have good battleships and the best capitals. any smart pilot would just train minmatar cruiser v, not bother with min bs at all, and just train for amarr capitals. getting the best of both worlds with relatively little extra training.basically, just because minmatar have the best cruisers doesn't mean they should have absolutely terrible capitals, supercapitals, and battleships."
"yes, make missile hardpoints go away, tia"
"best xyz sized ships doesn't mean that min caps should be laughably bad. i don't necessarily want min caps to be the best caps, just not as bad as they are. worst dps and worst tank dread is fine, but the currently the gap is so huge that you'd be better off cross training for another race. add on top of that the extra training needed for 2 weapon systems (dont forget supports skills) and you really don't have much incentive to not just suck it up and train another race for cap ships. 3 races of viable cap ships is pathetic."

"i support this. it should be noted that it is possible to transport rigged ships in a freighter if their unpackaged volume is 120,000 m3 or below with current game mechanics. just send it as a courier package. i would however like to be able to transport rigged ships with a volume higher than 120,000 m3 as well."

"not sure about the details but the time needs reducing. 24 hours is very awkward."
"fully supported. about the complexity level of the skill... imho it should be about as hard to train up as thermodynamics to give an orientation point."

"arties need some loving! no question"
"/signedeverything has already been said, artillery is just useless nowadays and 1400mm's are worst of all."
"when i think of artillery, i think of ordnance, something with a blast radius. why not incorporate that idea into the game? let me elaborate,while artillery has low tracking, compared to railguns and lasers, it could be compensated for by giving it a blast radius per-say. when its fired, if it hits the ship, then damage is inflicted normally, however, shots that would miss, or glance, could receive partial damage, so as to make artillery more like missiles. there could be an explosion velocity skill for projectile shells, and it could give the artillery the \"always-hit\" nature of missiles. generally when artillery hits the general vicinity, its going to do some sort of damage to its intended target, and i would like to see this incorporated. the game dynamics support this with missiles already, so there is no huge physics requirement to work out. i would accept a rof increase, to augment the nature of the weapons, but i think this could be a great addition, and really fulfill the role of artillery.edit: in order to justify something exploding without actually making any contact, the charges could be timed. in fact, they could make a new set of projectile ammo for artillery, so ac and artillery have their own. (would save them from explaining why the same ammo works in 2 different ways)"
"i fully agree. there isn't much reason to fit artillery on my cane or any other ship that i fly when i can get close to the same alpha with acs and infinitely better tracking/dps that way. i get 1500 alpha with 720 t2 artillery and 4 t2 gyros, 1200 alpha with 425 t2 acs and one t2 gyro on a hurricane with bc5.completely absurd if you ask me, easily out damaged by my stealth bomber with minimal missile skills."
"for people saying that since they are capless they should be a lot ****tier. remove capboosters then maybe that would be true. even then you'd be hard pressed to run out of cap in 90% of fleet fights.when people ask how to fit tempests in gf they are often met with \"fit a tempest? easy! train amarr.\""
"i agree that they do need sum lovin but if i remember right, wasnt the ammo clipsize of the arties reduced as a balance to th ezero cap use in rmr patch?am pretty sure there was sum balance done which has lead to the 1400 iis only holding bout 10 rounds.its really dreadfull cos when i used my mach with 1400 iis i'd get am npc bs's tank cracked only to run out of ammo and it'd sort itself out even ith arti spec lv4 and the extra gunery skills to lv5.admittedly the npc was draben kuvaki (or summat along them lines) but my over tanked \"under powered\" standard raven broke tank easily.if anything i would like to see the ammo capacity restored back to normal (double) or as op mentioned the damage increase by 25% to give that extra punch for what is the worst ammo clip in the eve universe."

"being a code-minded person myself and seeing the worst in a company workplace when it comes to delivering a product on time, i know firsthand that technology is fickle and may cause unforeseen delays. that's life, and there's no need to critique life.however, again being a code-minded person who knows what it takes to develop a technological product (whether internet-born, platform-born, or both), i also know that technology works on ones and zeros. in the end, it either works or it doesn't; but it doesn't work in shades of gray. there's only one place in the development process where there's a shade of gray, and that's meatspacethe human factor.in short, there can be reasons for delays. there can be reasons for misadvertised products. there can even be reasons for things to be cancelled after they've been announcedeven though none of this may be \"good,\" it's sometimes the nature of business in technology, even though it may betray a lack of forethought and planning. all these things, even with the lack of forethought, i can stomach, believe it or not. but as the op said, the major problem is not the technology: it's not keeping the community informed.whether ccp liked it or not, they committed to the mac and linux community for delivering their product when they announced it, made the client downloadable for mac and linux, and got the eve logo on apple's growing games homepage. even if it was a handoff job to transgaming, ccp's customers still look to ccp for product support and updates, especially if the product is half baked (which it was when it was released, and still is now to an extent, mostly due to the lack of premium graphics). they want to know how it's baking, even if ccp can't say when it'll be done, whether or not it's due to their development process or transgaming's.maybe our woes are the fault of transgaming saying they could port the client, but not realizing the full extent of the project they faced. maybe it was ccp being too willing to hand over their product while believing an outside job could do things to their standards. i'm just shooting in the darkbut honestly, i have no way to know otherwise. i'm fully willing to blame transgaming for the bugs in the client and the delays. i'm fully willing to wait a year for premium graphics if i have to. but i have no way of knowing.and in the end, that \"not knowing\" is not an issue of technology, or not being able to turns ones into zeros. that's the human factor not living up to its own declared standards, past promises, and apologies. it's a lack of devblogs and a lack of forum posts. it is not a \"kink\" in the development process. it is, strictly speaking, unprofessional. and it is unprofessional because it is unnecessary.agree with the op 100%. exclusive macbook pro user. tell us the status of your product, and our purchase."

"as i've mentioned on the mac forum, the only solution to get their attention is for people to stop paying. if you continue to pay there is no incentive for them to even bother acknowledging as is evident. as much as you like to play eve you either deal with being ignored, shut-up, or quit playing. i do not care to deal with companies who blatantly ignore their customers. there obviously has been some sort of request that nobody at ccp reply to this issue otherwise someone would have by now. people at ccp who have responded to these issues in the past like ccp whisper is absent even though he had stated in a previous post months ago that he was sorry for the lack of communication and would not let it happen again.the only way you are going to get the same performance on mac or linux is to have a native app. other companies have done it for their games, such as world of warcraft, but considering ccp appears to be a windows-only house this is not likely to happen. my gut feeling is is the reason why we have not heard about the premium support on mac is because it was determined that it is either technically not possible, or the hardware requirements are too high. the fps rate is already bad enough with \"classic\" graphics, what do you think \"premium\" graphics would do??? i can boot into vista via boot camp on my mac pro but as i've said earlier, i do not wish to support a company who ignores its customers.memkani, 10mil+ sp"
"the reason that eve can't be ported to mac/linux natively is because the underlying graphics engine uses directx. the engine would have to be completely rewritten in opengl, which i don't see happening any time in the near future. honestly, i don't really care about official support of eve for linux or mac. i don't use a mac, i don't see myself ever using a mac, and the people that do have to accept the fact that interoperability is a (serious) downside of owning a mac. i do use linux however, and i don't have any problems with playing eve through wine, and i don't see this ever changing."

"becuase the ban was ridiculously unjust. mulla said, \"hey, these guys are cheating!\" and ccp said, \"whatever. shutup. you're not allowed to play anymore.\" that's messed up, and it needs to be fixed.it did. it started a whole war that's been going on for two years now, where half the universe, the half that hates cheating, went to war against the other half, the cheating half, and those that suck up to them. it brought the corruption to light, and exposed the seedy underbelly of misconduct, causing ccp to make a lot of hollow promises about player oversight in the form of the player council. i'd call that some good.no. t20 started that, bob continued it, and then ccp did it to themselves.no he hadn't. nothing was done until the cheating was made public. t20's punishment came shortly thereafter, and the playerbase didn't start hearing about it until later, and when cries of harsher punishment came along, it was revealed that those with the real power of punishment at ccp had been on vacation, or whatever other excuse, and were not going to act against t20 again, since some form of punishment, whatever it was, had already been meted out in their absence.********** did no harm to the community. the whistleblower is not the one responsible for the initial cheating, he's not the one responsible for others profiting from the cheating, and he's not the one responsible for banning himself, and putting a black mark on ccp's name by banning a player who did nothing wrong, and, instead, some things very, very right.remorse for what? for being the hero in this story?said the bob member.no. we have the player oversight commitee for things like this. they were initially supposed to be for all kinds of cool things, and not just for idiots whining about moon materials or nanoships. it was supposed to be for us, as a community, to raise issues exactly like this, and so we're god damned well going, whether you like it or not.no good comes from jack booted fascist thuggery, and people completely ignoring wrongdoing either. stick your head in the sand all you want to. the rest of us actually give a **** about the game, and the environment it exists in. if we didn't, we would have all done the really right thing when this all came to light, and just stopped giving our money to an organization that reacts like this to whistleblowing, instead of making out feelings known by going to war, and *****ing on the forums."

"doesn't that simply mean they are valuable enough to afford those defenses?i personally think the pockets being mined out or a pos array that prevents your moon from being scanned would be awesome additions. moving targets promote more pvp. agree with this so much. it isn't that omber should be worth more than veld by virtue of it being low sec. it is that low sec being less developed should have richer roids (of every kind) left in it."
"right, and probably l4 missions aren't supposed to be better paying than l3 missions, or mining arkonor isn't supposed to be worth more than mining veldspar either how can you even say that with a straight face ?"
"op is spot on about the moon mineral problem and this is an issue that needs to be fixed soonest.(and no i do not own any of the other 64 rarity moon type)"
"if you just mined pure isk, and veldspar was worth more than arkonor, then i'd agree with you - the risk/reward ratio in that ever so hypothetical case is way off. similarly, if l3s were worth more than l4s, it would presumably imply that they were worth more in terms of each individual payout(cash, lp, loot, salvage), and as such no set of prices would restore the proper ratio. again, that would be a major failing of the game, and something that needed fixing. the thing with minerals is that there's a market with variable prices, and the various regions tend to skew towards different minerals. so instead of \"l3s are easier and more valuable, let's abandon l4s\", it's \"there's an oversupply of nocxium and a shortage of zydrine, let's mine less jaspet and more bistot\". and given that i'm pretty sure miners provide the vast majority of the minerals used in game, when the miners move to accommodate the new demands, the prices will eventually adjust to a fair equilibrium, taking into account scarcity rents, risk premiums, skill investments, and all that other lovely stuff. it's because relative prices can fluctuate that the market will be kept in equilibrium - that's a feature, not a bug. of course, given that there are 15 ores across 7 minerals, there will always be more linkage than the purest models would indicate, and there's room for individual ores to get screwed, but i really don't care much about the omber rocks feeling lonely, as long as kernite and gneiss are there to pick up the slack in the isogen market. the most efficient source of each mineral will fall into a roughly fair cost vs benefit line, and the less efficient rocks are largely irrelevant, except for inefficient miners(aka, noobs) and the odd mission requirement. this is what i meant by how the ores aren't \"supposed to\" have different prices - they will, very naturally, because of their different characteristics, but one set of prices is not inherently superior to another. ultimately, there are no shortages in the mineral economy at the moment, and the risk vs reward ratio of 0.0 and highsec is in line with how it ought to be. lowsec gets boned, of course, and i'd favour a fix to lowsec ores to deal with that, but that's a far more minor issue than your \"critical\" complaint. lowsec excluded, however, the mineral market looks just fine to me, both from the point of view of the industrialists and the miners."
"quite easlily i'd imagine, you can't compare mission rewards to base price or ores, shall i explain.- missions are set peices, the only limit on missions is what?, well time available to do them, the mission you get is ramdom and you'll only take so many standing hits refusing ones you don't like. its hard coded that lvl 4 will be better than lvl 3's, it can't be changed by the player as it is the ccp parameters (reward/rats/drops/drop ratio/etc) are set server side, no human intervention. - ores on the other hand only have a real value set by the player, the only parameter is the insurance fraud cost of a ship and that does not set a price lvl on individual minerals or ores, we can ask what reward we like as it comes not from ccp's hard code but human beings that all operate differently at the individual level.- different ore prices are player driven not hard coded like mission drops, there placement reflects risk, but the price asked or given (reward) is from the market which is player set not hard coded, its variable without limits not ridgid like risk.ok do you understand now, you made a very simple and basic mistake, oh, the ore mission comparisson was a worthless straw man that only colours you badly and leaves you open to be ridiculed, you're pretty smart but your not thinking things through from every angle in adequate depth."
"no, no and no. the security status lost costs the player plenty enough. insurance is just that, insurance, no matter what role you play. warp to zero nerfed suicide ganking enough. we don't need cuddly protected mission runners in cold harsh space, they can save themselves by staying docked.why isn't there a thumbs down option? all i see is a fanboi box to check."

"i do agree that the pilgrim does need something, but i am not too fond of your ideas to be honest.i think that we, as a community, should first try to get the developers to actually acknowledge that they seriously screwed up the pilgrim, and to some extent, the curse and bhaalgorn.first, it was the nos nerf. this was intended to only nerf nos-domi's and nos-myrmidons.then, it was the drone bay, and tracking disruptor scripts.even in a live devblog, when i asked the question in the forums about the ewar and force recons, the developer even said, \"well, we didn't really look at how scripts would affect recons, but i mean, we look at everything\".seriously, what the bloody hell is that? shouldn't the first thing you should look at be how a nerf will affect the ship it is meant to go on? especially when the modules for that ship work as intended before the nerf? this development plan makes me sad.anyways, after we get public acknowledgement that yes, the pilgrim is broken, we must then ask the developers when we can expect to see changes. no, i am not hoping it is changed tomorrow, because if it was, it would be a half assed solution. will it be during the ambulation patch? after it? next year? approximately when can we see changes?there have been a number of recommended changes by the community, all of which have seemingly gone ignored by ccp (*hint *hint.. all we want is acknowledgment that you have read the thread + options inside of it.. you know what thread i am talking about).personally, the first thing i would change is the powergrid. it needs to be boosted, alot. it wasn't necessary when we where not forced to use a cap booster, but now we are...the second thing that needs to be looked at, is its role in the game. its role as a soloer, as a gang ship, and as a fleet ship. what is it expected to do in each role? how is it broken in each role? here is a small, very small list:- solo: does not have the range, as all other force recons do, to stay outside of the \"red\" (ie: web range) and does not have the cargo space to out-cap most opponents. its entire weapon system can be destroyed, quite easily.- gang: again, it operates well within web range. its weapon system can be destroyed quite easily. its slow and does not have the range to counter ranged opponents. - fleet: does not have the range to operate within fleet based warfare ranges. does not have the ability to go into a system and lay down cyno generators, due to its horrid tanking ability. if you deploy a cyno, you will be killed. this is a known fact to anyone that has used a cyno. why use an expensive force recon to do what a cheap ass frigate can do?of course, this is just a small list, and some, or many, of you may not agree with these, however, the issues are still there, and there are many more of them."

"formal petition: fix precision heavy missilesprefaceive been asked to bring this to the csm board several times now. given the unanswered state (despite strong support of) the original thread in game development forum, i turn now to the csm for an escalation of this issue. my goal is to not crosspost or spam, but i am no longer confident that keeping the original thread bumped would ever lead to a dev reply.i used electrofreak's resolved missile damage formula for the below figures; they mirror what is seen in game. for reference, his original thread is here.introduction:precision missiles are weapon systems that are designed to give the skilled missile user a weapon capable of dealing with fast or small targets that would normally exceed high power missiles ability to engage. they attempt to perform this task while giving up firepower, range, and ship velocity. in their current incarnation, precision lights are the only system capable of achieving this goal. precision heavy missiles are in every way worse to precision cruise missiles, and both precision heavy and precision cruise are inadequate to engage fast moving targets. while a buff to precision missiles on the whole would be nice (not to mention all t2 ammo), i believe that to be beyond the feasible range of short term implementation. in the case of t2 heavy missiles, we are dealing with a bug, and it is high time it is fixed.the cause of this bug dates back to the earliest days of t2 ammo. ccp caved to forum cries regarding their stats back in 2006, and crippled the missile into the worthless form it now is. errors, intentional or not, in good faith or not, should always be fixed. even if thesestats were justified two years ago, hp boosts, rigs, heat, and other game changes have occurred. their stats must be changed, must be fixed to allow this weapon to have any bearing in todays combat."
"raw stats:these are the base states of all t1 guided missiles and their t2 precision counterparts. the impact of skills + ship bonuses will be examined in the next section.light missiles:these are the only decent precision missiles. they do not carry reduced range or damage compared to their t1 base, have 71% better explosion velocity and 250% improved explosion radius. the explosion radius is completely wasted, however, given that 50m is already at your average frigate level, and 20m is smaller than a pod. -7.5% ship velocity is an extreme penalty; it effectively prevents any frigate class vessel from using these without murdering their own speed as well.light:velocity: 3750m/sflight time: 5.00sest. max range: 18750mexplosion velocity: 1750m/sexplosion radius: 50mdamage: 75precision light:velocity: 3750m/sflight time: 5.00sest. max range: 18750mexplosion velocity: 3000m/sexplosion radius: 20mdamage: 75drawback: -7.5% ship velocityheavy missiles:these are the worst of all precision missiles. they carry reduced range, reduced velocity (the only one to do so), reduced damage, and marginal gains in precision and explosion velocity. they are, for all intents and purposes, worthless. the -5% ship velocity is a deal breaker for any nano-hac that would wish to employ these. while a lower value than the light missiles, these ships carry the most launcher hardpoints of any missile class until the caldari navy raven (hawk: 4, caracal/cerberus: 5, cn caracal: 6, drake: 7, raven: 6, cn raven: 7), while still needing the speed advantage like frigates (notable exception: drake)heavy:velocity: 3750m/sflight time: 10.00sest. max range: 37500mexplosion velocity: 750m/sexplosion radius: 125mdamage: 150 precision heavy:velocity: 3250m/sflight time: 5.25sest. max range: 17062.5explosion velocity: 1000m/sexplosion radius: 75mdamage: 135drawback: -5% ship velocity cruise missiles::precision cruise missiles have better stats in every field than precision heavies, save only explosion radius (which is meaningless, but will be discussed in another section). they are left, ironically, with no target class to shoot at: nothing of the battleship or battlecruiser size moves at the speeds you would really need these. most ships will go much faster than your explosion velocity will ever hope to reach. the -4% ship velocity is the kindest to the ship class most immobile; no cruise raven is going to care about that penalty. these missiles suffer from all the reduced damage and range of heavies.cruise:velocity: 3750m/sflight time: 20,000sest. max range: 75,000mexplosion velocity: 500m/sexplosion radius: 300mdamage: 300precision cruise: velocity: 3750m/sflight time: 10.00sest. max range: 37500mexplosion velocity: 1000m/sexplosion radius: 200mdamage: 260drawback: -4% ship velocityoverview:the precision heavy is slower for no reason, has a meaningless 33% explosion velocity improvement (compared to the 100% improvement to explosion velocity of precision cruise over base), a heavy velocity penalty, and dramatically shorter range. precision cruise are in every way superior for shooting nano-hacs than a precision heavy. this is the equivalent of battleship long range turrets having superior tracking, range, and damage of cruiser class counterparts."
"impact of skillsafter level 5 skills (not unreasonable for target navigation prediction  rank 2), these explosion velocities are as follows:light: 2625m/sprecision light: 4500m/sheavy: 1125m/sprecision heavy: 1500m/scruise: 750m/sprecision cruise: 1500m/swhere are the explosion radiuses you ask? frankly, in the age of the mwd, these are irrelevant. the worst case scenario, a mwding interceptor, has a signature radius of around 160m^2. a t1 cruise missile with guided missile precision 4 has an explosion radius of 240m^2. your reduction from signature loss is a mere -33.33%. however, it is far worse than this. the missile damage formula picks the worst case variable: speed or radius. the interceptor will outrun your missiles explosion radius by several fold; you will see no lost damage to radius as your explosion velocity will reduce far more than -33.33%. in other words, in the vast, vast, vast majority of situations, you will never see explosion radius matter. if it does matter, your damage reduction is nothing compared to that target using speed anyways.what will those missiles hit for?this article will show what level v tnp missiles will hit a target an x velocity for in % damage transferred. 100% = no damage lost to velocity, 1% = 1% of listed missile damage was transferred (pre-resistances). light missiles: 4500m/s vs:5000m/s: 89.48393168%5500m/s: 64.11803884%6000m/s: 36.78794412% 6500m/s: 16.90133154%7000m/s: 6.217652402%7500m/s: 1.831563889%8000m/s: 0.432023947%interceptors rapidly enter the zone of minimal damage. a max skilled p-asm cerberus can take ~25 seconds to kill a 6kms interceptor, ~35 to kill a 6.3kms inty, ~50 to kill 6.5kms, and it gets even sillier from there on in. precession lights fired from asm iis are the only missile capable of hitting nano-hacs.heavy + cruise missiles: 1500m/s vs:2000m/s: 89.48393168%2500m/s: 64.11803884% 3000m/s: 36.78794412%3500m/s: 16.90133154% 4000m/s: 6.217652402%4500m/s: 1.831563889% 5000m/s: 0.432023947%the numbers here speak for themselves. nano-hacs are untouchable by missiles (even the awkward cerberus will have a free -36% to incoming damage); even if they do hit for 20%, they still have to go through t2 resistances and tens of thousands of ehp on top of any active tank / shield regen the ship will boast.precision cruise missiles are faster, longer reaching, more damaging, and just as precise as heavy precision missiles. in short, precision heavies are broken.how bad is the range loss?another area of contention in the precision heavy missile department is their reduction of range. while cruise missiles also lose out on range, heavy precisions are inordinately cut short due to a duel nerf of their velocity and their flight time. please refer to the above section for their base attributes; im specifically going to go into precision missile range here.precision missile theoretical range, level 5 range skills:precision light: 42,187.5m (5625m/s * 7.5s)precision heavy: 38,390.625m (4875m/s * 7.875s)precision cruise: 84,375.0m (5626m/s * 15s)precision heavy missiles are shorter ranged than the frigate weapon, while being slower as well."
"proposed solution: fix the typosi really cannot imagine that these figures are intentional. there is no reason for heavy precision missiles to be missing a base 500m/s to their velocity, nor should the be missing flight time, nor should their explosion velocity be the same as cruise missiles! fix: precision heavy raw stats:velocity: 3250m/s -> 3750m/sflight time: 5.25 -> 7.5explosion velocity: 1000m/s -> 2000m/sthis would give precision heavy missiles their rightful base velocity as every other guided missile (the broken fury excluded). this would also create a tiered stepping in explosion velocity:precision light: 3000m/sprecision heavy: 2000m/sprecision cruise: 1000m/sthe new damage % breakdown at level v skills:precision heavy  3000m/s (2000*1.5)3500m/s: 89.48393168%4000m/s: 64.11803884% 4500m/s: 36.78794412%5000m/s: 16.90133154% 5500m/s: 6.217652402%6000m/s: 1.831563889% 6500m/s: 0.432023947%these damage %s are sufficient to impart meaningful dps to most nano-hacs, while not being anywhere near fast enough to hit interceptors. they become  yes  a lower damage, lower ranged (still has half flight time), anti-fast cruiser weapon. the roll they are supposed to perform. in addition to the explosive velocity tier, there would be a proper tier for flight time as well. remember, all guided missiles (t2 precision and t1 base) have the same 3750m/s velocity base.precision light: 5sprecision heavy: 7.5sprecision cruise: 15sfor comparison, this would create the following maximum ranges on an unbonused cruiser at level v range skills:precision light: ~42.2kmprecision heavy: ~63.3kmprecision heavy: ~84.4kmthe boost to their flight time and velocity was necessary to bring them back into line with cruiser sized weaponry; as it stands, they had 4km less range than the light missiles. even boosting their velocity back to the proper velocity only exceeded precision light missile range by 2km. given the significant range boost of cruises, i believe this too to be in error; a proper increase in ranges at each level is in line with t1 missile increases (100% range per increase in size of missile on t1, compared to ~50% increase in range on proposed t2 precision per size).i humbly submit to the csm board that these proposed changes be escalated to ccp. the original thread in the game development forum has so far gone unanswered. i seek not to radically alter game balance, nerf nano ships, buff caldari, or usher in a new breed of solopwn. i simply ask that these glitched, broken, worthless weapons have the stats they clearly need and deserve. - malvortex"

"signed a million, million times. precision heavies are hilariously bad, and are effectively useless in pvp."
"i confess that i've never used precision missiles before, but i really appreciate the exhaustive numbercrunching you did to present concrete evidence. supported."
"if there is one issue that deserves to be fixed it is this one. very narrow very specific fixes are required - these should be implemented immediately to end the travesty of terrible heavy precision missiles :("
"i would be inclined to agree.i'd mention though, that this does have a significant impact on 'nanoships' - precision heavy missiles can hit, but just do minimal damage to a speed fitted cruiser. upping their explosion velocity would raise this bar somewhat. i don't feel this would be a bad thing, but it would represent an indirect 'nerfing' of your average polycarboned speed ship.as it stands now, the 250m/sec difference in explosion velocity, between precision heavy missiles, and faction heavy missiles, when combined with the significant difference in damage, range, skills and secondary effects, makes them not worth the cargo space."

"i'm torn. on the one hand, i want to raze geminate to the ground, and turn it into a nature reserve where rats can roam free, just as god intended it to be. and let's be frank, the region's not much good for anything else.on the other hand, this is an idiotic idea, and will only make it even harder for new groups to get into 0.0, because noone is going to expend much energy in saving the outposts in crap space. besides, investment decisions have been made on the assumption that these outposts won't be destructible. changing this is fundamentally unfair to the people who built them in the first place.moreso, there's still the risk of losing all your space, and access to the outposts in it - just look at what was once owned by -v- and lv, and the rest of the old southern coalition. they lost all of their space, without giving people the opportunity to play a game of damage.however, i support this idea being escalated to the meeting with ccp, just so jade can be shot down and informed how stupid this idea is in person by both csm reps who have some experience of life in 0.0 and cpp themselves, in a setting where {,s}he doesn't have the opportunity of the wall of text defense that we so love to navigate."

"as a part of this issue if ccp could help provide a system that allows better cleaning of standing slots. many times corporations/alliances merge/break up. as it stands it is very difficult to track such information. a person spends hours \"getting info\" on each corp when house cleaning. we're pulling a great deal of unnecessary information. when it comes to standings we need active members and if a corp is member within an alliance. other thoughts welcome."
"okay, i'm tired so i'll try to keep this short and to the point. i make no claims to eloquency or coherence due to exhaustion, but here goes:nano/speed setups are taking the fun out of the game for many of the players. simply put, they're overpowered; one should not be the next best thing to invulnerable against most conventional ships and setups. even assuming you can hit a nanoer in the first place, its speed will usually allow it to escape the moment it is taking fire. in certain circumstances speed setups can be destroyed, but these usually require significantly more skill, numbers, and\or effort than it does to fly nanos in the first place. in short, the risk vs. reward is fubar.in addition, nanos make many ships and setups obsolete, rendering them largely useless on the battlefield. for those who are specialized in said ships and prefer those playstyles, it makes the game largely unplayable. (here is where nanoers will chime in with the \"then adapt!\" mantra that is so widely touted, but understand that just because you enjoy flying nanos or the ships and setups and blobs that counter them doesn't mean that everyone else does. this is a game - if doing the things necessary to win isn't fun then people will simply quit and go play something else instead.)proponents of nanos will, no doubt, come in here and state that nanos are required because of capital hotdrops and blobs, and i will even agree to a small extent. capital hotdrops and blobs have become more prevalent, so people have taken to using a mechanic--nanos--that destroys the fun of sub-capital, non-blob pvp as a method to avoid dying to them. (while i personally believe something should be done about the prevalence of capital ships anywhere but highesc, that's a discussion for another thread.) whenever any suggestion is made to weaken nano setups, certain reactionaries will immediately state that pvp would be impossible without nano/speed setups. i maintain that the opposite is true - there would be more pvp with reduced effect of nano/speed setups. there are many people, myself included, who don't play much because they don't enjoy flying nanos, don't enjoy fighting nanos (i don't like flying a rapier, don't enjoy having to drag a gang around with me 23/7, and the ships i prefer to fly aren't good at countering nanos, bar the tempest). however, there would be more risk, back to the level that obtained in 2005 and 2006.in any case, i personally think speed tanking should still be viable, but slower. i'd like to see maximum speeds reduced to something more reasonable, perhaps in the range of 2.5-3km/s for hacs. doubtless some people would say that such a \"slow\" ship would be utterly destroyed today, but that's large because the ships that would be chasing would be faster too. nerf speed setups somewhat and it levels the playing field. speed setups, at least for certain ships, were perfectly viable before the nano buff, even with the \"slow\" 3km/s velocities they could achieve. as an example, the old 3km/s vagabond from before the nano buff was a perfectly balanced ship. it was fast, but not to the point that it couldn't be caught. it also couldn't perma-sustain its mwd, and its guns had to track their targets. all of these combined to make a very good vessel which was also the top-selling tech ii ship of its time--people would pay as much as 200 million isk for one!this change, may, however, require an adjustment to certain other ships to become viable, as the web range of the huginn and rapier is far enough to be a major problem. if the web range of these ships was reduced to 20km at the same time as speed tanking is reduced, then it should go a long way in helping keep things in line. edit: please note that i am not saying this is definitely necessary. rather, i'm saying it's something that should be taken into consideration when examining the overall balance."
"anyway, i need to get to bed. i really started to ramble there at the end, and i apologize. i may come back and clean this up and provide more supporting information tomorrow if i'm not too frazzled by the time i get off work.tl;drnanos are overpowered. they make other ships obsolete, encourage blobbing, and destroy the normal pvp their proponents say they encourage.reduce the max speeds achievable and you will bring them into balance, though this may require a rebalance to the minmatar recons and eas as well.edit: folks, if you support one of these threads, there's this leetle button you're supposed to click in between the text box and the area where you select your character to post with when replying..."
"please, for the love of all that is holy, nerf the crap out of speed setups. i had a webbed vagabond outrun my t2 valkyries.. wtf?"
"holy hell batman! the first nano whine thread in hereoh, and no"
"not in favour of a plain nerf, but some rebalancing might be in order, i think."
"if you nerf nano, you nerf minmatar into uselessness. end of story. next?"
"hell no.thumbs down."
"so in addition to nerfing the speed of my rapier, you want to nerf it's effectiveness with webs too? what a fantastic idea, i can't see anything wrong with it. if you think the huginn/rapier is overpowered, don't try to mask your whine as a nanoship whine."
"right..."
"shut upthumbs down"
"agreed. it should be damn near impossible to run an mwd non-stop. there's your fix for this one."
"no we dont need to push the game even further towards blobbing."
"flying some nano ships myself, i know that there are currently only two ships that i have realy to fear.... the minmatar recons. in my opinion nanos are imba because every player who has not trained minmatar recons will have problems to counter them......... my idea is to introduce a mod for the webber whitch increases webbing range significantly....while on the other side makes it impossible to fitt a decent tank or something in that direction ... this would lead to more the less balanced possibilities to counter nanos for all players while not nerving nanos at all...cuchulinps: thought about it a little bit.... and maybe this issue could be combined with the assault frig issue.... maybe they should get a role bonus on webbing range like interceptors have for scramming...."
"there's an area effect everything else...why not an area effect web?"
"there is no problem here....stop moaning that your insured raven with 20mil isk of fittings cannot kill my fragile 250mil uninsured vaga...."
"you're either a bad nano pilot or you don't fly nano. you're missing a couple on that list of yours."
"this topic does merit serious consideration. the issue itself is quite complex and impacts well beyond analysis of the ships used to 'nano' alone. the balance factors of the nano phenomenon are not correct at the moment. i am not sure how much support can be expected for the issue, but it has my general support."
"no support here. as you say wrayeth, i'm going to say exactly what you thought i'd say - imbalance in 0.0 warfare, defensive advantage of sovereignty tools, capital hotdrops, jump-bridge hotdrops - these are your culprits, since they've made nano the only technique that can work in that environment and you don't handle this problem by removing the ability for players to play the game, you handle it by rebalancing the problems with the environment itself and ensuring that defense-advantage is toned down to allow other techniques to have a chance again. i'd suggest (seriously) you take a look at faction warfare wrayeth, maybe even join up and give it a go. see the sorts of ships and techniques people are playing there and have some fun. if nothing else it'll help bring some balanced perspective back. but at the moment i'm completely opposed to any gameplay change inspired by the knock-on symptoms of the broken 0.0 sovereignty system.there is nothing wrong with the risk/reward balance of nano-ships. the issue is with the environment that ensures that nothing but nano ships can have a reasonable competitive chance. you used to be in morsus mihi wrayeth, tell me with a straight face that anything except a nano gang can pass through morsus space secured by anchored bubbles, jump-bridged capitals in cyno jammed systems, and the constant threat of the uberblob near instantly appearing through the twisted miracle of sovereignty architecture in response to any incursion around that space. i'm not knocking morsus mihi mind - they played the game, they built an epic defensive trap that is admirable in its sterile efficiency - but if the game allows the kind of uber defensive playstyle where you are dead unless you can burn out from gates at 4000mps + then you cannot point at nanos as the problem. they are simply a symptom of a specifically broken play environment and that is the thing that needs fixing."
"you may have a point there, jade, agreed. but what about the part of eve-o that is not 0.0? i know it is often conveniently forgotten that some people live there, too...moreover, if you argue that the \"nano-phenomenon\" is absolutely necessary due to some... mhm... \"broken 0.0 game mechanics\", that does not really make (assuming for the sake of the argument, the \"equally\" part may be way off) an equally broken/unbalanced game feature justifiable. i didn't read the op as calling for a massive swing with the nerfbat. but it is a frequently made observation that not only minmatar ships, which by their background are kinda entitled to it go \"the nano way\" these days. it's not any more that it is two or three ships only that are popular for \"nano setups\". thus if it is legitimate to address the issue of eve-o going into the direction of \"capitals online\", it is imho as legitimate to fear the same for \"nano online\". even if we might not be there yet, stating that it is required to counter some inherent 0.0 problems and that would be that is the wrong way imho."
"jade you are wrong. \"imbalance in 0.0 warfare, defensive advantage of sovereignty tools, capital hotdrops, jump-bridge hotdrops\". if we take all of those out of the equation the performance imbalance still exists. you are not arguing to the point raised. the issue here is nano being a performance imbalance, not cyno jammers and jump bridges."
"two thumbs down. nano ships are not immune to destruction. just bring the right tools to the table. if they're flying scissors, find a friend who flies a rock. a cry for a nerf is not a substitute for a friend with a curse, rapier or any of the other counters available to you."
"reducing the viability of other techniques can in no way reduce the viability of nanos. you are saying that nanos are too powerful because capitals are too powerful! that is ******ed.its especially apparent because \"nanos\" is not something relegated to small gangs. just look at bob, they don't fly frigates anymore because there is no frigate that does anything better than a hac or recon.you will never be able rebalance 0.0 space to make nanos less valuable than they are without directly nerfing the ships and increasing the number of counters. you could remove all capital ships, pos, sovereignty, etc etc etc from the game and it would just make nano-ships more powerful. the only thing keeping tactics other than nano-ships viable is sovereignty and infrastructure, and they are still a problem."
"ahh yes, the \"guys guys, nano ships are fine, just fly nano-ships as a counter!\" defense.do i have to spell out how dumb that is? as well, with most ships, we define \"a counter\" as something that will kill the target \"especially well\". but when defending nano-ships, \"a counter\" is always defined as \"the only thing that might have a chance of killing the target if the target is competent\"."
"nanos are super fragile already, at most they have 10k hp. they can't do all that much damage either. the best is probably the vaga which puts out 300 dps at around 15-20km. they're essentially equivalent to a very well tanked drake in dps and tanking ability, the difference being that it requires multiple bcs (and sometimes even bss) to take out a drake whereas it only requires one only good and properly fit anti-nano ship to take out a vagabond. see for example the garmonation videos on eve tube.no support here.edit: also, nano gangs are one of the few truly viable counters to blobs, which i think most people would agree, need to have something to fear."
"support. i can't stand nanogangs."
"not true. disco bs > frig blob, and so should bombs, once they fix those.."
"1. there are only a handful of nano ships that have 10k ehp. its pretty much the zealot. the rest have between 16 and 25.2. it takes a single bc to take out a drake. well at least any drake that is useful. more correctly, it takes a frigate to kill a drake.3. garmon fighting idiots does not make nano-ships balanced.4. nano ships are not counters to the blob. nano ships are the blob. just like all the fools that said titans were the solution to blobs. just like any other overpowered tactic it will become the blob."
"op described the problem with nano's well. i think at least partial solution could be putting all speed enhancing modules and rigs to same stacking category. for example, after rigging the ship with 2 polycarbs, you could only fit 1 more od/nano/istab to low's before the stacking penalty nullifies the bonuses gained. so mass/velocity/agility would all be on same category."
"not supported.nano ships are ridiculously expensive, and should have abilities to match their cost.i'm talking minimum 300m each. most people i know who fly them are broke, and you'd be surprised how often, and how easily they can be lost if the pilot isnt paying 100% attention all the time.nanoships are stronger than regular yes, but they cost twice as much, and require 10 times the skill and concentration to fly.that's not broken.viable counters to nanos:mixed fleets!hugin/rapier!ceptors!any fleet bigger than 20!amarr ships (great tracking)!ewar heavy fleets!seriously. we run from all of the above. nanos work well because there are too many groups running around with 15 slow ships, no decent webbers, and no tracking or all missiles. nano ships are simply strong against the type of group most noobs put together (as much armor and dps as possible, bring ur bs guys)"
"i said they are the only real problem ! ok novadays you can ad the hyena...... but these are the only ships that make me running imediatly if they appear on my scanner.... but back to topic. i don't say that the nanoships themselfs are broken. but my opinion is still that there are to less counters. the advantage and the protection of a nanoship its is speed. so a classical countership would be one which can kill the speed. all classical slow and well tanked ships can't do that (and thats absolutely ok!). at the end it is always the same....if a nanogang appears you have to jell for some minmatar recon pilots... these are good counterships, but you need these spezialised pilots that have invested the skilltime in these recons. on the other hand the most interceptors are of course realy good nanoships with high speed and if they work in groups of 4 or 5 they alone can kill a ****load of ships. so you can train the interceptors of almost every race to have a decent nanoship but you need to train the minmatar recon to have a well counter ship .... that is in my opinion what is broken here !cuchulin"
"ok you are right the best nanoships which outrun all the other \"low cost\" ceptors and whatever else can be incredibly expensive. but if we stay at the ceptors for example, then you can have a nice nanoship for .....lets say 40 - 50 mio isk..... it will not make 14 km/s but it will also do the job ! 4 or 5 of them can kill for example a bs out of a group of slower ships which costs much more....cuchulin"
"it's broken, boost something to counter or nerf it"
"fix the blob then fix nano, otherwise people are going to be even less likely to travel solo/small groups looking for pvp.as a minmatar recon pilot 20km webs and a nano nerf would make me cry, for matari recons it'd just about make them good only for refining down for the minerals ."
"yeah now that i look back most hacs at least have 16-25k ehp, assuming they fit large t2 shield extenders (which is not necessarily a good idea if you want to be hard to hit).sure you can kill a drake in a frig, but that would have to be one of the stupidest drake fittings ever if it can't even tank 100 dps. nano ships reasonably fit however are much more likely to die to frigs than any reasonably fit bc is. i've seen drakes tank battleships in pvp with ease. granted they're not doing much damage, but thats my point with nanos. they're mainly tank and unless you're very highly skilled there's little gank there without severely curtailing your speed.if there are enough idiots flying nano ships to make 4 long videos, why are so many people complaining? seriously, if you can fit a rupture to specifically solo kill nano's whats the issue? you're not going to stand much of a chance against a tanked bc with a gank fit like that, but if you exploit the weaknesses of nanos there's nothing to really worry about, nanos will simply run.the real problem is that in the age of eft people are so obsessed with dps that they forget tracking, and other concrete considerations like ewar, cap, and range. i've lost enough nano ships myself to know that they take a ton of skill to fly well and you must choose your targets or you die. the issue isn't an unbalance really, its just that people don't realize that you can't use the same tactics on a tanked bs that you would on a vagabond.i'll agree, some blobs are nanoed to oblivion (espeically fw ones), but a blob overly specialized like that is susceptible to the same problems as any other overly specialized gang."
"keep proving me right. i wasn't talking about the hyena."
"the frigate does not have to do dps to kill the drake. you do not understand how combat works in 0.0. dps on the winning side is rarely an issue, its keeping the other side from leaving which is.it is however, ******ed to not do so if you can.balance is not achieved by assuming idiocy on one side and competence on the other. you must assume both parties know what they are doing. otherwise when people who are competent come along, the imbalanced will be exploited. the \"nanos will simply run\" is exactly the problem.as an aside: how many times does he fail that we do not see? videos often skew perceptions of the players ability. kil2 for instance, who we see making a number of cool videos has only a 1.5:1 battleship kill/death ratio. is he good? probably, but he still dies a lot. we have three pretty awesome videos from him, and if they were any indication he would have a 10:1 k/d ratio or something equally ridiculous. yes, that is exactly it. you choose the targets. no one else does. there is no way to dictate an engagement against a nano-gang without superior numbers of nano-ships. if your nano-gang sticks around and dies, then that is you being foolish and not them being accomplished.not really, no. because nano-gangs do not need to specialize. they will bring ewar, cap warfare, long range webs, logistics, dps, the works. but you can't force them to engage. and that is the crux of the problem"
"maybe not i am the bad nano pilot here ... if you have the omgwtf counter nano tactic then tell us little noobs your wisdom and if you argue right i will shut up and will accept that everything is alright with the nano stuff.....cuchulin"
"posting with the wrong alt"
"while i agree with this in principle, we have to remember that this is a game, and that implies everything needed to maintain a perception of fairness (i'm not saying equality) on all sides.things that with ridiculous cost (in currency or time) should obviously provide benefit. but in a game, one can only provide so much benefit before the perception of fairness is lost. often, the best solution to this is to have less benefit per unit cost, as the cost increases. in other words, 100mil to 150mil gives less benefit than 50mil to 100mil. if pitching a 150mil against a 50mil results in an absolutely no contest match (c'mon, who wants to play a game where the game guarantees a predetermined outcome?), the fix is simple! just decrease the benefit gained for increments of higher cost vs increments of lower cost. things with ridiculous cost will still provide benefit. things with low cost will still have some semblence of chance.. thus we can satisfywithout removing all the fun and challenge from a game.so i'm saying: yes, spending to rig up your ship should be rewarded in a bit more advantage (inversely proportional to how much you've already spent), but that advantage must never reach a point where it is usually classified an exploit in most every other game (\"if i do this right, i am exceptionally effective in the majority of situations, and for all the rest as well if i just avoid those.\"). the problem with nanos is it fits right into both \"exceptionally effective in the majority of situations\", and easily being able to \"just avoid\" the rest by choice."
"\signed"
"id say no, there are already counters to nanos, take my raven its an anti-nano*** battleship. my cruise missiles speed is just over 9000km/s with a 30 second flight time, thats the equivalent to 250km+, they come near me and in a few salvos there dead, especially vagabonds, and running dont help them as my missiles are generally faster than they are and including most inties except the real good ones (though they are nightmares to kill).most gangs tend to have a few huginns/rapiers with them and the cost is huge, my nano vaga cost me a whopping 250m isk to fit minimum. the ship = 80-90mt2 nanos are a few million eachoverdrives 1.5 i thinkthe rigs are 50-60 each (polycarbons)guns tend to be around 2-3mfits in general ur speaking 10-15 million."
"i've mainly done low sec small gang war fare and fw recently, so i understand the basic idea of tackling something. i think we were talking about different things however since a frig does stand a reasonable chance of killing a nano ship, but not normally any conventional fit.valid point, and he does lose some ships in some of the videos, however its still a 15mil ship taking down 100+ mil nanoed hacs.ah, so i think i understand now. i still disagree however. i don't see why a gang or a ship lacking significantly in dps and tank should be forced to engage anything. the nano's one real advantage over others is the ability to run but it does pay significant costs for that. sure you can have ewar on a nano ship, but its going to cost you and it won't be sustainable.i don't fly in 0.0 so i could be way off, but if the main goal of being in 0.0 is capturing and holding territory you're much better off with a conventional fleet; as nanos for the most part are meant to harass and weaken, but don't have the staying power of a well balanced camp.in my experience in low sec though the real problem with nano ships is that people just haven't gotten over eft.perhaps a better anti-nano change would be to boost sniping/targeting so that 300km is no longer safe."
"yep.cerb pilot, hvy missiles betweem 9000 - 9700 mps. 218- 220 kms max range. most vaga pilots would be hard pressed to get the hell out of the way or those things. no tracking issues and hard as hell to speed tank. and there you go."
"a frigate does not have a reasonably chance of killing a nano-ship. the nano-ship zeros out transversal, pops the tackler, and warps away.conversely a frig does have a reasonable chance of killing a conventional ship. apply scram, orbit, hope reinforcements get there before you die.and? there needs to be benefit to increased isk expenditure, the benefit is simply too high. cruisers are too marginalized. furthermore, the cost difference is not relevant. you could spend more on that rupture than a standard t2 nano-ship and fit a fleet of them and you still won't be reaching the efficiency levels that nano-ships gain from readily available goods.they are not lacking in dps or ewar. 2 falcons, 2 vagabonds, 2 rapiers and you have 1000 dps to 25km and you will be out of any fight before anything large can even lock you. as gang sizes increase start adding zealots and your dps keeps going up.nano's don't have the staying power of a heavily battleship/cap oriented strategic gang no. but for gate camps? loads better. if anything big comes in, and you are not in nano-ships, you have a chance of dying. a nano-gang can disappear into space and then reform after the threat has passed.in terms of fleet effectiveness, nano-ships are no slouches either. they are hands down the best support ships in the game. the wealthiest alliances(in terms of personal wealth) will have fleet compositions that look like thiscaps/bs/recons/hacs/hics/cov-opsthey won't have interceptors they will tackle with hacs and hics. in low-sec there are three fundamental differences.1. no bubbles: speed is less important when you can warp to 0 on every gate. 2. gate guns: 150-300 dps to 150km with infinite tracking...3. stations: anyone can dock at theseand just to get the ad-homs out of the way. i fly nano-ships. i do this **** because its effective. i am the high skillpoint wealthy(not technically) pilot that is just the ones to abuse these types of mechanics and i do, all the damn time."

"no thanks. i usually prefer not to give the nubs who don't know better free information. the fact of the matter is you are missing pretty flagrant non-minmatar vessels that every nano-pilot should look to kill as soon as possible."
"people must get over the notion that spending lots of money = game balance. it does not. balances are maintained by limitations. in eve, isk is effectively limitless. the reason your vagabond is entitled to better than say, a rifter, is because it is more difficult to use (training) and at this point a lesser effect of scarcity. it has nothing to do with the isk you spend. for the same reasons, some modules are entitled to perform better than others. in fact they add drawbacks as additional balance factors on t2. higher fitting costs, or power usage per cycle, penalties to other areas more difficult to use and so on. that is how item and ship balance is (or should be) maintained. officer gear is not entitled to be more potent than other gear because it costs more, the balance factor of scarcity is used. now the problems come in when combinations of modules and ships infringe on other roles to the point that ships that would fill those roles become obsolete, or nearly so. this is where some attempt to justify performance with cost. considering we each have what amounts to a printing press to churn out money when we wish that argument must be rejected. couple that with the gaming factor that every ship should have a role that it excels at above others (more balance issues) and you should see the problem. ishtars moving at 9k are unbalanced not because they move fast but because they eliminate the need for other ship classes. there are many many other issues tied directly to these simple underlying concepts.ships become more powerful and durable as they grow larger. these ships also get slower and less agile. as they grow smaller they become more agile, faster, less durable and less powerful. we have a wide array of modules available that allow us to push the envelop in one direction or another. if a larger ship can, by any means, be more potent (or so equal as to make distinction nearly irrelevant) than a smaller in every comparable category then there is an imbalance. the same can be said of a smaller ship to a larger. there are others issues, such as risk and the withdraw ability i will not touch on right at the moment. let me close with this.ships and ship classes have their place. nano can exist in this spectrum and be perfectly acceptable. if throwing money, which is not balancing, at something allows it to overwhelm through performance classes larger or smaller than itself there is a problem and the balance has been lost. this is the current problem with nano and why it needs to be reviewed.*edit* and sorry for the wall. i tried to keep it simple."
"ok some comments to this listing:mixed fleets....not a point on its own.....just saying if you have rapiers you can counter ithugin/rapier.... yes of course this is the only good way to tackle them downceptors.... a possibility...but i would like to see a single ceptor to tackle down a sabre or vaga....in most cases the poor little one will just get blown up ...any fleet bigger than 20!... not a point at all imho .... depends on the shiptypes of the fleet .... and is also not realy a counter cause the nano pilots will just fly away from the enemys and stay save, there is no possibility to get them engaged if they don't make mistakes ... amarr ships (great tracking)!.... never had probs with that, but even if some nano pilot is flying so slow that he realy gets hit...he will not be tackled down by this and just warp out if he is taking to heavy damageewar heavy fleets.... this can be of course a pain in the ass for every enemy not just nanos.... but again its more like a self protection....ecms doesn't tackle nanos...i conclude: there are of course possibilitys to do some \"self protection\" .... in fact there are missing quite a few like large neuts on bs and whatsoever.... but at the end we have a situation where it is still almost impossible to get the nano ships tackled down. if they take damage they will just burn away and warp off.... and that is again the reason why i think this is broken.....if they are able to kill me then there should be an easier (of course not too easy....) way to kill them then to have a specialised minmatar pilot with me. cuchulinps: sorry for my constant posting on this, but altough i have fun on my own flying such ships, in the last time the big \"not to tackle\" nano blops are realy anoying...there is just not much fun in these engagements for the none nano pilot....pps: it is your choice to do so or not....but if you not want to argue then you shouldn't maybe post at all...."
"sorry chaps we failed. it was the first item on the agenda tried my best to argue for it but ultimately it failed 2 votes for (jade and hardin) 6 votes against. i personally still feel this is an important issue and i'll try to work on it again later on in the csm term."
"what happened to the www.eve-csm.com site? why are we being forced to go to a third-party forum for the chatlogs? also, i haven't read it yet, but congrats on your 4.5 hour meeting. you guys really know how to party."
"serenity had to sleep - we did work pretty damn hard you know. i could have left you waiting till tomorrow but i'm still full of coffee so decided to let you know now. you aren't \"forced\" to go anywhere btw. if you don't want to read the chatlog on the star fraction site you don't have to - by all means wait till the formal release of the chatlog elsewhere."
"sorry, that came across nastier than intended. i was commenting, as much as anything, on the fact that the chatlogs for the last meeting also aren't posted anywhere other than said third-party board. i'm also a bit annoyed at serenity about my updates re new threads not having been added to the sticky, but i've talked with him about it, and it's not actually a big deal. i get generally annoyed when people on a volunteer committee take on a huge swath or responsibility and then don't follow through, especially since it seems that there's always one who does that. if it's temporary, hey, life happens, but i asked because it looked like there's been a bit of a full-scale retreat going on as regards the document postings you guys started with. it's hardly the end of the world, but it's something i'd prefer not to see happen. also, i've read the log now, and it seems like this one was just a long meeting because of a lot of issues, not because of any new drama. i must say, i'm thankful - one week of a derailed csm is enough for me."
"fail nighthawk is used for pve way more commonly then other command ships, but it fails at any decent pvp setup so this would not work, and you probably(should..) know this.why was there not a list of setups made, and compared quickly via images or whatever. or a challenge for them to go pvp in this thing without a mwd or cap booster!!all the info you need is in this topic.yea but who cares! we don't fly it!has any of you csm who voted no actually been through this thread?"
"the issue documentation i raised had a lot of good information from this thread in it kaillani. it had comparisons of setups and powergrid and the proposed fixes. sad but i couldn't convince people this time. will try again later in the session."
"ah well thanks for trying jade."
"kailani, you'll also notice that a lot of the rejections were based on the principle that they didn't want the csm to get into the minutia of ship-balancing. that's an entirely reasonable viewpoint, and it's hardly a statement that they don't care about the nighthawk because they don't fly it. i can understand annoyance, but don't get too ad hominem just because they disagreed on this topic."
"i apologize, i let some rl issue influence that post.though on the subject of small concerns, the large autocannon issue was voted and passed, with it having less forum support. it was said the nighthawk has strongpoints, yes it does. passive tanking, while all med/low/rig slots except 2 bcu are dedicated to the passive tank. if thats what you call a 'strongpoint', its slow it cannot tackle it cannot escape, its only a sitting duck that tanks well and deals out 425 dps from t2 launchers with navy scourge, or less from other damage types. adding a 3rd extender(with pg increase, and face it- missions pose no threat to this ship thus more 'pve only passive tank' would add nothing to it) increases kin/therm/exp tanking only. after adding a 3rd extender you only have 2 slots for hardeners, leaving two logical choices for pvp- em/invuln or invuln/invuln. em/invuln has 620 'uniform' tank, with exp being weakest at 512 tanked. best is thermal at 853 tanked. invuln/invuln has 637 'uniform' tank, with em being weakest at 312 tanked. best is thermal at 1154 tanked. and note that the currently usable 2 extender/em/invuln/invuln is 643 tanked, weakest em at 515 tanked. best is thermal at 915 tanked. i'd say the previous setup are worse then what can be currently fielded. why you would passive in pvp? i don't know, possibly in baiting or fleet situations but this ship only has 88 km range on heavies which is not good for fleet war. precisions(same with all 'guided' missiles) are short ranged for some unknown reason as well, except for light missiles which are equivalent in range to t1. i think it would need a shield recharge nerf, if only for the fact it tanks insane amounts of kin/therm even though it has a huge em hole(with invuln/invuln). the tank isn't too much when patching up the em hole because you have to remove a invuln or better yet- an extender."
"there is a bright side to this, of course. because this is a democracy after all, -.-, we can choose to not vote for them should they run again.this said: the issue with buffing the grid for use in pvp is that it will make it an even better passive tank for pve because you'll be able to fit the shield extenders with less of an issue. i mean, you don't want to make the nh too op for pve usage."
":facepalm:the nighthawk is the defining lame duck of field command ships.:double facepalm. oh, cripes, this is a terrible idea. all it tells you is that this it's useful in pve. you could try the same thing with missiles vs. turrets and conclude that missiles needed to be nerfed into the ground because of all the raven mission-runners. it's logically insane and, frankly, i am staggered that a csm member would propose such a idea. seriously, all people need to do to realise there's a problem is to look at the ship bonuses (hello useless precision bonus) and then spend 5 minutes with eft trying to shoehorn a useful pvp fit on to it. it really is that simple. i appreciate this, but what about large autocannons then? ok, they're not ships, but the principle is hardly different..."
"great!!somethings are best left alone, now if you could remove yourself from the chair, it would make my day a real happy one"
"i just explained this, yes the kin/therm/exp tank will be better for pve passive setup. the better option for omni-tank is to remove the 3rd extender though.a simple shield recharge nerf would do.also this ship would do great with a 6/4 med/low layout instead. 5/5 is the same as sleipnir as generally caldari ships should have more med/less low slots then a minmatar shield tanker. it would actually nerf passive tanks since shield relays boost the tank more then anything, while helping the pvp setup though this is an entirely different problem."
"i know this has been shotdown, but signed.- buff pg- drop a low (perferably 2) for a med (pref two) (caldari should have opposite med/low slot layout of ammarr. see absolution layout)- change precision bonus to explosion velocity bonus (precision is amazingly worthless)*sigh* from reading the chatlogs, its like the s&m forum, personalized. caldari is relegated to a lolpve role, minmatar has a perpetual fanbase, drones always need loving, amarr is generally viewed neutrally... the cynic in me questions the point of the csm if the members will vote in the same proportion as the installed forum base to begin with."
"*head explodes in anger at the ignorance*the nighthawk is only popular in pve. it is not popular in pvp because it has insufficient pg to fulfill its gang antisupport role, and has a useless precision bonus. i repeat, i am aghast that members of the csm believe that the nighthawk is popular in pvp and that an inventory count of it, relative to the other field cs, would provide any useful information on its pg needs or pvp balance issues. like charles babbage, i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such comments."
"this.makes one wonder if the csm shouldn't start a topic themselves to relieve them from the duty of taking a closer look at specific ship types and their balancing. it's one thing to look at wider game mechanics and escalate issues there to ccp. it's a totally different thing to get deep into minutiae of game design like ship balancing... and one that will tie up a big amount of their resources if they have to cope with it."
"while i will concede that having the csm committee looking at specific issues with specific ships might lead to too much minutiae, i am frankly astounded at some of the ignorant and apathetic comments made by some of the csms in reference to the very brief discussion regarding this very, very old issue.this comment seems to me to be the absolute definition of apathy. serenity doesnt seem want to bother reading a thread where its been conclusively shown that a ship has problems. so, instead of wanting to address the issue she simply falls back on, well, other races have ships with issues, so lets just continue to let this ship have its problems also.seriously, i was floored when i saw this statement. having voted for serenity i feel like i've made a huge mistake in having done so. it seems like several of the csms cant be arsed to read a thread and do some homework in order to truly step up to the plate and fill the role that they were elected to occupy.more of the same. if leandro had taken the time to read more than a few posts of the thread he would have seen some very solid (and very basic math) that explains almost precisely how much grid the nighthawk needs in order to be on par with other field commands. however, instead of reading the thread he just makes some ambiguous comment about how it might need a fairly small boost, since the nighthawk has other strong points. what other strong points? are some of the csms really too lazy to do their homework and read threads? isnt a free trip to iceland and a sense of responsibility enough to get people to do their jobs?continued."
"again, im astonished. are those people voted into csm positions truly careless or thoughtless enough to think that ship usage/ownership/or production will provide evidence of a balanced ship?! its already be shown by ccp that caldari outnumber other players, and most carebears fly caldari for missions. those two facts there show that more people are going to be pushed down that path of training and usage regardless of ship effectiveness. even so, the nighthawk isnt a terrible ship for pve, however, this issue has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of pvp. its obvious serenity did not bother to read the thread, otherwise she would have known.all in all, im pretty freaking disappointed that the csms so briefly and superficially touched on an issue that some of us have spent so much time trying to address. ill simply hope that some of the csms that seem to care to brush up on issues will readdress this later, or that (miracle involved) ccp might actually fix the nighthawk after having been gimped for years.regardless, my thanks goes out to those csms willing to study some of these issues, and who will continue to work toward solving this and other important problems."
"this is symptomatic of the problem. upon hearing \"nighthawk\", it appears that leandro has simply assumed that we were talking about pve balance and fitting issues. i wouldn't blame him for the assumption - the nighthawk is currently too gimped to be useful in pvp - but i would blame him for not realising that this is a pvp balance issue.this entire thread has been discussed in terms of pvp balance, although the implications of suggested changes to pve balance have certainly not been disregarded. to see such a comment as leandro's is simply... baffling.i think an explanation of leandro's comments would be useful. specifically: confirmation that it is understood that this is a pvp balance issue, not a pve one, and an explanation of what he believes the nighthawk's \"other strong points\" are in pvp, with the appreciation that tanking is not a role.i repeat, i am aghast that members of the csm believe that the nighthawk is popular in pvp and that an inventory count of it, relative to the other field cs, would provide any useful information on its pg needs or pvp balance issues. like charles babbage, i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such comments."
"*shrug*. i can understand the 'don't want to get into balance' response from csm. that actually seems fairly reasonable actaully - there's a lot of 'issues' here that are 'this is balanced, this isn't' kind of things.to pick up one, shoot down another though, it somewhat disappointing. oh well. time to go buy a few more falcons.maybe though, this is something in and of itself that should be an issue? e.g. should we be 'wasting' csm time with ship and module balance issues?"

"/raises handsimple, effective and useful."
"most certainly yes."
"not crucial, but would definitely be nice to have and it's easy to implement."
"very helpful, great idea!"
"i would love that feature. the meta level should show in the list view version of windows (hangar, cargo etc)"
"awwww jea"
"i think a dev has said that it required a second db lookup to determine the meta level. similar to the issue with getting a bpo-bpc distinction. otherwise i melt most of the loot of my entire corp so no problems with that."
"flip this on it's head. what about if there were a new module created a highslot item ( so it reduces the firepower of the ship chosen) which reduces the cpu requirements of a scan probe launcher ( not recon launchers) there for you can fit a scan probe launcher on a ship already in game add this new gadget to enable you to fit the rest of your ship around it minus the 2 highslots required for the mod and the launcher. say a scan probe battery of sorts ???what ya think ?"
"yes"
"sorry, experimental alt thing...."
"even if it did not get the csm support (till now). i support this even though.it would not be just the technical aspects of such a class of ships, but also some kind of identificational or even roleplay aspects.playing the lone wolf/explorer style is attractive in some ways and it has to have a suitable ship."
"1. buy a marauder.2. fit a probe launcher3. profit??"
"."
"there are so many others too... a couple come to mind.whatever happened to jirai laitanen after he was podkilled? he's not been seen for years, and rumours of his death, or reanimation into a defective clone have never been followed up on? it's a massive issue for guristas loyalists to know whether fatal and the rabbit are still actually running the organisation, or whether only korako kosakami is now.also, what ever happened to achilie abraxas and lucash helmatt who were representitives to the guristas capsuleer loyalists from venal, and were working on attacking mito to gain a guristas foothold there?whatever happened to salvador sarpati, and the federation navy soltueur class titan he stole, and rampaged through empire in back to serpentis hq?there are a million more unanswered questions and loose ends that the arcs were just cut short for and never completed, some that have a major impact on faction supporters.i can say that i'm 100% behind this issue, and it needs sorting.of course, a complete lack of faith in the ability of the csm to actually do anything about it other than argue leaves me doubtful it ever will come to that."
"i'd go with changing the tempest first, though, with more agility, 25m3 more bandwidth (making it 100m3 bandwidth, or 4 ogres basically) and 125m3 - 150m3 dronebay.it'd give it somewhat more punch, more flexibility for droning, and make it a proper minmatar ship. atm, it handles bad."
"the advantages of minmatar dissapear when you get to bs size ships, and then all of a sudden the drawbacks of minmatar start to play havoc. minnie doesn't do great damage nor does it tank too well but they have versatility, utility speed and agility (neuts come to mind). speed and agility are lost on bs's (normally) so they either have to be able to dish it out, or suck it up. the large auto's simply lack oomph, combine that with the tempest's silly dronebay makes it a no go. i don't see a way to improve the ship from a fitting/tactics point of view and lets not even start about arties these days. if you look at for instance a hurricane with a similar setup you don't gain any real dps increase no matter what you try when switching to a tempest.the maelstrom won't win any p!ssing contests either unless you go for a fleet setup and even then it's not something to boast about. the only bs that works quite well is a phoon which, oddly enough, does great if you completely forget about putting on turrets.so, 2 out of 3 minnie bs aren't up to par and those are turret users, the other one doesn't even use turrets most of the time (or doesn't rely on them). so yeah, instead of looking at the ships themselves i think that stating that large auto's need a bit of love is probably the best way to look at it."
"everything has been pretty much said. i don't use battleships because of all the turret problems. rather use battlecruisers which are more fun and are more minmatar like than the big slow battleships. it's a shame that they aren't too great. i'm not interested in what they're going to be like once ccp changes them. i'm more interested in how are they going to be changed because the only way to do that would be changing the weapons. making the battleships more agile/fast would go against the whole idea of battleships being the slowest but the hardest hitting boats in the game. good luck ccp"
"i agree with this.from when choosing between missiles and projectiles on my typhoon (both the same ship-bonus), i seem to remember that:a)missiles do full damage over all ranges, while due to falloff projectiles do notb)missiles have no tracking issues, while projectiles doc)missiles also don't use capso i was surprised when i learned that projectiles didn't do any more damage at all... making missiles quite the superior choice. which to my oppinion makes a pretty good point for projectiles not living up to it. they should at least make a viable alternative, just with different strongpoints."
"/signed"
"i honestly don't think my maelstrom needs any more damage output, its kinda overpowered allready if you ask me. but if acs got a straight 7% damage increase accross the board and the maelstrom was changed to a damage instead of rof bonus, the dps would stay the same while the tempest would get a slight boost. plus my ammo bill from the maelstrom would go down a bit :pthe only problems i have with autos is the ammo. barrage is nice, but emp and hail could use some work. i would like to see emp get its base damage raised to be in-line with short-range charges and crystals. nerf the long-range projectile ammo if you need to, no one uses that stuff anyway. also, i don't see why hail should lose 50% falloff and optimal when void only loses 25% opt and 50% falloff, and conflag has same range and t1 mf. it would be nice if hail didn't have any optimal penalty so 800m iis could hit for full or near-full damage at the edge of web range."

"now, i know there are several other threads about this out there, and it's slightly against forum rules to make new threads regarding existing issues. however, in all the other threads about this, people are (in my opinion) getting things wrong. perhaps they don't provide detail to their ideas or perhaps they suggest things that would really not work in principle. bottom line: everyone (well, almost everyone) wants transferrable killrights. but so far, little thought has been given as to how this could be implemented. here's my idea:the system would call for a bounty system makeover. basically, make it so that bounties can only be placed by someone who has kill rights--and can only be placed on those he has kill rights against. this would prevent the system from being exploited (see below). a new kind of npc regulated contract can be accepted (by anyone) to kill anyone with a bounty. the thing is, the contract would require collateral equal to 5mil + 2x the target's current bounty (this would be to prevent anyone and everyone from taking out contracts on the \"big guys\"). the contract would last for one week of accumulated play time of the target; if the target isn't online, the timer is essentially stopped. if the target is killed by the hunter in this time, the contract ends, the collateral is returned, and the hunter gains the target's bounty. if the contract ends without a killing, then the collateral is lost and the hunter must take out a new contract on that person. unlike other stated ideas, though, the person who initially places a bounty (there could be several) does not have anything to do with the public contract. you should not be able to make money by being ganked. the contract exists because someone has a bounty on them; it is not created as a \"hit\" by the player who placed the bounty. as a side effect, failed contracts would cause an isk sink. when a contract is taken out on your head, you would recieve a mail saying who is hunting you (it could be multiple people) in the same way you receive a mail when war dec'd. as long as the contract is active, either party can legally shoot each other's ships/pods (the contract doesn't end when the hunter dies, just the target). also, the contract cannot be cancelled; once it is accepted, it's binding. anyway, this would make it so having a bounty is a win/lose situation; on the one hand, it could mean that you'll get free pvp; on the other, it could mean there could be the equivalent of a war against you--not your corp, you. if the target is podded during the contract by someone else, the contract ends and collateral is returned. one would still be able to pod someone for their bounty as they can now; the contract only gives the legal ability to kill the target for their bounty without repercussions from the law.also, the minimum bounty would have to be raised to at least a mil to make people actually want to hunt and to help prevent the exploitation of getting kill rights and then putting up a bounty of 5k to get someone to kill the person. with this system, the smallest amount of collateral would be 7mil for a 1mil reward; you'd get the money back if you did your job. remember: this wouldn't be exploitable against carebears. one could still only place a bounty if they have killrights against someone. the proposed system would give another (possible) consequence for piracy, but would still keep the law-abiding citizens safe. i feel this system would create a very interesting dynamic between pirates and bounty hunters. as a pirate, you'd feel all the more badass for having someone specifically hunting you; as a hunter, you'd feel all the more badass when your hours of work finally culminated in a successful kill. sorry for the text wall, but i figured i better state the details first as to avoid misunderstandings."
"what? no opinions?"
"this. raising a specific stat on a single ship (nighthawk needs more pg) was brought before the csm, yet a whole line of ships for one race being out whack was not. i'll add that the minmatar cap ships thread has had much more support than the nighthawk thread."
"i'd like to know the csm's comment on ccp's actions regarding the 30-90day etc. they were aware of the issue, and surely aware that it was being taken into consideration. if the issue was beyond the csm's level should we not all have been informed?allowing us to vote on an issue that has already been decided shows a very poor level of communication between ccp, the csm, and the community."

"[i think that the reason why so many people are frustrated in combat with nanoships, and the reason why people complain about them, is not necessarily that they are overpowered.the real problem is that only one race, the minmatar, can field ships with any real ability to counter them. the huginn, rapier and hyena have stasis web range bonuses that let you snare a nanoship long enough to bring its speed down in spite of inertia. the gallente, of course, have decent nanoships that might at least be able to keep up. the caldari have the crow and... uh... the crow. amarr? forget about it.i'm willing to bet that the vast majority of people who complain about nanoships are flying caldari and amarr, and possibly gallente to some degree. they can't fly huginns or rapiers without about a year of training for matari ships, it's frustrating, they feel helpless. their corp may not have many matari pilots who might be able to supplement their gangs to provide anti-nano capability.to counter this frustration while still allowing nanoship pilots to keep their beloved speed demons, i propose the either of the following:1) each race that doesn't already have one gets a hac or recon ship with a web range bonus, so we poor caldari pilots can one day eventually hope to get revenge against the nanogangs that blew us to pieces when we were noobs,or2) the introduction of a stasis field generator, with a relatively wide area of effect (say 30-40 km). similar to a warp disruption bubble, the stasis field slows down all ships within its area of effect. this will need to have a few limitations: firstly, warp disruption bubbles and stasis fields should not be able to be colocated -- you can't create a bubble that intersects with a stasis field and vice versa; secondly, the stasis field generator can be fitted only by interdictors, and you cannot fit both a stasis field and a bubbler at the same time. i think option 2 provides some interesting opportunity for tactical innovation on the part of the nanogangs. for instance, one could imagine pairing nanogangs with stealth bombers to couter the counter-nano ships: sb's warp in at 100+km and decloak, letting fly a salvo or three at the interdictor until it pops, at which point the nanogang can sweep in and do its usual business. at the same time it allows non-matari pilots to feel like they have some chance of killing these previously (for them) unkillable ships. and nanoships can still do what they like to do best: gank big slow ships that are caught alone or in small numbers without support.[tl;dr summary] nanoships aren't overpowered, the matari just have an unfair monopoly on anti-nano ships. we need to either give other races ships with web range bonuses or create a stasis field generator for interdictors to optionally use instead of warp disruption bubbles."
"the problem with nano's is with the mathematics involving inertia and how webs affect agility.see nyphur"
"hmm, your post seems pretty serious but the title says otherwise."
"i partially agree, but i don't think its entirely true that the minmatar have a monopoly.i actually can't think of a race that doesn't have a hac that could legitimately kill a nano ship except maybe the caldari, i really don't have any experience fighting a nano with missles.gallente: fit an ishtar with small drones and/or a drone speed mod.amarr: some quite capable nanoed hacs which good trackingcaldari: hamls with precision missles.in addition, the recons of each of those have some very decent nano counters:caldari: jamming (doesn't kill, but a nano that can't shoot you isn't going to attack you)gallente: sensor damping a nano to force them to be closer and thus orbit sloweramarr: curse, nuff said.webs aren't the only way to kill nanos, it just requires a little more creativity if you're not minmatar.edit: cleaned up a bit."
"grann, in my experience hamls don't have the range to take on nanoships, which tend to withdraw to cruise-missile-only ranges in between attack runs, so i'm not sure they're viable antinano weapons. the other problem is that most of the antinano countermeasures you mention there work fine for small nanogangs, but for large nanoblobs you run into the following problems:1) you can't jam or dampen every ship all the time, so they don't get discouraged;2) (re: ishtar, curse anti-nano operations) if you go out to meet them, they'll tear you apart, because if you're not already in a nanogang, you probably don't have an even number of nanoships, and they can draw you out of range of the rest of your fleet and call you primary. i was recently in an engagement between a 15-person nanoblob and a 15-person conventional t1/t2 blob that ended in a nearly perfect stalemate because neither party was able to engage the other -- if they got too close we'd web them, and if we went out to meet them they'd pick us off one by one. there was a lot of frustrating sitting around watching one another across 300km of space and waiting for the other party to blink. the nanoblob eventually left because they had to go to bed. i'd like to see something that can lead to a decisive victory for either party with good planning and tactics."
"caldari have ecm, giving them a caldari skinned rapier/huginn would destroy racial specialisation and balance. same argument goes for amarr and gallente with their respective recons.i like the principle of this idea, but not the practical application. a much easier solution to implement in my mind would be to increase decloak range to 30+km off a sg so that the incredibly frustrating situation where you get webs and tackle on a target and land possibly 2 volleys of whatever your weapon of choice is just to see them jump can be balanced more effectively."
"ah ok, i stand corrected.i think that this story really is a better indication of the balance than of something being wrong. if there were no nano ships at all a t1/t2 fleet versus a t1/t2 fleet in a similar stand off would probably end the same way, or with minimal survivors. the big difference being nano gangs (lacking in dps and tank) get to dictate range.how about, instead of more webbing (which nano gangs will avoid anyway), boost sniping so that killing at 300km or so is not impossible?"
"not a bad idea. the caldari rokh platform would be great for this, but it would also be nice to have a missile solution in place as well. missiles are probably the worst anti-nano weapon in the game. maybe missile speed and range bonuses would be the way to go."
"ok, i figured i would see how much support their was for an expansion of the domi hulltype. either a customs (as they are the ones using this around the universe known as eve) or rogue drones.either make a faction domi or a faction sin.the sin is a domi hulltype but made for ew and stealth. this would seem ideal for the customs version but not the rogue drone version.the customs should expand on the sin as ew and scanning, a focus on its intel gathering role. its use in customs to track down contraband would be the direction of this ship rather then its ability to create a jump bridge. not a group ship specifically but rather one made to be like a bloodhound in groups and a survallience craft alone in customs efforts to stomp out terrorism and the illegal traffic or drugs, slaves and anything along those line. bonuses to scan time, scan (exploration or ship probe) time bonus and strength bonus. no offensive increase but adding the use of the covert ops cloak a must.the rogue drone use of the domi hulltype would focus on its tank and drone deployment abilities. drone damage, tracking, armor and shield boost, drone control range, drone speed, drone optimal range, drone sig radius, mining drone productivity increase, support drone abilities increase and many other areas would seem to be its focus. the basic toughness of the rogue drones would be easily represented by adding another lowslot. this could be used for armor, resists, agility or many other things. the third and last differance would be armor repair rate. the advanced neural network aboard this ship not only allows for better control of remote entities outside the actual ship but the control of the nanites within the ship increases so as to allow a 3.5-5% increase of armor rep amount per level of the focus skill(s). though it might also be plausable for the hybrid weapons bonus to increase to 10-15% as all the drone varients of the domi hit real hard. but if this were to be the case i would go with lasers because the drones would seem to use beam types rather then ammo based systsm... but i could be wrong. though ammo would seem to be something they would have tried to avoid worrying about.the customs ship should require the normal black ops skills and signal aquisition, astrometric triangulation and pinponting to v.the rogue drone varient would require bs v, drones v, drone interfacing v, electronic engineering v.thank you for your time."
"i wasn't aware that any other faction ship required so many level v skills.also no bs has bonuses to mining from any source."
"you've already posted this thread. just because it got low support and has been dead for two weeks doesn't mean you need to re-post it."
"honestly it makes no sense for some of the faction ships we have that seem to require very little or no skill in the core systems that the ship is built upon yet they are so much more powerful then the original hull type.personallly i dont think any faction ship should be easy to fly but rather require specialized knowledge and study in the areas of their core systems to use to their full ability.it is this \"make is so everyone can use them\" mentality that makes them overpowered as the only control on their use is isk or lp points. not actual understand of the systems they are built around.yeah, i supported my own idea.ha!edit - and there are threads about replacing a particular ship graphic with a monster truck... so what?there are no rules for posting nor any guidlines observed for this forum by anyone.so, guess i will keep doing it till that problem has been remedied.thanks for caring."
"actually, there's a nice fat sticky at the top of the thread telling people to avoid posting duplicate topics, and providing a list of existing topics to help them do so. also, i've seen at least three csms tell people not to bump threads or to repost threads. also, look at this reasonably - your post got minimal support the first time around and died quickly. why do you think it'll do any better the second time around? you're just wasting everybody's time."
"appologies if this has been discussed and dropped of the face of the forum somewhere.the eve-o forums from general discussion to corps and alliances and jita park are going largely unmoderated. one assumes there is supposed to be some kind of moderation in place but we're not seeing it.i'd like the csm to represent the reinstatement of a volunteer based moderation team and a suitable accountability mechanic for those volunteers. in my opinion these moderatiors should be afforded fairly strict powers, enabling them to remove 'l2p noob' and 'go back to wow' replies entirely and temporarily mute repeat offenders. in a similar vein, i'd like for the csm to propose to ccp an ignore feature so those of us that choose to do so can self moderate posts shown to us. posts from a filtered individual would ideally appear simply as a notification that this character posted, with the opinion to show individual posts based on a contribution value judgement made on subsequent responses.example, i ban bobmcnasty for generally being a numpty, but then see:bobmcnasty: post notificationbobmcnice: \"actually bobmcnasty, thats a really cool idea\"i'd have the oportunity to display the post with indicated good idea and if sufficiently impressed, unfilter that player."
"(reposted in the first post)one last try for sanity...currently, the csm does not have any form of formal direction or sturcture. many people assume that the csm.pdf document is meant to provide this, but if you read closely, it is easy to tell that it is not meant for that purpose. it was written for ccp as a proposal for the idea of allowing/encouraging the formation of a player government. it is up to the csm, like any other founders, to establish how it as a government is supposed to work. if the people represented are not happy with what they, the representatives, propose, they revolt. clearly, the most popular csm related threads of late are ones calling for the downfall of the representatives, or ones mocking it.i can understand their desire to get things rolling and jump straight into issues. without a constitution or similar document that formalizes how they are supposed to do, and what they are supposed to do, anything that is attempted in the meantime will be a catastrophe of confusion. before they can address issues, the csm desperately needs to adopt a founding document such as this."
"an internet spaceship constitution lawl"
"it's no different than a local sports club having a founding document, or a school organization, etc. this organization covers a much much larger body of people than most of those would, and thus the need for such a thing is even greater.there are plenty of towns and cities with smaller populations than tranquility has, and they have charters etc. that establish city councils, mayors, police forces etc. it's foolish to think any organizaiton which is supposed to represent tens or hundreds of thousands of people wouldn't need a set of rules/bylaws. even the internet forums on which we communicate have such founding documents. i doubt you could find many forums without one."

"i'm a dad, and i live in australia. my prime playtime is between 8pm and 10pm weeknights. downtime takes up an hour of that, leaving me very little opportunity to play for anything more than 45 mins to an hour at a time. before people bring it up, i accept that it works the way it is, and whether or not it changes, i won't be going anywhere. i've learned to live with it as most aussies have. so please, no \"if you don't like it, go play xxx\" type posts. for all of that, i think it's worth throwing around some possible alternatives to the system. ideally, i'd like to see it put on a 25 hour timer, instead of the current 24. that would distribute the downtime equally for everyone. the big downside to this being of course that it would affect a much bigger proportion of the player base than it does now, so perhaps not likely.otherwise, if could move from week to week or month to month, through something as small as a four hour window. start it at 10 eve time one week, 11 eve time the next week, 12 eve time the next week etc. it would have minimal effect on the majority of the player base, still occur at reasonable times for the devs and, at least sometimes, give aussies the chance to play un-interrupted during the peak week night game time.and i know full well this idea doesn't have legs, given that portion of the player base and the council affected by this is relatively small, but i'm bringing it up anyway in the hopes that someone does take it onboard :)"

"they have it at 11-12 gmt because it is convenient for them. i won't support this, but i understand your frustration."
"i understand that ccp might want to have dt at a convenient time for them. however, i think that any time during normal working hours in iceland/london should be considered convenient enough. the op is only asking for it to vary within a span of as little as 4 hours.ccp needs to consider what is convenient for their paying customers...dt, as it is now, is not very convenient for our friends in oceania and east asia."
"i guess they had a good look at the demographic, then combined that with their own timetables and came up with what works best for them/the majority of players."
"yep, it sucks for aussies and kiwis but there are valid reasons for a set time and the period that it occurs in. you have forgotten to look at whats behind the game, the time was choosen to fit in with the icelandic uk working day for very good reasons:- gives time for a morning brief on what will occur at down time, all staff are available to elaborate on things to be carried out if required.- if something goes wrong lots of people are at hand and can stop everything and get on it.- the customer base can never be caught out as its always the same time and roughly the same duration.- no matter what time they did it people would be effected, but its best in life to upset the least number of people.- costs are kept down, no over time or out of hours payement, theefore better value for money for the company.there are probally a lot more reasons, but the first and more importantly the second are the ones that make it so."
"this has been brought up so many times in the past... even if you get it into a csm meeting and they bring it to ccps attention they probably won't do it anyways. and a shifting downtime would probably cause much frustration in the camp of the vast hordes of people who can't or refuse to read, causing much grief for ccp in return (daily 'omg teh serverz iz down!!!111oneone' threads guaranteed).i understand your frustration but am indifferent myself for as long as it doesn't shift into euro primetime regularly :p"
"i think that i would personally have the dt in an inconvenient time than have the ccp reboot stuff and do the dt maintenance and calculations outside of their normal working hours. if something goes wrong during dt, i would rather it was during the prime working time of the people who can do something about it. so if it is varied it should be varied only inside that constraint."
"with the current system of how election is done, you cannot directly challenge someone. you just need to finish the race in the 10th position or higher.i'm proposing the creation of csm seats. thus being able to challenge people whom have express horrible or great ideas.a rough idea of how the system would be is there will be 10 csm seats, where unlimited number of people can run for each seat. everyone(or account) will be able to vote once for each seat.i think this will improved the debates on issues. i hope such a system would also help remove alliance or corp politics and bring a focus on the issue.please start flaming now."
"block voting groups would be able to stack the entire council. that is probably a bad thing. with that vote manner the entire council would be likely to look like this:goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,alternates:goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,goonswarm,as funny as it would be to have a council of goons, the csm needs multiple view points from across the spectrum to ensure that the problems that are addressed are not only those which affect a single entity. in short, the representative system we have now ensures that minority positions can achieve relevance on the council."

"the problem:amarr ships being contracted will almost always have their most used ammo type, the crystal, either in their weapons or in their cargoholds. while other races' ammo does not suffer damage like the amarr, the crystal is special because it does not have charges, but rather gets damaged as it gets used. the current contract system disallows contracting of damaged items whatsoever, this includes the amarr ammo type.thusly, remote contracting an amarr vessel that has once been used for combat with turrets is not possible without repackaging it. and in some cases this can destroy rigs on the ship that are worth millions of isk if not billions.possible solutions:allow crystals to be placed in contracts with a \"(damaged)\" suffix. this would alleviate the issue with contracting ships, and allow all the ammo to be contracted aswell while not giving sellers a sneaky method of exploiting buyers of ammo.allow remote emptying of cargoholds and weapons. have it as a single feature maybe that would just remove all charges and items from the cargo of the ship in question.the former of these two proposals would allow all the ammo to still be contracted and the new owner would understand he would get damaged goods. the only issue i see with this is 'how damaged the goods are' would be impossible to interpret. but at least the buyer would know he wasn't getting brand new items when buying the contract.the latter provides a means to effectively complete the transfer, while the ammo would be left behind the ship could effectively change ownership without the original owner having to make his way out just to empty the cargohold. it would not jeopardize any market users and thus seems like the better choice.any other ideas would be welcomed and added."

"yes, this is eve online not \"my little pony online\". don't like hearing somebody's opinion? don't ask."
"more like, don't like hearing someone's opinion? just mute him from the channel."
"jade constantine, you were not voted into office as the chairman of a eve online entity. you were voted in as the chairman of a real life council of eve online players, voted in to present the concerns and wishes of the playerbase to the makers of the game.your behavior has during your term been completely inappropriate. the excuse of \"this is eve online lol i can do whateva i want\" does not apply. you are not being flown out to iceland to meet xhagen and the gang as jade constantine the eve player, you are voted in as andrew cruse, the person.your behavior has been on par with what i would expect of a 12 year old child, and frankly, you are a embarrassment. you have betrayed the trust of your voters, myself included, by acting in a self-serving, childlike, power abusing manner. your latest antics of assuming those who disagree with you are \"goon alts\" just serves as a glimpse into your bratty little mind.you are a disgrace, please do the csm a favor and resign."
"exactly what do you think this thread will accomplish?"
"it's a bit like asking harry s. truman what he thought about communists and then blaming him for it.obvious troll is obvious. please do us a favor and don't post anymore."
"the difference is, harry s. truman wasn't serving on a council with a bunch of communists, representing a public that included a whole bunch of communists. i am not trolling. jade constantine has in the past shown some very questionable behavior (gagging a rep for no apparent reason other than disagreeing with him, for instance). his behavior has on more than one occasion held up the council for hours.then, he openly states that he in fact despises the alliance that two of his fellow reps belong to, and by proxy themselves - does this not strike you as incredibly unprofessional? i am not trolling. i feel that this is a very valid point. do you honestly feel that jc's behavior on the council has been exemplary?"
"no. but i think it's unreasonable to blame him completely. it's been trial and error thus far. ccp's expectations have been lacking and the role of the chair was largely undefined.so i think it's wrong to blame jade. he was put under a lot of pressure."
"no, truman was head of political organization that was in struggle with a communist political organization. asking harry truman what he thought of communists and then blaming him for it would be kinda like asking darius johnson what he thought of bob sympathizers inside goonswarm and then blaming him for it, completely removed from his responsibilities on the csm.it is only a right analogy if you believe that the csm is a tool for alliances to gain in game power over other alliances. i, and i suspect many other people, find that idea abhorrent."
"truman didn't represent the communists and the americans."
"wait.it's unreasonable to blame jade constantine for jade constantine's actions? is that what you are saying?i'm not blaming jc for all of the csm's failings, i'm blaming him for his own personal failings in his work as the csm chairman."
"so what, ccp didn't explicity say not to be a crazy irrelevant douche, so man whatevs"
"jade being biased isn't exactly news. in one of the very first threads after the results were announced jade declared that he wouldn't be having anything to do with issues raised by people in goonswarm. someone find it before jade edits it to \"wall of denial\" or something."
"you're getting to be like jade, posting walls of text sometimes. you need to stay like this, short and sweet."
"so you are saying, if **** organisations win seats in a local german government (which happened), other politicians are not allowed to have biases against neo****s any more? the sense must be hiding somewhere.i'm not comparing goons to ****s, but jade's opinions are his own. whether they are appropriate or not is another question, and one that ranting on forums is not going to answer. if a majority of the council would have a problem with his opinions, they would find a way to deal with it. otherwise this is just the way things are and we will find out what the voters think about it on the next election.* the filtered word being a common abbreviation of \"nationalsozialisten\"."
"i see nothing wrong with this. jade isn't a robot.honestly someone else would just as ****ed if she said \"i love goons\" because she would be biased."
"noone is demanding that the chair be a emotionless robot, but there is such a thing as professionalism and tact.jade has let his own personal opinions precede his duties as chairman on more than one occasion - gagging a rep for disagreeing with him, wording proposals he disagrees with in as negative a manner as possible when announcing issues during csm meetings, and finally, discriminating against players simply based on what alliance they chose to join (stating that he absolutely will not answer questions or issues raised by a member of goonswarm), and has generally acted in a supremely arrogant manner.since someone so brilliantly compared goons to the government of germany from 1933 to 1945 (thanks word filter), thereby opening that oh-so-awesome can of worms, i'm going to go ahead and compare jade to a homophobe - he assumes that all goons (homosexuals) are somehow beneath him and not worthy of his attention, by virtue of simply being goons. jade also seems to be obsessed with some kind of \"goon agenda\", as evidenced by his assumption that those that criticize him are \"goon alts\", similar to many rabid homophobes in real life, who believe in some kind of \"gay agenda\"."
"i didn't know one is being born a goon, of course that changes everything! my condolences.joking aside, you'll have a point as soon as the first goon publicly takes on the opposite point of view. until then, i see nothing inappropriate about jade treating them as one entity."
"*yawn*where did you take the idea that jade has to be impartial, just because he has the chair. jade is first and foremost a csm member and a such entitled to to have a public political opinion. as he won the chairmanship by popular vote, he just acquired an additional administrative role, that doesn't void his right to express his opinion on things.goonswarm needs to realize that there are people out there, that don't like them. hardly news"
"it is not o.k. that the csm be used as a platform to exert a partisan ingame agenda.it is not o.k. that the chair use that position to exert power over other representatives."

"the incident during the csm meeting, taken on its own, is forgivable due to teething problems with the set up. (and a lack of a forum where these issues can be discussed by the csm during the week with each other) entertainingly, the most discussed issue so far seems to be jade's conduct during that meeting and his conduct after. his conduct after is not excusable. it was a tantrum, blaming everybody but himself for his words and his actions. are you honestly happy with a chair who will throw a strop when he doesn't get his way? is that why you joined the csm?"
"another epic meeting: 1. nighthawk needs a powergrid increase (jade)"
"what the hell why did you vote down capital shipsthat is like the only really important thing on the entire agenda"
"okay so i finished reading the chatlogs, that is incredible.jade and co. are so caught up in the bureaucracy of everything that they aren't willing to vote yes on \"talking to ccp about capitals\"ahahahahahaha that's incredible"
"i love that those who ran on supporting transparency are now voting to keep csm-wide communications away from the public. it really is pathetic and feeds into all the negative things being written about the csm. absolutely amazing."
"3.capital ships online bane"
"i do agree that it's an important topic.but the issue wasn't presented clear enough and the documentation wasn't available at the time, which was expected for all issues presented yesterday.so in order to get issues submitted the right way, i voted no. but please do notice that it was stated that it didn't mean that it would be a nice if it was raised for next csm -> ccp agenda."
"while the capital ship issue is a good issue and i actually agree a lot with bane on it, it was not very well presented and it was very unclear what was being voted for.from the chatlog it read like \"too much capital ships are bad, mkay?\". it's a bit too fuzzy to vote on this.it should have been separated in discrete motions that can be voted individually on like:a) reduce skill requirements for capital ships, esp. carriers and dreadnoughts. b) review the doomsday effect, esp. regarding the stacking issue of multiple dd on the same grid.c) ...d) ...etc.just voting on \"we should talk about the whole undefined complex with ccp. i will work some presentation out.\" would be a bit naive. i really don't know why bane hadn't something more concrete and precise prepared on this important issue. we all know that he's very well capable of doing this.another thing that applies to a lot of the csm members:when you ran for csm you made a commitment. you should all have been aware that it will cost you time and effort. that people can't be bothered to be on time and come prepared to such a meeting, or even review their documents for who voted on what i find a bit disappointing.if you don't want to put in the effort, because you're time constrained then you shouldn't really have run. it certainly isn't a problem if you miss a meeting now and then, but randomly dropping in and out, don't have your stuff ready when it's voting time, or unwillingness to document your issues properly makes some of you look rather amateurish."
"we were voting on whether or not to discuss an issue in iceland. that issue being capital ships. i think we got a bit tied up in the details of what bane's ideas were regarding the subject, which was an acid test i don't recall putting any other issues to. each of us will have opinions on each of the issues presented in iceland. we haven't had to examine all of them in order to decide they were worth discussing. v0v personally i think the council got a bit too tied up in the details and lost site of the actual motive. some of us don't even have a use for capitals to be honest so how you could be opposed to discussing something you don't understand is something i don't get. i've voted to discuss issues i didn't understand for the most part because i don't feel it's my place to deprive people of the conversation when i clearly don't have the knowledge required to say whether the subject's broken or not."
"ultimately i think that by not allowing any leeway on how well the i's were dotted and t's were crossed with the presentation of the cap ships issues, they simply diminish their own usefulness and importance.reading the log:inanna and lavista voted against because bane's write-up wasn't all in order,serenity voted against because he got caught up in the details of a specific sub-point bain made involving capital skill training time (serenity likes the timesink),ankh voted against because she just never has or will encountered a capship while tooling around high-sec in her miner or mission runner or whatever and so doesn't see any issue worth discussing,jade wrote that his problem was with the documentation, but he waited to the last (to see if he would be the difference-making vote) and probably just took an opportunity to vote against an issue raised by a goon.**** whatever was voted on here. however you guys can get them to talk about capships once you get to iceland, do it. it's not like they're going to hit your face if you try.e: i can just picture the devs focused on capships reading this like \"wtf, how did they miss this opportunity to talk to us?? what did we even make this council for? now we have to go back to sounding out our ideas with dev blogs.\""
"of all of the items on that list, the two i *didn't* expect to fail were the nighthawk grid issue and capital ships online. seriously.anyone who has ever tried to fit an active tank setup on the nighthawk while using hams knows that the nighthawk has serious issues. trying to cram a mwd, injector, and large booster on there in addition to 6 ham ii's requires two rcu ii's even at maxed fitting skills, ffs! i'm guessing the folks who voted against have either never flown the nighthawk or just don't use hams and thus don't care.as for capitals online, i own (and am skilled for) both a carrier and a dreadnought, and even i think something should be done about the damned things. they're crowding out normal pvp in all too many cases."
"well. the agenda for yesterday clearly stated that submission templates had to be in place before the meeting. i would have voted for the item if bane had sticked to the submission template he did submit. but he started talking about capital shield transfers and all kinds of stuff. it wasn't just about capital ships online being bad. there is a big difference between capital shield transfers taking too much pg and then the topic at hand.i would have supported it if bane split the issue up in pieces and had submitted templates for everything he started discussing, but that wasn't the case.i hope he will submit it for our ccp agenda in 2 months. it's an important issue, but i think he tried to do waaay too much."
"no. you would see that several people stated that they agreed with the issue in general, but bringing it up in iceland wasn't in order. they were all for bringing it up at the next agenda though.also that in general, csm, as i see it, doesn't like bringing up issues about specific ships. it's waaay too easy to blame us for being based, if we did."
"capital shield transfers/rars are an intimate part of capital balance, or lack there-of:psyduck:"
"i don't have access to the document bane submitted. but that wasn't the topic of the document from what i recall.the document never talked about cst's and rar's of any kind. when he started talking about those things, it was bound to fail because of the difference between the submission template and what he was on about.:psyduck:"
"see point 11. disincentivizing carrier spam (gangs of 20+ carriers), 2, revisit titan doomsdays, 3. incentivize the use of smaller quantities of carriers (1-6)"
"for the same reason we can't pay the beta that ccp is currently running of ambulation.if it's not done it should not be public.should book companies let the rough copies of major books be public? you need to be able to tie up a bundle of sticks before you throw them out or someone will take that lose unbundled pile of sticks and take what they what out of context.edit:note my point is we should not under any circumstances be allowed to beta ambulation even if they have it running right now. it would lead to mass whinage blah and balh not getting in and such. i don't think everythign should be public. just important thing. also how pointless would it be to read all the e-mails throwing the list back and forth editing it and making sure it's all sound and the link work and such. why would you want to read that if we get the final document. we voted these guys in if something evil happens i hope that the person i support will tell th community.edit: in other words csm e-mails should not become public unless someone raises a issue in which e-mail would need to be read. in this case nothing should be hidden. however, we, the public should not get to read them even then only ccp should or another group of officials and then what they find should be published for the public. once again same process."
"damn :/even though i'm sure the documentation on it was very very weak anyways it's still something i'd like to see changed i should of did more support on the issue since day one. then again the 1st person that ever brought this up was a dev during the alliance tournament interviews saying he hated learning skills in his game so maybe we won't have to worry about it :palso your not going up to iceland for another 2 months?"
"the csm is not a company, they have no financial interest in keeping its discussions public as authors and content creators do. they are a public institution accountable to the public.your analogy is thus false."
"when your analogy lets you down, find a new analogy!hmmm this time i'll state it using one word.goumindongthis is why they shouldn't be public as it would not be profitable to ccp to let goumindonghappen :)...you know what never minds lets let \"goumindong\" happen i've had a change of <3. 1st step? we implant chips in the csms brains to make sure we have there every word on record! i mean hell if they can't talk over e-mail they will jsut talk over the phone or in person right? right?or maybe... can't help myself... they will use msn! :pp.s.(your too easy to figure out, and i support some of your issues you nut)"
"when your analogy fails instead start strawmanning?"
"csm is a council that is supposed to represent us to ccp, i want to know how they are deciding to represent us fully before they go and do it.i am agreeing with goumindong i am agreeing with goumindong oh god"
"how come you have allowed many other worse presented ideas with badly thought out solutions go through with the intent of just loosely talking about the issue? the issue itself should be pretty clear to anyone that spends time in 0.0"
"to bad i don't trust people that have an agenda (note i'm talking about a lot of people that want to target jade) to take these e-mails that will nothing to do with csm and they will use them. i mean hell if i had something against him that's what i do"
"so, if there is a reason to not trust him, the information should stay private?"
"if jades emails will hurt him so badly he better think a bit more before sending them. this just confirms the impression i get of jade on the forums."
"i got the impression that the capital ships online topic just needed a one-line summary that encompassed the totality of what would be presented to ccp in writing. it sounded like it was the unknowns in bane's planned presentation that were throwing people off, and next time around if it's all written up ahead of time and summarized in a way where the reps are clear what they'd be supporting, it will be easily escalated."
"i will point to my original point.i got the submission template right in front of me. this document describes nothing about the things bane were talking about yesterday. i would have happy to vote it on if those details were in the document though.i don't know what the rules are about posting these documents. but if it's ok with the council, i would happily prove it to you by showing you the submission template that was submitted, which is the reason i voted no."
"well, what was his paragraph on it say? and what did the links say.aside: this wouldn't be a problem be if discussion list was public. oh **** now were taking things out of context because there isn't the context to back **** up. its almost as if that is more likely to happen when the list is private."
"or maybe it wouldn't have happened if all submission templates were public."
"the template is public, jade released it in the meeting for agenda subject. the submission isn't.i still fail to see how more context can ever be bad."
"lavista, there are basically two valid cases here you could have fallen under.1) you don't know anything about capital ships. in that case, i would at least expect you to know that bane himself is pretty much the living document of capital ship issues and potential solutions, and that you really ought to just trust that he's going to send something worth discussing to ccp.2) you're familiar with capital ships and have an intuitive grasp of the issues with them and how interrelated those issues all are, and so you would cut bane some slack because you have an intuitive grasp of the issues he was pointing at in the 5 minutes or whatever you gave him to write his explanation out in the meeting.but you chose:3) stand in the way of progress in the interest of covering your ass, because oh no what rogue ideas will bane send to ccp that you would actually have objected to if only you had known what crazy things he was going to write! surely that mad goon won't send anything within the realm of the hundreds of eve-o posts he's made on the topic. and what if ccp doesn't approve of how well the submission is organized! they might frown at you and scold you in iceland!basically, you're like the faa telling santa clause he can't deliver presents to the little kids because he didn't get the paperwork in for his pilot's license."
"why do you hate the little children, lavista? :("
"if we can't trust the csms to pay attention to issues other than their own, i guess we'll never see any progress. hell, hardly any of them post anyway, which doesn't do the public any good. darius and jade are the most prolific posters, but all they seem to do is argue. you'd think that with all the energy they spend arguing, they'd both be against the release of e-mails...but darius wasn't. jade even said before the meeting that if it did pass, he'd stop using the mailing list and use something else where he could keep his communications secret. what does jade have to hide? he'd even said he was in favor of a more open, transparent process, but i guess he was just assuming there would a goon conspiracy."
"no one right in his mind, will vote on a carte blanche, just to cut you some slack.yes, while bane is indeed one of the more respected goonswarm members and the capital issue appears less politically \"loaded\" now that the bob vs. coalition war is over, it doesn't relieve him of the duty to clarify and define what he puts up for vote.it's a bit amusing that goons like to paint themselves as champions of transparency in one case, but demand that the other csm members will blindly vote on their issues, relying only on good faith."
"[ 2008.06.15 21:24:19 ] ankhesentapemkah > sorry, i must also say no because i dont have insight in the documentation and because i do not think this issue is currently unbalancing.[ 2008.06.15 21:54:29 ] ankhesentapemkah > people do not even understand my issue[ 2008.06.15 21:54:45 ] ankhesentapemkah > no listen to what i have to sayhow ironic."
"it did however, relieve quite a few other members of that responsibility.but really, when the issue is dealt with isn't a huge deal though it would have been nice to have it done sooner rather than later.i think the csm is going to find that they have set themselves up with a lot of things to talk about and not enough time to get it done. they are going to go to ccp and not be properly versed in any of the subjects they have said they want to talk about."
"i assume then that the 30 & 90 day gtc issue will not be raised to ccp at iceland? i'm surprised it wasn't one of the discussed topics."
"allready happen"
"no it should go to ccp so they can chem him apart. and then be made public as ccp sees fit."
"thanks."
"the problem with the capitals online issue was that a) we didn't get to see the presentation notes and the documentation we did see was very brief and generalized. and b) (and this is an important one) - there were some very specific and contentious ideas expressed there that needed to be split up into different topics in order that we could vote on each element properly. an idea like \"reducing the skill reqs for capital use\" is a huge thing and its an entirely different issue to \"rebalancing the cpu reqs on capital shield xfer modules\". basically the issue was too big and all-encompassing while at the same time presenting some specific proposals that a majority of the csm did not support. i'll happily go on record and say right now that i do not find a good argument in the proposition that the \"capitals online\" problem can in any way be solved by reducing the skill reqs for capital pilots and allowing more alliances to spam capitals in fleet combat. it just didn't make any sense to me and i couldn't in all conscience vote for an issue that included this as a proposal. as i've already stated elsewhere in relation to my campaign docs and the issues i have supported, i believe the solution to \"capitals online\" is to increase the incidence of capital combat and loss through introducing greater necessity to expose these ships to formal combat risk and let natural attrition handle the problem.this could be done in various ways: changing the sov system to be less defensively orientated. aggression timers for station warfare, hell maybe introducing a timer to re-enter pos shields after you fire or activate a repper. i've already spoken on the titan issue and i'd like them to be forced to remain on the field longer after they dd. but basically i think the solution to \"capital spam\" is make the game harder for capitals and increase the risk they suffer on involvement in pvp contention. see more of them explode, we'll see less ridiculous over-spam. so thats my position on the issue, and i completely oppose the principle that you deal with a \"problem class\" or \"technique\" by lowering the barriers to entry for that class or technique. thats just counter-intuitive and in this specific case transcends game-balance into the realm of seeking partisan advantage for a hypothetical alliance for superior numbers of relatively low-skilled pilots and an aspiration to sit at the big boys capital table without doing the same training their rivals have already done to attain competency and military advantage in this field."
"the \"!\" and \"(end)\" things needs to be used properly. towards the end the meeting it went to crap with people being skipped, people interrupting and people repeating what they had already said over and over because some stated an opposing view. if you can't explain yourself properly or have a misleading title for an issue well thats your own dam fault, take some time on it and bring it up in a later meeting.also we only need support and deny as options for when taking votes not: aye, nay, support, not support, yes, no, yeah, no support, support escalation, ****ing nay, deny."
"we can say what we will about the documentation provided, to date voting to bring an issue to iceland has had very little to do with the individual's opinion. it was a recognition that the root issue warranted a discussion with ccp. this was something you'll find i even stated during the meeting, but which was glossed over in the interest of nitpicking about bane's individual discussion points.as i said... for a discussion issue each of us is perfectly capable of providing their own viewpoint. just because bane already has some ideas that doesn't mean that these ideas are the only things that will be considered by ccp in iceland. we're voting to have a dialog. not to approve the individual proposed solutions. the results of the vote yesterday indicate that 5 out of 9 of our csm reps do not want to have a dialog about capital ships with ccp. interestingly enough most of the dissenters live in empire if not all, where capital ships serve no purpose.voting to discuss an idea never had anything to do with agreeing with the details of an individual's specific proposal. i don't agree with some of the specifics in jade's proposal regarding destructible outposts for instance. i still voted to have the conversation in iceland because i feel it's a worthy conversation to have and who am i to say that simply because an idea only had 40 votes of approval we shouldn't talk about it?ultimately i don't believe the negative vote was an act of maliciousness, but attribute it to either a short-sighted myopia or a flat-out lack of concern because the issue doesn't impact the people involved. either way isn't positive. hopefully next time around people can look at the issue objectively or at least admit that they don't understand it and allow those who do to have their conversation."
"your thinly veiled jabs at bob just earned you a few points in my book."
"i hate to be the one to break this to you, but we're the big boys. getting cap ship pilots is not a problem for us."
"as someone who voted for serenity i have to admit that the above statment is pretty damn disappointing. the rather brief and casual glance that the nighthawk issue/thread was apparently given, and the total lack of understanding of the problem (and some of the amazing responses), have me genuinely concerned over some of the csm choices."
"as i said during the voting... i don't think it's our place to get caught up in the minutiae of buffing or not buffing individual shiptypes. i'd honestly prefer we concern ourselves with at least the barest oversight was was initially intended and high-level issues. if the nighthawk issue gains more support then i'd be happy to bring it, as is required."
"thanks for the response, darius.in some ways i agree with your take that the csm should try to refrain from getting too engaged with micromanaging nuances, versus tackling larger issues. however, as caldari ships go (i have four characters, one for each race) this is a fairly glaring issue.it's the only missile-based caldari command ship, and the problem is not a small one (which a moderately focused read of the thread(s) will show). the problem has existed as long as the ship (read years). i don't expect a huge quantity of support, as not many people bother flying it. however, if you look at the linked thread from the ideas and features forum, it is up to 17 pages if i recall, and months old.the numbers and math are there. it would take the devs all of 10 minutes of coding to fix the issue. when you compare the ship to the sleipnir (also a shield tanking field command) the nighthawk is truly a joke.trust me, i do realize and very much respect your take on wanting to avoid small balance changes to ships. however, this is an old issue, one for which there is plenty of firm evidence and math to back it up (not opinions or preferences), and one which it would take only a trivial bit of coding to fix.so, while it might seem to be a small ship balance issue, it's an old problem, and trivial to prove and to fix. investment in time versus reward on the problem is enormous."
"now that it's too late...it seems to me that a csm member with no idea or opinion on a subject when the vote comes up would be to abstain from that vote... thus a issue could be approved (or fail) with a 3/2 (4 abstain) vote...on the public nature of the csm, with luck, there will be another csm after this one, and another after that... making the vast majority of what the csm does public would help the later csm's skip over the problems this one faces having learned from it. granted, some of the communications need to held private as they may cross the nda line.lastly, darius, i think you are mistaken on the \"submitted\" information, while there will be \"discussions\" with ccp in iceland, they (ccp) is required to respond to the documented issues submitted, if the document is lacking focus, then the response will be of little value."
"the problem is, is that many issues have been passed onto ccp in the guise of \"having a discussion\"ed: i.e. the vote changed from \"do we want to talk about this with ccp\" to \"is this template of issues related to the brought issue something i personally want to see implemented\".surely no one would have said \"jade, i am sorry, i cannot vote to talk to ccp about destroying stations because your template document is not perfectly inline with what we are discussing in this chat and i don't support it\" and hey, we have that vote on record."
"the problem is, on the scope of things fairly small, and non-critical. its one ship in a line of missile using ships for a purpose that directly mimics what drakes do(and the drake is fantastic). now, it may be clearly lacking in powergrid(or hams using too much), but how easy an issue is to see doesn't necessarily mean that it should be escalated. i don't personally think it something that requires the council discussing it with ccp yet. and it looks like the majority of the council agreed. however, you can always ask jade to see if he can make the argument on the side regarding the issue. it just means you won't get an official response and jade probably can't tell you anything about how it went(nda). but it might get something done."
"i'm pretty sure ccp has banned abstentions. a stupid decision, imo, for exactly this reason, but it's hardly one i can overturn."
"i agree to a degree and will chat with jade about going forward to ccp with the problem (thanks for the advice regarding that, btw). however, how many years should a ship be totally out of whack and broken till ccp finds 10 minutes to fix the code on it? seriously, the lack of grid on the nighthawk takes grade-school math and a tiny portion of logic to understand (this is totally excluding its useless missile precision bonus).yes, there are other ships that need tweaks also. however, the nighthawk has been this broken since the day it was introduced, which is years ago. i do believe the longer-standing a problem is the more priority it should be given."
"ccp didn't ban anything. they made some suggestions which we could choose to or not to follow."
"get more than 40 people to support it in assembly hall. as it stands it has less support than destructible outposts which is downright sad."
"while i understand support for an issue does play a role, i'm not sure how much weight that should be given.if an issue can clearly be shown to exist with any aspect of the game (with actual evidence and proof of such an issue), why should the popularity of the issue hold priority over common sense?"
"everyone who has an issue be it a pet issue or not is themselves convinced that the evidence is clear. i personally don't fly nighthawks and know nothing about them. the bottom line is that if an issue is clearly a problem you should be able to get more than 40 people to support it. unfortunately it's as good a measurement as any that i'm personally going to get to go by because, as i said, i don't fly them though some goons have complained about it.who knows? if the issue's that clear then maybe the devs will see it on their own and we won't even have had to bring it to their attention?"
"please, even the most obvious of issues like corporate email logging which would reasonably have every single ceo in the game telling their corps to vote for it to force it being pushed to the csm have only received 500 votes.you voted to discuss destroying stations despite it having less than 40 votes at the time and having large opposition and effecting probably fewer people than the nighthawk problems did. don't pull that populist bs. either there was a good reason to not bring it to ccp or their wasn't.\"i don't know what is going on\" is not a good reason, though understandable since there is no easy mechanic by which the csm can be educated and informed on the topic(with proper dissent of course), but the excuse of ignorance does not make the reason any better."
"oh your so big."
"what on earth are you on about? nothing i said in that statement is incorrect and i've already stated why i voted to support destructible outposts. the fact of the matter is i didn't bring the issue. the issues i did bring i am willing to justify. the votes i've made, i am willing to justify. if you don't like my explanation then that's fine. insinuating that it's wrong because you don't like the result is what i would call ignorant.if you're going to call me on \"bs\" show the \"bs\". my statement was that i did not want to get into shiptypes. my statement was that if something was clearly a problem more people would support it. how is either of those incorrect in your eyes? because some issues haven't gotten support? because in your opinion it's a major issue even though very few seem to care enough to do anything about it? what other unit of measurement would you have me use when looking at issues i'm unfamiliar with?"
"i know you won't give a ****.but you're my favorite csm rep.can i call you dj scribbles?"
"i've read the logs. thus far, darius speaks up when he doesn't understand something or disagrees with something and you people are giving out to him for this? don't get me wrong, i'm an antisocial misanthrope at the best of times but, wow, a year from now, you'll have convinced yourselves that everything wrong with eve is darius' fault, and goons by extension. when you start with a wrong premise, it's hard to get a right answer. have you tried ignoring the speaker and just focusing on the content of the text?"
"done.not the best articulation of the problem, by far, but it was the best i could do in my current, sleepy state."
"i don't think this is as easy as clicking a check box and watching the results.i think the main problem with higher bonus implants is a combination of issues. as people have mentioned, a gap between old and new players will widen, as the costs involved with actually obtaining these implants will make it more difficult for new players to acquire them. second, the skill point investment to actually use them would make them harder to access.to actually implement them, i think lp reductions would need to be considered for all existing implants (alternatively a +1 bpo with a +3 invention might work but i dunno). i also think they'd also need to carefully consider of the number of skills available before they proceeded with this. finally, strategic cost reductions for everything from +1's to +5's would need to happen to bring everything into balance before introducing the +6's. this might even include skill level requirement reductions."
"if you must be nitpicky, 'benefit the majority of eve players' can probably be described better as 'provides appreciable benefit, and does not benefit the minority at the expense of the majority'"
"i have seen one linky to a chat log - apparently in rtf format. is there any plan / way to post the csm meeting chat log in the \"eve insider\", \"csm\" section?i would like to be able to read these in the raw form, but (apparently) i don't know how to read rtf .thanks for the help.ak"

"mission complete! - raised the issue this evening and it got voted through the csm"
"strictly speaking all the issues passed by the csm yesterday were past the submission deadline set by ccp yes?"
"yes. the official submission deadline was last thursday but we are relying on ccp to show 'goodwill' and accept the latest batch for discussion at the meeting..."
"while i love the design there is several points that would concern me regarding implementation.1.) transition between the current pos system and the moduler format proposed.the last thing we would want is ccp to say... \"ok those old pos mods are now scrapped and useless. to those people/alliances who have spend billions on the pos infrastructure...tough\"2.) pos protection of friendly fleets while still allowing non-protection of aggressive pos moduals (possibly already discussed)3.) pos assembly interface."
"i think that, if implemented intelligently, this could be mitigated somewhat. most of the idea presented revolves around changing the visual representation of the pos and its components.after an update which changed this feature of the station, i believe that existing pos modules and components would simply remain in space where they are, fully functional within the standards of current pos mechanics.pos managers could then re-assign locations for those modules using the new placement interface which snaps the pieces together, which doesn't put the pos very much at risk, doesn't cause the players to lose assets, and doesn't force the managers to rush around reassigning pos positions."
"very much supported!"

"no, i'm saying that if this is a problem, then it's a problem of something bigger and that pos warfare in general needs to be revised. i'm sure this would be a positive change to many pos managers but it also has negative effects on pos warfare in general."
"i feel this is a un-needed request and personally do not support it.if you want to move ships in mass use a carrier or suck it up and repackage them (lossing the rigs)."
"most of the credit for this idea comes from here:linkageevery t1 frigate for each race in eve has a t2 counterpart - interceptors, assault frigates, covert ops, and electronic attack frigates. however, the mining/cargo frigates have been completely left behind, relegated to use by trial accounts and misplaced purchases. but what role could they perform?with the advent of factional warfare and size-restricted deadspace zones, i think that it's time these poor ships received a t2 hull, a role, and some general love. what role, you ask? logistics frigates!general design principles:-reduced signature radius (improved survivability, and in line with logistics ships)-reduced mass (t1 cargo frigates are way too heavy for any kind of combat)-t2 resistances (obviously)-marauder-like bonus for remote repair systems (compensates for low slot numbers and improves sustainability)-significantly improved sensor range/resolutionlogic behind them:a frigate's biggest weakness is it's vulnerability, obviously. t2 resistances will help a little, but like interceptors, reduced signature radius will also go a long way towards saving them in an engagement. i choose to give them a marauder-style bonus to their repairers because this frees some slots for tanking (further improving survivability) and goes a long way towards cap sustainability as they'll probably be running mwds for the duration of combat. the reduced mass allows them to actually benefit from using mwds, though they should still have mass greater than average for their race. if the combination of capacitor reduction and a marauder-style role bonus is too much, you could change it to a 100% bonus to remote repair cycle time.now for some juicy examples:t2 navitas:slot layout:3 low, 3 medium, 2 high (2 turret)t1 bonuses:150% bonus to remote armor repair system and tracking link range5% reduction to signature radiust2 bonuses:10% reduction to remote armor repair capacitor use5% bonus to tracking link effectivenessrole bonus:+100% bonus to remote armor repair system transfer amountt2 bantam:slot layout:2 low, 4 medium, 2 high (2 turret)t1 bonuses:150% bonus to remote shield transfer and remote energy transfer range5% reduction to signature radiust2 bonuses:10% reduction to remote shield transfer use10% reduction to remote energy transfer userole bonus:+100% bonus to remote shield transfer amounta good idea? or another horrible brain abortion from tarminic?"
"good one tarminic! i am totally supporting this because i am in now way tarminic's alt!"
"t2ing the cargo frigates might make sense, but logistics frigates generally don't. if anything, i'd like to see it go the other way and have us get logistics battleships. the logistics cruisers don't have much survivability as-is, there's no need to make them even more fragile. how about something like making them \"logistics\" ships that actually do logistics, instead of being space medics? strip out their combat capabilities, and have them be ships designed to carry ammo and cap boosters to the front. give them a big cargo, the sig radius of an anorexic hummingbird, high agility and warp speeds, and the ability to transfer cargo without needing jetcans(or, at a minimum, the ability to jetcan every 10 seconds instead of every 3 minutes). it's something that wouldn't have a lot of use, in line with the fact that these frigates are crap, but it'd at least be new and interesting, with some possibility of utility."
"wow tarminic!when you get your hands on an idea you run with it!nicely done!i appreciate your support for my idea, it's really nice to see one of my general concepts fleshed out a bit more by someone so knowledgeable about eve in general and fitting in specific. i do hope the csm's can bring this to ccp as a possibility. it would really help out in fw warfare and fleet battles in general.mini-logistics ftw!"
"for the sake of discursive fairness, it should be mentioned there are other good ideas for these frigates doing the rounds, including in the nether regions of the thread tarminic linked to. my two other top favourites (the one in tarminic's post rounding off my dream 3) are the salvager frigate, and the gas harvesting frigate, both of which borne of the notion that these two \"mini-professions\" have no specialist ships at all."
"well, this thread is about logistics frigates. if you want discursive fairness, start your own thread and allow us to discuss your ideas on their own without hijacking someone else's thread.nothing personal, i just think those ideas deserve their own threads here to be voted yay or nay on."
"no. no point spreading several ideas in a discussion about the leftover t1 frigs into several threads, when this thread isn't likely to be overly active anyway. discussion is discussion, mon ami, and i plan on discussing every aspect of the idea in the op- including it's alternatives."

"i agree."
"artillery having the lowest dps of all long range turrets sits fine with me tbh, since it fits minmatar \"philosophy\" to forego damage for mobility and hit & run tactics (i.e. high alpha to quickly pop target and get away).after the hp boost, the said concept doesn't apply anymore, so i'd very much appreciate and recommend a boost to damage modifiers and a nerf to rof in order to keep dps where they are and increase alpha strike(and small clips won't bother us then since they will take longer to go \"click\").range and tracking are fine imo, as admittedly projectiles are not the most advanced weapons in new eden.to rectify this, and offer fleet snipers some love, maybe change the tempest to 5% dmg/lvl, 5% optimal/lvl in order to fill the sniper niche and rectify the optimal nerf scripts caused.my 2 isk.edit: corrections after sipping some coffee :p"

"supporting, i like this game a lot and there has been improvements to the stability of the client, but there's still tons of problems, lack of communication (it seems) and whatnot."
"i support this in principle, but i've got to say that if you're using linux you should know better. wine runs eve much much better than cedega (the wrapper for the 'true' linux client), and after only a few weeks when the windows premium client was released, it was stable on linux. if you use linux, you should know this mac users, on the other hand, tend to be more like windows users, and don't care. plus, they don't really have wine (i think there is a version, but it's buggy as hell.)i'd like to point out though that cedega is <i>not</i> the best choice, nor has it ever been. some users used to have cedega installed already - a full version of it - and when you install the linux eve client it nukes everything on your base install, because cedega weren't even clever enough to use different directories (it's all in ~/.cedega iirc). if ccp were to support wine instead of cedega, they would have one less client to worry about, and one less partner to worry about (at least for linux). this would mean a faster development cycle.also, there is an ideological viewpoint. cedega is well known for ripping off the latest versions of wine, altering a few things, and then selling it on without contributing back to wine - without which it wouldn't be around. i don't like that or support it. if ccp went down the wine route, they could at least help wine make wine better, thus making eve better."

"actually you have too since in essence we are talking about game design. there are industrialists and of that over arching profession there are miners, traders, builders, etc.. just like there are mercs. who in that over arching profession are soldiers, alliance members, etc...and then pirates. who arewell you get the idea. akita is just pointing out that the inherent game design is flawed because it limits the growth and scale that the many other facets of the game already have.fixing this scale for the industrialist is a known issue, one of the problems that must be tackled is the risk reward problem for miners. the risk reward is broken because of game design. those in favor of the idea are not arguing that the market is broken, nay indeed the market is working 'perfectly'. working far to perfectly given the parameters it has to work with. namely the faucets incoming, and the sinks outgoing.what is being proposed is just a simple tweak of the faucets to allow the economy of scale to change so that the risk in mining 0.0 is worth the actual reward when aggregated out over time.one would think everyone would be for this idea, since it would draw more people into uncontested space. creating more conflict, more wars, more.. well more everything for everyone....but sometimes you just can't lead the blind to water apparently."
"i can't imagine there's a problem with the risk/reward ratio of 0.0 mining - it's worth 5x what highsec mining is, and a lot of it takes place inside space secured by your alliance. even with the logistical problems associated with it(which have gone down dramatically post-rorqual, of course), it's still a valuable endeavour. and even if the risk is relatively severe, you can lose one hulk per five hours of mining and still come out ahead of a perfectly safe veld miner, assuming i remember my mining isk/hour calculations properly. besides, i can't imagine how a tweak to the faucets would change this. if 0.0 ore is the primary source of high-ends, buffing said ore will just drop the prices of high-ends until the isk/hour made by the miners returns to its current equilibrium - which, given the nature of the insurance floor, would actually drive up trit prices even further. you'd need to fix the sinks, and that's a whole hell of a lot messier than just tweaking refine rates on ores."
"kazzac...you cannot comprehend what you read very well so i'll say it again,- ore reward is player set.- mission reward is ccp set.risk is always relative, sadly that is one of the elephants in the room that everyone misses, 0.0 is different in a frigate if your 3 months old, but not so if your in a battleship and 3 years old. risk is infulenced directly by the player, it cannot be set in stone just like differentials can't due to open markets. the game design is a sandbox, we make reality, we set prices, we mitigate risk of what ccp code into the game, we make or break the game.no one should be for the idea, it is not thought out, as i said before alliances could kill high sec if they weren't polishing thier e-peens with petty squabbles, if they got together and really wanted to break the game all they have to do is embargo empire at every entrance/exit, thats designed into the game too because it is a sandbox.industrialists if they are not in control of the basic resources are at the mercy of the global market for thier imputs, trit (moon high ends too) is what keeping production limited and therfore prices/profits as high as they are, undo that bottleneck then goods and the profit margins on goods will go down as supply will blossom, that means only those industrialists with heavily researched bpo's can just about make a living (unless they form cartels), entrance to the market is delayed for a year plus for new players, you just create a new elite class sitting 23/7 in a jita station without any risk to them.sadly if i was a blind man i wouldn't drink your water as its posioned, i've still a sense of smell."
"and this is the critical mistake you keep on making, and the mistake i keep on pointing out but you just don't get it.yes, mission rewards are directly set by ccp, however, ore \"reward\" is also set by ccp, albeit indirectly.the fact the market works as well as it works, the fact that people are greedy, the fact that everybody tends to do what's more profitable most of the time and so on and so forth ends up creating the prices for each individual mineral according to quantities set by ccp and ccp alone.there's almost no individual influence in this, the scale is too large for each individual's effort to matter, and the \"market\" as a whole reacts directly to changes made by ccp, and almost only those changes alone.individual players have no relevance over here, only the crowds have any influence at all."
"wow, how convenient. how about applying the very same argument to the minerals in eve and see how your own analogy dictates that tritanium should be a lot cheaper than it is, and megagyte a lot more expensive.i don't know anything about moon mining, but the mineral costs problem is real.ccp's intent was clearly and inarguably that tritanium should be a low-cost mineral, costing perhaps between 1.00 and 1.50 isk per unit. this would have the consequence of making veldspar a low-end ore, one that has a low value per cubic meter, so that miners are encouraged to leave 1.0 and seek out more valuable ores such as pyroxeres and plagioclase in 0.8 and 0.7.but that's not how things are. things are not how they should be. instead, veldspar is consistently the most attractive high-sec ore to mine.things are not as ccp intented them to be. the mineral price balance is broken.the mineral requirement ratios for spaceships (and probably other items too) need to be changed, so that less tritanium is required, and more of the other minerals.ccp could do this in increments. every 8 or 10 weeks, they could issue a patch (or hotfix or whatever) that reduces trit requirements by 33% (cumulatively) and increases the other mineral requirements by some reasonable proportion, affecing all blueprints. after 5 or 6 such cycles, things would have much improved, and the price of tritanium would be much closer to where it should be.also, ccp should stop the spawning of intermediate ore quality type, the one 5% better than normal ore (because it is pointless to have it in the game), and then they should re-distribute ore such that only normal veldpsar is found in 1.0. to get +10% veldspar, you need to go to 0.9.likewise, only ordinary scordite is found in 0.9, and to get +10% scordite you must go visit 0.8.ordinary pyroxeres and plagioclase can be found in 0.8, as now, but to get the good +10% stuff you must visit 0.7.and so forth.ccp obviously and inarguably intended mineral prices to be at or close to certain values. minor fluctuations from these values would not be a problem, but what we've seen at least since i began playing (march 2007) can not reasonably be described as minor deviations from the intended prices."
"tbh, the reason why most moon minerals are crap is due to sov mechanics. we have all heard about the \"minerals are free\" crowd, well, basically its that kind of concept.ccp made sov pos's also be mining pos's, so you have thousands of sov pos's that mine any old crap that laying about as its pure profit since pays towards the fuel costs for sov. its not like the pos is doing anything anyway.so you end up with a oversupply of most moon minerals due to this. ccp really need to rethink sov mechanics."
"also, t1 loot drops are just crap anyway (and they're bulky crap).i'd much rather have a situation where 90% of the npc wrecks are empty but whenever i find a wreck that is non-empty i get all pleased and excited because i'll know that the loot item in the wreck is both reasonably valuable and not-too-bulky."
"qft. especially when you figure low sec and shell corporations into the mix. i remember doing some low sec moon scouting for a corp i was in, and found a \"high value\" moon, with a lightly defended pos owned by a 5 person corp. easy pickings right?wrong. within minutes of taking pot shots at the pos, one of the bigger 0.0 alliances dropped into the force field of the pos w/ a nyx and some dreads... i'll touch on the significance of this below...so, having the bottleneck be at in trit, and hence veldspar (being the best source of trit), which is arguebly the safest ore to mine, is a good thing? part of the argument being put forth is that it is less valuable to mine low sec than in high sec due to veldspar's value per m^3. there would be numerous ways to fix this on the ore end, like increasing the trit yield per m^3 in low sec somehow, but veld is so compact as it is, this would be hard to rationalize. hell, for 0.0 you could just make spod smaller than 16m^3 a unit.and your comment, \"profit margins... will go down...\" for who? t1 production already requires pe v and well researched bpos to be profitable in many cases, and t1 modules are worthless, as drops flood the market and named drops beat the base modules.at least in the realm of moon mining, most all the materials that form the bottleneck in the t2 production chain that akita mentions are slowly but surely coming under the control of a very small subset of the player base, who are contributing to the mass inflation of a few materials. lesser materials are becoming more and more saturated to the point where they aren't worth the ice to mine them (edit: lord waratron, about sov holding poses, i didn't think about that, that explains a lot). hell, i spent time running the math, and for the most part, any of the first two tiers of materials you mine at a loss.in either case, your argument of \"... entrance to the market is delayed for a year plus for new players...\" falls flat. those skills and that research takes time, maybe not a year, but definitely a few months. and \"... you just create a new elite class sitting 23/7 in a jita station without any risk to them.\" as opposed to the current elite class who hardly have to play, as they make billions jumping a carrier full of moon materials to empire every few days/weeks? at least that's some risk, right?"
"my $0.02: something should be done to make low sec more attractive to organized miners & industrialists, especially newer players. lowering trit requirements for manufacturing across the board, tweaking trit yields in low sec ore, or slightly increasing trit and lowering other yields from alloys could achieve some results on the t1 front. if done very slowly it shouldn't cause a catastrophic crash in the market.messing with rat drops, is quite the double edged sword. removing manufactured t1 drops wouldn't really help budding industrialists, you'd be removing isk from mission runners while jacking up the cost of thier fittings. named drops would still be better and would probably jump in price as well... unless you removed those as well, then t2 fittings would probably sky rocket. this is speculation, but it's just common sense, the if you remove a large chunk of supply from the market costs are going to sky rocket.and for moon mining, make it so that the less valuable materials have more varied uses. that should help drive up the prices from the being just all around losers.goumindong's idea from pg.1 is an interesting idea, but a little to simple. it makes more moons targets for camping at, sure, but depending on the moon mineral to moon mineral reactions it'd be very easy to for certain materials to remain near worthless or wind up with a tritanium problem, where market forces cause easy and common materials to be worth more than the rare materials.pang grohl's idea is a little more refined, but could easily suffer from the same problems as above.bimbo's response on the other hand, i think was a neat idea; making it possible to invent t2 bpcs that made use of different materials at some other research material cost. of course saying that this will somehow make less strain on the db than just adding different types of bpos... so instead you're adding variations on bpcs to the database? anyway, an interesting idea.i think akita's concerns have merit, and wouldn't mind more developer scrutiny on this complex subject so a big please visit your user settings to re-enable images.."
"indirectly set and infulenced by players is very different to hard coding, also the quantities are not directly set by ccp, the ratio of minerals derived from ores and reprocessing is, but the amount available is a player variable, we decide not ccp what to do, mine make etc.... the base price is a red herring, can't you understand that.crowd actions are made up of individual actions, that are driven by perception and not reality, america as a crowd perceived \"direct and inniment danger from wmd's\", \"welcomed with flowers\", \"it will pay for its self\", \"they hate us for our freedoms\" the're all bullocks, plain for all to see if individuals actually looked at the facts, you are just pointing at the sky to divert attention to the failings of your perception."
"not exactly. it cost approximatly the same to mine the same volume of gold bearing rock than copper bearing rock, but you get grams of gold for each ton of ore while you gent much more copper from each ton of copper bearing ore. so when you look the end product, gold cost more to produce than the same weight of copper."
"you obviously have no idea how the faucets and sink in the game work with regards to the minerals market and insurance, so really any further discussion with you is pointless at this time."
"umm captial costs are the same, pit and tunnels in same type of rock, material handling the same, crushing the rock for processing costs the same per unit, they use the same infrastructure which costs the same, its only the final processing stage that different. its like to train skills for a hulk and processing ores etc cost the same no matter what you mine, they are the/our captial costs, they are the requirement for extraction of ore into a useable commodity.the price of the end product over cost of extraction/refining per m3 ore determins how low a quality of ore you ecomonically mine.the price of the infrastructure remains the same, viability is set by end product price, high price means low grade ore becomes more cost effective.so gold costs more as less rich ores are mined, it only has the high price that makes it possible because of rarity, but which of the two commodities gives the best price return over captial invested in infrastructure?, copper, just like veldspar."
"i do understand, base price is arse hattery, insurance is really a disconnected token (doesn't reflect real cost prices that are player set) because base price is arse hattery. its a sand box, the only large scale effective isk/mineral sink there is, is getting blown up ffs, building things sinks isk in production cost, but the minerals are there still in the market until they go pop.the game mechanics just appear complex like your life, but everything you do is either driven by food, fornication or fear, three very basic principles."
"that's where you are mistaken and the crux of the issue. insurance is a faucet just like loot drops. insurance dramatically affects how each mineral is priced, in fact it one of two things insuring that pye and iso are staying as low as it does right now. loot drops being the other."
"remember why insurance was finally introduced? it was to buffer the pain on noobs, it wasn't made to be a faucet of isk into the game, but as a pacifier to stupid ppl who can't run their character successfully in a no holds bared sandbox.what you say actually points to what i said, insurance is broken, its not related to the market or risk but to a base price that was irelevent 1 day after it was set. insurance is broken, it should be linked to (universal mean price of ship on matket + universal mean price of materials to make ship) / (modifier for grade of insurance) * (security level of system where destruction of ship occured).so (1,000,000 + 600,000) / 3 (or 2 or 4 depending on grade if insurance) * 0.5, so 533,333 * 0.5 = 266,666. (or 400,000 or 200,000).see what happens, base price is done away with, it becomes totally dependent on the market and the inherient risk status of the system they were in.ok, insurance as an isk faucet, it is only printing money not resources, but its a cost as well, you have to pay for it and not everybody collects on thier payment, so the effect is not overly great, dr e said so iirc."
"and to be perfectly honest, there are players who have a greater understanding of the market, the game, the faucets, and the sink than dr e has...and any event. i support the op. it's a known issue to ccp and has mild support for fixing.i'm tired of getting trolled this week."
"the op says nothing about insurance, only about:lack of alternative spec'd bpo's for existing products?that human greed infulences the game?lack of stuff to use under utilised base goods on (see point 1)?that risk/reward is set in stone?"
"oh, i'll argue that. won't even take me long - the \"base price\" of tritanium is 2 isk per unit. if ccp had any particular price in mind, it'd be that one. mind you, they generally haven't been so stupid as to fix the market to work the way they think it \"should\", but even if they were that dumb your price would still be wrong."
"the point is to move people from high sec to low sec to 0.0 at some point to make more isk. no matter what the price of the minerals are if veldspar in .4 space yields twice the trit of veldspar from 1.0 space then you make more isk/hour in low sec. there are already 3 types of every ore in game. adjust the modifiers and seperate them across bands. i would prefer up to 6 types to cover all the sec bands but 3 types could be workable. it doesn't require tons and tons of blueprint manipulation or additional items.insurance should also be based on frequency of pay out if we are talking real life here. i could do without insurance myself but if it stays then if you lose a ship every 3 hours you should pay more or get less for your insurance than i do if i lose a ship every 6 weeks at most."
"it would be much better if insurance didn't pay out cash at all, but instead paid out a minerals voucher, equal to the minerals that went into building the ship, minus some percentage (20% for platinum insurance, 40% for gold, 60% for silver, perhaps), but to actually get the minerals, you have to fly to a station owned by the insurance corporation.in practice, people would not then claim their own minerals, but would instead sell their vouchers to buy orders on the market, and these voucher buyers would then transport vouchers en masse to stations to redeem them for minerals, which they can sell or use for production.that's even further divorced from base prices than your proposal is, which makes it better. (and if i predict correctly, so that many players enter the voucher purchasing trade, then the transition will be almost seamless for all pilots.)"
"i actually really like the mineral voucher proposal. it then really is completely player priced without the horrors of shifting markets and regional price fixing by alliances."
"personally i think that as the starting point skills wise has changed so much the original reason that insurance was bought in to the game no longer exists. it could be removed totaly from the game, but all those insurance company stations are now in the game and removal is not an option as the story line has to be kept."
"an interesting proposal, but i don't like it. too deflationary. make it market-based, to remove the floor, and then leave it alone."
"i think the prices are somewhat off, too,"
"i don't knw what the solution is but something has to be done about the balance of risk/reward in eve. it just doesn't make sense the way it is right now."
"i've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours reading this entire thread/conversation/argument. since i've invested that much time reading your thoughts, please take a moment to read mine. i promise that it won't take longer than a few minutes, and while that might cost some of you some serious \"loss-of-isk-makin-time,\" it might shed some light on why this kind of change is *absolutely* necessary.i learned some new things by spending those hours reading this thread. for those of you who have been playing this game for so long that you think you actually fly a ship in outer space, please ignore the blatant whining, crying, boo-hooing, etc. that follows below. i pay for the privilege of playing just like you do.some of what i learned from this highly-enlightened discussion:(1) \"criminals\" seem to have it made. criminals have all of 0.0 space to themselves. criminals have all of \"low-sec\" space to themselves. criminals now want all of \"hi-sec\" space to themselves and believe pve players are just like npcs.(2) i am not allowed to insure my ships for anywhere close to their actual value. cnr max insurance is a joke. 109m-32m(cost)=77m return on a 500m ship (net loss 423m +). hulk max insurance is a joke. 29m-9m(cost)=20m return on a 100m ship (net loss 80m +).(3) because i'm successful in running missions, and wish to become more successful, means that i am a loser, should not play the game, and/or should be the target of every criminal in \"hi-sec\" space. i ruin game-play for everyone else in the game.some simple observations for those who are so removed from reality that you can't see straight:-contrary to popular belief, mission-running is not without risk, particularly solo. i've lost many ships while trying to complete missions even with the help of others. it's called a learning experience, and i realize it takes time to get to *your* skill level of uber-leetness. until that time, i'll be taking that risk when i head into level3 or level4 missions by myself, or even with a small group of friends.-mining roid fields isn't without risk either. as you gankers are *well* aware, these mining ships aren't very defendable, and probably take very little of your skill or ammo to destroy. sometimes you even come by and try to can-flip me, or otherwise tempt me into dispatching my 5 meager drones on your uber-exhumer-killer. i might be weak, outnumbered, and outgunned, but i'm not stoopid my friend.-gankers are like folks who would sit in a rowboat over a school of fish dropping hand-grenades in the water. they complain about how un-economical it is to waste a perfectly good hand-grenade on such small fish. they feel that they are entitled to get their money back on the rowboat when they were the ones who blew the damned thing up in the first place. besides, you already control 2/3 or even 3/4 of the damned lake you fish in. -for those who would tell me to shut up, that this is a \"mmo\" and that \"you don't participate\" by \"doing what we do,\" i say this: this game is *clearly* setup for solo and small-time corporation play. it seems to be intended to serve the needs of the many. (i *do* participate, just not with you)i fully support this idea- you shouldn't be given insurance payments on your concord'ed ships, especially when ccp can't provide me with a way to insure my own ships.you think i'm a crybaby, and i think you're a crybaby.clearly, i'm not a \"normal\" eve player by your definition. i don't have your evil streak, your malcontent attitude towards others, your greed stamina, or your general self-centered nature in the game. i'm not saying that this game should be without you. you stay on your side, and i'll stay on mine... when i feel i have enough skillpoints, ships, and isk to counter your uber-leetness, i will venture into low-sec space and try to kick your butts. until then, i have rocks to mine, and missions to run.i've said my piece.-buzz"

"what criminals are these that occupy all of 0.0? could you give a list of criminals? and what constitutes these guys being criminals anyway? there are a few large alliances and individual corps that do not allow piracy or any form of it. and as far as lo-sec i am sure jade might argue with you about sf being a criminal organization. i am not sure if there are or they are not really but i am sure he can comment about it. i do believe if you read about who they are and how they present themselves criminal activity os not one of there main pursuits. its more of a political rp thing. and yes pirates (and anti-pirates) inhabit lo-sec but very few of these guy venture into 0.0.i understand you did read the entire thread, that is more than some will do to really try to understand the issue. however from you statements like the one above it does show your experience of is less than worldly. there is nothing wrong with feeling the way you do, but it sounds like what you are saying is \"they have their area to play i want my area off limits.\" am i close? the insurance bit is true. but look at the other proposals about the insurance. they are pushing to get rid of it all together. not only for the removal from being concorded, but actually remove it from the game."
"from the title i got the impression it would be a lame suggestion. but it's in fact the remove insurance payoff if you get killed by concordvery good idea and preety simple.approved!"
"i agree that there should be a thumbs down option.apart from that i discagree with the rest of what you say. and here is why.1) people that get the security hit can get back the lost security status with the rating/mission runing. they do it anyway.2) lets imagine a common situation. a marauder pimped with faction/commander stuff is playing it right and warps to 0 etc. of course when he jumps on the other side he gets ganged by several insured torp ravens with tech 1 equipment.the ravens get back the cost of losses to the concord minus the cost of tech 1 trop launchers and other tech 1 stuff that is ridiculusly low. while you kill an 1 bilion ship and get the modules probably costing all together several bilions while you lost after insurance maximun 10millions each. without the insurance the cost would be alltogether near 1 billion again but you would gain around 2 billions from the faction stuff so net gain 1 billion profit isn't enough?as it is now gangers may gang anything,not just the pimped navy bs/marauder with the faction/officer stuff but even a normal bs with tech 2 stuff could be a target. even a freighter with scrap metal would be a target. i was thinking to learn freighter skill and i don't because of this. because when the gangers are losing 0 due to the insurance it's very possible to kill your freighter loaded with scrap metal just for the excitement. that is why i favor this idea. so you still will have profit by ganging the very tempting targets but at least the rest of the players who may fly just a marauder with tech 2 or a bs with some occasional faction module will be safer. what you are doing now is more or less an exploit of the game mechanics."
"pvpers =/= criminals. so you can remove nullsec from the equation. you could argue that pirates are criminals because concord dislikes them. i personally disagree with this, because most pirates i know are looking for pvp, and any profits they make are a side benefit.if you want the improved performance of faction or t2 ships, you have to live with the drawback of not having much insurance to fall back on. otherwise there would be no reason to use t1 ships unless you didn't have the skills for t2. pvpers deal with this issue on a daily basis, and most of us don't ***** about it.if you want to pimp out a ship, that's fine. nobody is arguing you shouldn't be able to do that. what you have to understand is the more you pimp your ship, the more you should be gankable. the difference in opinions (among the sensable people) is over what level of pimpness you should have before you should start worrying.if you haven't figured out how to run level 4s safely by the time you decide to start pimping out a navy raven, i have zero sympathy for you. there are websites that tell you exactly how to run each and every mission in a manner that practically eliminates the risk by preventing unwanted aggro. at this point in time mission running is more of a science than an art.mining barges also tend to drop, in the grand scheme of things, very poor loot (with the possible exception of people who use entirely unnecessary deadspace boosters to tank). there are much better uses of sec status. and yes, sec status recovery is a serious penalty. there is only one way for me to increase it, shooting npcs. i can't bribe concord, can't shoot pirates, can't do anything but carebear to recover sec. so even though i may be making money while ratting, i'm still being forced to do something i don't like. this game is clearly set up to encourage team play, not solo. the fact that strategic aspects such as capitals, outposts, sovereignty, and even factional warfare require multiple people to achieve should clue you into that. eve tolerates the solo player, it is not designed for it. you can't do everything in eve solo. sorry."
"these can't be level 4 missions because i havent come close to losing my cnr to a level 4 mission."
"remember, you still have to look how each recon \"tanks\" as well.1) the rook tanks by jamming2) the arazu tanks by dampening3) the rapier tanks by speed + range4) the pilgrim tanks by sucking enough cap to fuel his reppers.even with just using a nos and cap boosters, there i can only tank for.. 45 seconds abouts. this is with recon 5, energy emissions, yada yada yada.only if tracking disruptors affected missile boats and drones, i would agree to giving amount nos amount for range. it really needs both to be effective, or a tanking bonus.why not just give the cyno bonus to black ops (they have the *laugh* tank to stand up to a hit or 2), and give all recons an inert tanking bonus instead?1) rook: shield bonus (why.. i have no idea, because caldari are shield tankers)2) gallente: rep amount bonus3) rapier: speed bonus4) pilgrim: hp or resist bonusdamage wise, if you get rid of the damage the drones do on the pilgrim, it will be the deathblow to the ship, since not only are drones easily killed, they won't do crap for damage, therefore, increasing the amount of time you are getting hit."

"seriously, did you read any of those meeting reports? #3 is a real stunner ya know.if you think this is about in game politics you're missing the point.i do agree on the democracy part but jade didn't get voted to bloat his ego some more. he got voted to be a csm chairman and failing to fulfill that role badly. especially at the failing to acknowledge your own mistakes part. if you're not willing to be reasonable its impossible to work together as a team."

"speaking for myself, i'd prefer nano assault frigates to nano assault cruisers. i've got no objection to frigs being able to buzz around my head too fast for a battleship to swat."
"you are aware that assault frigs have on average 60% more mass than their t1 hulls, while all hacs have equal or less mass than their t1 hulls, right? and you are aware, that since afs base speed would be much lower than an interceptor (with the exception of the proposed jaguar which imo should not get the 5% speed bonus) and their mass would still be slightly higher, their overall achievable speeds would be much less than interceptors and more around the realms of normal t1 frigates?is it so wrong that frigates should be quick and agile?i recomend that you re-evaluate your thought process, and once you realize that assault frigates should actualy handle like frigates, and that no cruiser should have an align time faster than an assault frigate(*), and that no mwd fit battleship should be able to outpace an mwd fit assault frigate(**)... im sure you will realize that they desperatly need a mass reduction. *stabber and caracal, aligns as fast or faster than all afs but the jaguar. the most slugish afs (vengeance and ishkur) have the same align time as a friggin' vexor. this is calculated with spaceship command 5, evasive manuvering 5, no implants, and no fitting mods or rigs.**harpy and hawk fit with only a t2 mwd have a lower top speed than a typhoon with only a t2 mwd fit. this is with my skills (navigation 5, acceleration control 4) as well as all skills 5. yes, i know this doesnt take into account time for acceleration and ship manuverability, but the fact stands that a battleship *can* go faster than an equaly fit frigate."
"i agree that afs need a review.if it's this review i don't know. the proposal is good in any case.one side effect of making the afs faster is that they do become a somewhat overpowered to/against interceptors."
"i no likey. the wolf has been a great platform in what it does because it uses ac's to great effect with the bonus to falloff. when you look at minmatar ships you see: optimal = arty, falloff = ac (usually, there are cases where falloff works to both) you may have switched em around by accident, but i wanted to point that out.other than that, i like the idea behind it. it would give them the buffs they need."
"err... was no mistake...this is something the community was asking for a long time, to switch the bonus around.jaguar has more speed, less pg and less turrets while the wolf has less speed more pg and more turrets, this leads to jaguar favoring acs while the wolf can make good use as an artie plataform, good enough to compete with the trasher imo.more like the vaga and the munin."
"let me first state again that i fully support a reworking of afs in general. no need for second thoughts there. just this suggested solution...actually looking at my current setups for my afs i think they might outpace most tech-1 frigates with a massive mass reduction. (apart from the fastest racial frigates like vigil ofc).well, let's pull the interdictors into the equation then. my stabber outpaces my 'dictor if i fit it accordingly quite easily. if the \"revamped\" afs outpace the interdictors after a change i'd see that as not exactly balanced, considering their heavy tank/firepower...i see where you're coming from and can accept the reasoning behind the op. but... in terms of overall balance i'd like to be the assault frigates on par in terms of firepower and tank with most cruisers, having a very slight speed/agility advantage and rather some other \"extra\". like a partial ew invulnerability or resistance towards webbing. it is unfortunate that they are often compared to hacs as those are more and more a domain of nano-ing to boot, but that does not necessarily mean afs have to go the same way. taking into account they still all lack one bonus, the opportunity to implement a more unconventional feature is there, i think. absolutely. but isn't that more due to some ships (setups) in terms of speed already being somewhat imba? thus the problem rather residing with the unbalanced ship than the afs in general? i mean, the same reasoning could be applied to most intys and the vagabond for example (which i think is mostly okay). and i really cannot see the advantage of having afs go at speeds that outpace slower intys in the future. nanoships and \"my speed pwns y'all\" have already a far too big role in current eve-o for my likings."

"to the cva boys, point taken but any increase will just be used in the exact way its done now. you would like to identify more unsavory characters, its been stated, unlimited reds, sweet. now to the guy quoted above, if the player negotiations lead to gangs which crash nodes, then we have a problem. and its not about people shooting each other, clearly you have missed the point of 0.0 alliance warfare as of 2008. the ui is linked to the blue list. ccp should take a simple look and deciede, how many blues can an alliance of a certain size have. so that way you can't get 3 4000 man alliances blueing themselves + smaller alliances to form 15000 pilot blocks which destroy the node. thats what i am getting at. if they lock the blues out of the overview, then so much of what is bad about eve that goes on in 0.0 will cease. the naptrains will stop, people will have to think hard about who they befriend, and when somethin goes down, realize they can't phone 12000 of their closest friends to come help when they pick a fight"

"yeah i couldn't understand the reasoning there either. the nighthawk issue was well documented and argued and i felt i'd represented the best points in this thread in my docs. i felt it was a pretty clear case. that this failed and the far less well-argued battleship autocannon buff passed seemed a bit random.especially since i fly all 4 races of command ship and do find the nh to be rubbish in pvp. and i fly all 4 races of battleship and find battleship autocannons to be pretty good actually. ah well, we enter strange worlds when we enter the world of ship and module balancing."
"this may be (more than a little) bit late, but /signed.having to run two rcu's to fit an active-tanked ham nighthawk is, in a word, stupid."
"a few points of interest for passing readers1. this thread is concerned with pvp balance, specifically the powergrid of the nighthawk, its ease of fitting, its balance relative to the other field cs and its ability to fulfil its intended role of gang support. pve balance is discussed only in terms of the implication of suggested changes. ships should be balanced in both pve and pvp.2. the field cs are intended to fit a gang mod. the other field cs can fit a gang mod using 0-1 fitting mods or rigs, depending on fit. a comparable nighthawk fit requires three. this is not balanced.3. the other field cs are significantly more flexible  the astarte and abso can choose to fit tackle or ewar, while the sleipnir is a fine nanoboat. the nighhawk has no such options or flexibility  it is a simple tank and gank ship4. the nighthawk has no range advantage over the other field cs in pvp. in pvp, missiles are a close-range weapon; in general they are not useful sniper weapons, because of flight time and explosion velocity issues. this is particularly pertinent when the nighthawks useless precision bonus is borne in mind. eft may say that hms have a 70 km range  but their effective range is the same as that of hams; it is limited to tackle range. 5. the nighthawks precision bonus is utterly useless in pvp. in addition, the intended antisupport missiles of the nighthawk  precision heavies  are broken, being worse than precision cruise in all pvp situations that occur.6. a comparison with other missile ships is useful. base pgs:a. caracal: 530, for 5 launchersb. cerberus: 635, for 5 launchersc. onyx: 835, for 5 launchers and a wtfg field thingied. drake: 850, for 7 launcherse. nighthawk: 710, for 6 launchers and a gang mod7. a comparison with the sleipnir, as the other shield-tanking field cs, is also useful. we have already established that the nighthawk enjoys no useful range advantage over an ac sleipnir, allowing us to broadly compare fits with amls, hmls and hamls with fits with dual 180s, 220s and 425s, respectively. nano fits are disregarded here since the nighthawk is not a viable nanoship; all fits have mwd and cap booster:gang mod, top-tier weapons, named xlsb.sleipnir: 2 fitting mods requirednighthawk: 5 fitting mods requiredgang mod, top-tier weapons, lsb iisleipnir: no fitting mods requirednighthawk: 3 fitting mods requiredno gang mod, top-tier weapons, named xlsb.sleipnir: no fitting mods requirednighthawk: 4 fitting mods requiredno gang mod, top-tier weapons, lsb iisleipnir: no fitting mods requirednighthawk: 2 fitting mods required"
"dunno whether its apathy or ignorance but this is a pretty good example of how horrid the csm is."
"ah well, thanks for trying jade. i knew voting for hardin was wise. serenity steele's utter apathy to the problem and complete unwillingness to educate himself on the issues is absolutely staggering, however. 'wilfull ignorance' isn't a quality one wishes to see associated with csm's. of course, what's worse is the suggestion that ccp should check for the total population of nighthawks to see if there's an issue - this goes beyond ignorance to an outright lack of intelligence. in fact, the flaws in suggesting we balance for pvp based on pve is so resoundingly self evident that i have to conclude that serenity steele knows this, and is simply using it as a smokescreen to cover up some other agenda. i believe this inconsistency can be fairly easily explained: they fly minmatar ships, they don't fly caldari ships. hence, very specific and clearcut fix to an obvious flaw in a caldari ship is shot down, while vague 'please make us more betterer' requests for minmatar ships are given an enthusiastic thumbs up."

"i don't think the 2 month old guy who got one shotted in his caracal (since the only way to actually get kill rights is to not fight back) would be very happy either. more likely it'll be someone in an unarmed hauler handing off kill rights... translation (what i hear, at least): wha-ah, i can no longer pop defenseless players with impunity. there are suddenly consequences for my actions. umm, the offended would be hiring a single mercenary (as opposed to a whole corp) to do their dirty work. as a plus, this would let you hire mercs to even go after even people who hide in npc corps. the \"hard core pvper's\" should rejoice at that. and you'd have to be aggrieved to hire the merc, so you couldn't hire a bounty hunter for stupid oog reasons.exploitable, sure. but what bounty system, proposed or currently in game, isn't? it's at least worthy of discussion/refinement. the revision to the bounty system sabrina proposed in the other thread has it's own issues as well."

"well i don't know how your using it or fitting (mwd, wd, web?) so can't say your wrong but i find it hard to believe the maelstrom is the best short-range solo/small gang bs when there's ships like hyperion that can tank similar and tackle with more speed + agility.i do like the idea of increase ac damage and change maelstrom rof bonus to damage bonus to keep people happy and help the tempest vs maelstrom comparisons. but as with most changes this affects the arty discussions so really have to fix the whole lot or one at a time and knowing ccp they will go with one at a time.i certainly wouldn't complain about large projectiles if:1. maelstrom given dmg bonus instead of rof. hell yeah real alpha!2. ac damage increased slightly.3. hail fixed and t1 ammo range updated for todays eve.4. tremor given falloff bonus.although i suspect even then tempest would still need \"something\".while away for the week i'll probably use pen and paper and make epic topic (no eft! just experience and memory) to type up when back home."

"from the original '(idea) bounty hunter: rights to kill in empire',i remade the title since the idea developped lots since the initial one thanks to all the feedback and idea of the community.so right now the bounty system is pretty useless, the only place to collect a bounty legally is in 0.0, in a war or make him take your can... which in my opinion; this way of collecting is broken.so we should redesign the bounty system and add a new funway of making isk in eve by adding a new job: bounty hunter.first, the bounty system change: a player could still put a bounty in any designated station (in aggressive mode vs the target), but to be a bounty hunter and to claim the reward it will all be done with concord within a concord station. secondly, conditions to be a bounty hunter:here are some ways we could develope the bounty hunter skill with the killing license, the player would have a choice of wich type of license he wants to buy depending on is bounty hunter skill lvl:so we give the bounty hunter a choice of a limited number of kills for an unlimited time for a higher price, or an unlimited number of kills with a limited time for a lower price.so, here is the bounty hunter job, a fun new way to make isk in eve, as for the 'grief'(put 0.01 isk randomly), it won't happen since the players needs to be in aggressive mode. and to claim the reward, the player will need all the bounty hunter requirement (buy a license, skills, standings etc...) all feedbacks and ideas are welcome, i think this is going somewhere, and i hope to have support from a delegate or a ccp member ^^thank you"
"i support this idea"
"i support it."
"so ... i should be able to put a bounty of 0.01 isk on you so my friend can go into empire space and kill you with impunity.bad idea.and no, the amount of money should not matter. there are plenty of people who would throw away large sums of isk just to **** with someone."
"interesting concept.how about a dedicated \"bounty hunter\" skill? to accept bounties you have to have the skill, and the skill level also increases the level of bounties you can take. ie:bh-l1 = no bounties more than 1 million isk.bh-l2 = no bounties more than 10 million iskbh-l3 = no bounties more than 100 million iskbh-l4 = no bounties more than 1 billion iskbh-l5 = unlimited bounty levelyes, you will get some people using the bounty system to \"grief\" other characters, but is that any worse than say, jetcan piracy? obviously, there would have to be some kind of limit as to how long a bounty can remain active, and how many times you can place a bounty on someone before it's considered harassment, but that could be worked out easily.very cool concept, especially if it's offered as a skill, it could be a fully legitimate profession, and would fix the broken bounty system as it stands now.edit: to assist in preventing griefing, no bounty can be less than 100,000 isk, and no player character may have a new bounty placed on them for at least 7 days after a bounty has been collected. bounty time periods and cost increases follow exactly the same price rules that wars follow."
"i like this idea. but perhaps to counter dippin' dots' argument to this idea, security status could be factored in as well. it doesnt make sense to me that engaging a player in high sec who has a negative security status + a bounty should be a punishable offense."
"it makes no sense whatsoever to see people show up on the empire jump gate bulletin boards with bounties, but oh hey you can't actually shoot at them because of ******ed kill rights mechanics in empire. i don't believe 0.01 is a valid bounty, and bounties should have a minimum cap on them, anyway. probably 1m, but it could depend on the security status.exactly. what do you think a \"bounty\" is? it's a reward for killing someone. who's heading up the bounty system? why, it's your good old friend, concord.if you can pay concord to let you have kill rights in empire for \"war\", then you should be able to pay concord to let someone have global kill rights.imagine what it could do to jihadswarm. if someone blows up your hulk, you could place a bounty on their head instead of having to pay merc corps. it's the same basic idea as hiring the merc corp, but without that extra level of interaction."
"i think it is a great idea. supported"
"it still leaves open the griefing element. player a wants to kill playercharacter b, so:player a pays playercharacter c 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter b.player a kills playercharacter b.player a pays playercharacter d 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter b.player a kills playercharacter b.player a pays playercharacter e 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter b.player a kills playercharacter b.player a pays playercharacter f 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter b.player a kills playercharacter b.player a gets a warning from ccp that his repeated killing of another players characters is under suspicion of greifing.player a pays his friend player z 1 million isk who can pay playercharacter g 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter b.player a has his friend player z kill playercharacter b.rinse and repeat.the only way it would work is if a bounty of this sort can only be placed on you once every long-interval-of-time. and it would need to be a very long interval at that.in addition to the above problem, you can easily get a situation where every member of corp a opens a bounty (not necessarily at the same time) against every member of corp b. effectively allowing them to go to war at a cost much lower than through a war-dec."
"sadly the system would have to be more intuitive than that. the system would have to check, among other things, if the person who placed the bounty;1. belongs to the same corp2. is in the friend's list3. is an alt4. an account payed with the same cc5. has attained recent contact with them6. traded items with them via contracts (private dealing)"
"if it worked in a sane way it would be fine. in addition to my last post about greifing, i'll offer a third abusive scenario:player a goes into noobspace with an alt, writes down the name of every person he sees, then switches to a more developed character who has earned the right to put bounties on people (i'm assuming this is a necessary hurdle, even though no one has bothered to suggest it yet) on which he puts a bounty of no economical consequence such as 0.01 isk. his buddy player z accepts all those contracts and goes into noobspace and slaughters everyone.while its a funny story, it's still a bad idea.note that player a and player z could easily avoid the afformentioned checks by simply communicating via some messenger system instead of being corpmates or anything of that nature that eve would be able to validate.there are lots of ways around this system. creative greifers will find them and abuse them. just look at suicide ganking."
"let bounties be an isk sink. allow them to increase the level and intensity of navy faction spawns in empire space. and let those spawns give no loot, nor salvage."
"yes, why not?in my idea you will need to buy rights to pod a bounty. so if you want to put a 0.01 isk bounty and your friend pays for exemple 1m isk for a kill its his choice and loss. i see it like so, he bounty hunter pays:1m isk = 1 kill right5m isk = 2 kills rights10m isk = 3 kills rightsetc...could be more or less, but it makes the bounty hunter choose his prey carefully and not shot a random bounty target. he paid 1m for a kill and kills a 40m bounty that is good business. but to kill a 0.01 isk to 1m isk bounty would be a waste since he lose more than he wins."

"i don't like it, because it encourages new players to waste skill points. 1500 per rat per level is a massive boost to the l1 missioner - ded connections 5 can literally double your bounties across the board. in l2 missions, it's still enough to encourage you to spend your money on it, but by the time you get to l4s the money gained is just a joke. instead of adding 100%, it adds 2%. and all of a sudden, you have a ****ed off recently-noobish player who wasted what feels like a lot of skill points for very little reward. now, what i would like them to do is remove the unobtainable skills from the game entirely. not the ones like mfo, that are hard-limited but available, but the ones like ded connections that, to my knowledge, simply don't exist. quit deceiving us and filling up lists with useless information. also, if you can remove all the really weird ones from the database(you ever looked at evemon's non-public skills? ugh.), that'd be cool too. i know why polaris has to be there, but the rest should go."

"whilst the ops idea is not going to be too helpfull, moon materials, specificaly promithium and disprosium, are having a massive knock on effect in the whole market right now; around 90% of t2 items require disprosium in their construction, and yet it is one of the rarest resources. this has lead to a new monopoply akin to the t2 monopolies of the past, and i think some solution needs to be found to address this.i agree with the poster making the comment about territory; i've had a lot of fun fighting over moons myself. but at the same time we cannot afford to have a game based around monopolies in a few resources attainable only to a few, who can use those resources to attain an unassailable postition of power.-this oppinion is mine, and not my corperatin's or alliance's-"

"i think it should be somewhat like mining asteroids. your deposit dissapears and another deposit is found. i would favor having a 6 month supply when found though and the possibility of the deposit growing. this way you can choose to mine it at the rate it recharges for a long time or throw a bunch of harvesters on it and suck it dry.the 6 month supply with 1 harvester is simply to justify setting up a pos. 1 month is to short for the horrors of pos setup."
"there is a huge investment in both time and isk to put up an pos and all associated arrays and batteries. this op must never had to spend two days putting up pos, arrays and batteries. this is mind numbing to say the least. the above is not a solution to the moon mineral problem.a better thread to look at for a resolution to this issue would be found here."

"what i object to is your frequent use of the word \"objective\" in describing yourself and your posts. you've used it in many of your posts in an attempt to give yourself a veneer of impartial neutrality. in reading your posts it's obvious you're anything but impartial or neutral. you, yourself, have now plainly stated you lean toward piracy and that is what has been seen in your posts. claiming objectivity when your posts are from a subjective position is deceit. your point of view is that of a pirate and your posts support that view.unlike yourself i've never pretended to be impartial, neutral or objective. i've been very clear about my position and where my viewpoint stems from. therefore my credibility is intact. something that can't be said for you.i stalk people? hmmm. lets examine that using one of your favorite phrases, \"by your reasoning\". by your reasoning i stalk pirates (all of them), griefers, people who are dishonest (calling them on their bull), all people who have anything to do with anything i'm interested in........well that just about covers all of eve. in summary i stalk all of eve? and i remind you of a mysterious someone? that foil hat fitting you okay? looks like it might be a tad tight.show me where i said or implied that goons were pirates. as far as i can recall that's never happened in any of my posts on any subject. goons are griefers. this is not an insult to goons as they embrace it. pirates are not necessarily griefers, though some are. griefers are not necessarily pirates, though some are. that having been said, they pursue much the same course in the game with regard to use of game mechanics. the game mechanic which benefits a griefer benefits pirates as well. in other words, when you argue for introduction of a game mechanic that benefits pirates, you most often are arguing for a game mechanic which benefits griefers as well and therefore you may as well be a goon for the purposes of that arguement. since a lot of pirates don't care much for griefers, considering them low class, i can well understand your objection to an implication you might be a goon. if you'll take a moment to read the second paragraph of post 26 in this thread, you'll see that i stated i was wrong to suggest you might be a goon alt.that first sentence is wonderful and worthy of the title \"politician\". in one sentence you accuse me of trying to silence you, suggest you're above that yourself and try to tie me to some of the unfortunate business in the csm meetings. it's worthy of rove himself. too bad it's utter rubish, but i do admire the way it's crafted. simple, short and jam packed with deceitful innuendo.i'm not trying to mute you or shout you down. anymore than you are attempting to mute or shout down myself and others.windjammer"

"it would appear to be a lost cause. the cms reps like most politicians care only about their image, power, and re-electability. while i admire their desire to get right into the issues and get some responses out of ccp, the deeper value and intent the csm can potentially offer eve is beyond the cares of most players.it's sadly mirrors how readily people have thrown their rights away after terrorist events of recent years."

"just what this process needs more bureaucracy to bicker over to distract everyone from doing work. /countersigned"
"almost uniformly terrible ideas. an overcomplicated mess of value only to barrack-room lawyers and people interested more in the political powerplays than anything actually getting done.no support."
"i can remember around a dozen posts of you and the other members of the csm trying to figure out just what you're supposed to be doing, and what your powers were supposed to be, and you're still planning to rely on ccp to provide you with clarification and \"permission\" to nominate your own leaders. a document like this and its bylaws allows a new set of representatives to avoid all that nonsense and waste of time arguments without dependancy on vague and unreliable word-of-mouth hand-me-down descriptions of how they're supposed to function. \"fly by the seat of your pants\" methods rarely work well.it's not as if the current unfounded csm isn't full of powerplays."
"only this part.you join fw, you get an extra chat channel, the militia channel you joined. ask for an invite in militia channel and get into a fleet. the first fleet i got into was about 80 people. it took me about 10 minutes to get to the fleet itself, but was never alone. no pvp experience needed."
"i don't really understand what the issue is, its not like when you leave corp you can never talk to the same people or fly with them again. i left my corp for fw but still do stuff with them. the faction militia corps are pretty much noob corps as well so if you want to help people learn the game thats not a bad place either. plus if you're in high sec you're pretty much safe to mission.its not that hard, just use common sense and don't autopilot. people make low sec out to be something way scarier than it actually is. sure there are camps, but there are only a few low sec spots that are permanantly camped, so just ask in militia or corp if anyone knows what those are and just avoid them."
"the priority of the status filtering of the overview seems a bit insane, to put it bluntly.there's options to filter based on standings, based on security status, based on bounties, based on corp and alliance, and based on wardecs, but in order to actually get the proper things to set up, you have to mess around with the various filters until something actually shows up properly.clicking to show wardecs but not show anything else causes no ships to be shown, because the overview filter decides that wardecs that are neutral standing, bad standing, bad status, or whatnot are not to be included in a wardec setting. in order to get wardecs to show up, you also have to show the other categories that might be included with wardecs, causing more than just wardecs to show up on your overview, effectively rendering the filter useless.and of course, there's no way to actually test you have the settings right until you have a wardec on grid, and if it doesn't show initially, you're probably going to be too busy to play with the settings until they do show up.so what i propose is the following, a change in the priority of overview status filterings:*most important*wardecsnegative standingfleetcorporationalliancenegative securityneutralpositive standing*least important*this way you can customize what items show up on your overview better than before, allow for an easier method to spot wardecs in the areas where it's important, those groups that are probably hostile to you but cannot shoot you safely in highsec next, and so on and so forth."
"is there a list of what the status is on the topics in this list?epecially the ones with: issues that win the csm vote and will be presented to ccpi also have some suggestions and questions about the topics, where should i post this? should i just reply to the topic behind the link in the list?thnx in advance"
"the ones that won are going to iceland this weekend - the first of the csm reps should land within 48 hours. as for where you should post your questions, that'd depend on the question. depending on what it is, i'd say either in the original thread on the topic or the jita park meeting thread that took it up(one of meeting #2, 3 or 5), or if it's a question about topics in general then serenity's thread should do."
"over the 3 weeks of pre-iceland talks we have successfully tabled from community discussions the following issues for face to face conference with ccp: 1. removal of 30/90 day time cards2. jump bridges and cyno-jammers fix3. log server exploitation/bacon.4. skill queue functionality? 5. 5% rule is too strict. 6. kill rights should be transferable. 7. alliances in faction warfare. 8. funky pos alterations. 9. improve black ops. 10. make suicide ganking more difficult11. general eve forums improvement/fixing12. csm should vote for its own chairman 13. evaluation of empire war dec mechanics14. feasibility of outposts going boom15. replace double-click in a chat channel16. cargo hold size of ships in hanger but not in use17. re-examination of 0.0 sovereignty 18. reload all ammo 19. small freighters20. drone implants 21. rigged ships and cargo22. aggression timer is too short/variable hull fix23. improve bombs 24. chat channel pilot listing25. ew icons26. hud minimum sizes27. personal assets hud28. skills page improvement29. assembly arrays 30. experimental industry issues31. science pos improvements32. sell order tweaks33. shares stock market34. contracts improvements35. completion of unfinished story arcs in eve36. roleplay interests in eve / dynamic consquence37. moon mining improvement / dynamic seeding38. pvp ownership of wrecks39. corporation standings slots 40. corporations automatical get alliance standings41. buff large autocannons42. colorblind ui43. account security 44. mac/linux client45. multi monitor support46. evemail spam from corp events.each of these issues stood for the mandated 7 days of public discussion. each was brought up in a formal quorate csm meeting and received a passing vote. each has been ruled an issue of importance and general community interest and has been documented in the form of a submission template and provided in advance to ccp to form the agenda for the conference in iceland. hope this helps!"

"i wonder how it would effect the economics of the game...i would love this if i were a pirate just because i'd be getting alot of free stuff, but it would send price's sky high due to the main supply of just about anything is jita.it would be moved from jita but i'd expect the market to go sky high for about a couple of monthsto tell you the truth i wouldn't want to pay 60 mil just a new harbenger"
"yes, yes it would thank you for bumping and pointing out the advantages. tbh i'd just like to see all the little rats trying to get off the sinking ship."
"id go for this either that or the low sec that will scare carebears."
"we have seen in the past few weeks a lot of problems with the current implementation of the council of stellar management. it is my belief that many of these problems can be fixed by allowing the csm to establish a system of rules for how their meetings are run. many of the problems with the csm simply come from the fact that it is not defined well enough at this point for their meetings to run smoothly, this combined with the fact that meetings must be held in eve chat makes what should be a simple process cumbersome and painful. proposed: that ccp revise the csm's governing document so that they can establish a system of rules and procedure for the conduct of their meetings and a method of enforcement. this will not only prevent from the chair running roughshod over its members but also set a system that will discourage personal arguments from making it onto the floor of the csm."

"um, the chair was the one with the most votes, and not lack of bias, amirite?if most of eve hate people for not being them, doesn't it fit that's exactly the representation being displayed? :pyou removed bits of smack against jade, hrm. if somebody smacks and gets smacked, guess what, that's good. what's not good is posting your propagandist bs in a forum meant for their communication, not yours.everyone (but anyone lacking higher brain function apparently) knows this whole csm bunk isn't meant to do anything. it's ccps little mindgame within a mindgame called eve.cheers,"
"well, its not as bad as having two members in the counsil who are clearly biased against ccp...joke aside, having clear oppininons, even of each other, are a normal part of politics, so i condone it fully.what the cms is lacking is the usual rules for exchange of opninions that most elected bodies have. rules that allows you to speak your mind on topics during sessions, but prevent you from making personal attacks and in other ways derailing the procedings, including dragging everything to a standstill by debating everything at infinitum."
"like most politics in real life, too often the most vocal are mainly interested in only hearing their own voices. seems like ccp and eve-online have found yet another way to assist in making eve-online mirror aspects of life.parliamentary rules sound like an excellent suggestion. but mainly i hope we voters learn from this so that when a second council is chosen, we will better understand what we may end up getting.and, perhaps rather than assuming that the most votes means chairman, someone from ccp chair the sessions (non voting) - until such time that the council have had the time to select their own chairperson from within the group.well, be back in a week to see if anything constructive has been approached.ccp : thanks for the oppurtunity to fail - as well as succeed.and to anyone else who follows the csm with even mild interest. remember the start, evaluate the finish, and see how you could better vote next time."
"ya know this kind of straight talking is what people have been begging today's rl politicians for....seems like batwigg is unhappy he didn't get some beat-round-the-bush politician bs spiel."
"funny thing about \"straight-taking politicians\" is the way they make certain loud minorities weep bitter tears when they get told what the politician actually thinks."
"i agree with you here actually. the role of chair would be better handled by some kind of non-voting ccp-employee in my opinion. since all the csm reps (myself included) have our own votes and interest and aspirations for the game then it sits poorly to have the chair combined with a voting position. still, i've tried to address this concern in meetings 4/5 by calling the other reps to do the introduction, debate moderation, call to vote on their own issues and i've only stepped in when asked to by the leading involved rep.i'd invite your to compare and contrast the stormy meeting 3with the far smoother and less arguementative meeting 4 and meeting 5and while speaking of \"constructive outcomes\" i'd remind you that over the 3 weeks of pre-iceland talks we have successfully tabled from community discussions the following issues for face to face conference with ccp: 1. removal of 30/90 day time cards2. jump bridges and cyno-jammers fix3. log server exploitation/bacon.4. skill queue functionality? 5. 5% rule is too strict. 6. kill rights should be transferable. 7. alliances in faction warfare. 8. funky pos alterations. 9. improve black ops. 10. make suicide ganking more difficult11. general eve forums improvement/fixing12. csm should vote for its own chairman 13. evaluation of empire war dec mechanics14. feasibility of outposts going boom15. replace double-click in a chat channel16. cargo hold size of ships in hanger but not in use17. re-examination of 0.0 sovereignty 18. reload all ammo 19. small freighters20. drone implants 21. rigged ships and cargo22. aggression timer is too short/variable hull fix23. improve bombs 24. chat channel pilot listing25. ew icons26. hud minimum sizes27. personal assets hud28. skills page improvement29. assembly arrays 30. experimental industry issues31. science pos improvements32. sell order tweaks33. shares stock market34. contracts improvements35. completion of unfinished story arcs in eve36. roleplay interests in eve / dynamic consquence37. moon mining improvement / dynamic seeding38. pvp ownership of wrecks39. corporation standings slots 40. corporations automatical get alliance standings41. buff large autocannons42. colorblind ui43. account security 44. mac/linux client45. multi monitor support46. evemail spam from corp events.each of these issues stood for the mandated 7 days of public discussion. each was brought up in a formal quorate csm meeting and received a passing vote. each has been ruled an issue of importance and general community interest and has been documented in the form of a submission template and provided in advance to ccp to form the agenda for the conference in iceland. now if anybody still holds that a few sparks and arguments in the debating chamber and some froth on the forums invalidates the good work done by csm representatives who have worked pretty damn hard to get this thing on the road to a ridiculously short timescale then there's not much i can say to that besides - run next time and show us you can do better. because i happen to think this inaugural csm has done a damn fine job. and anybody continuing to snipe from the sidelines in the face of very clear evidence of accomplishment is being petty, disingenuous and mindlessly vindictive."
"why exactly are you bothering to respond to jade's alt's attempt to troll with rl politics? anyone who actually believes what jade (illaria ) believes will never see reason. just ignore the rl stuff or take it to another forum.edit 1 = fixed quote bracketsedit 2 = got rid of rl political reference of my own. this is the wrong place for it."
"cleaned.please keep real life politics off the forums."
"i suppose we deserved that, but still,"
"if it was clearly a problem more people would support it was your claim. the counter argument to that was \"if that was true then we would see more support for issues such as email logging which affect a larger and more powerful userbase.\" that is, since we aren't your claim is false, whether or not its clearly a problem has little to do with the amount of support it gets. an objective unit of measurement obtained by examining the issue so that you are no longer unfamiliar with ityou might want to note that i would not have supported escalating this to ccp. it is not the result i am criticizing its the process."
"so you don't like the process... ok. v0v have a t-shirt made. nobody else likes it either. it's on the agenda for iceland to discuss. regarding support, you can't hold the council accountable for the disinterest in the playerbase in solving these issues. if they don't use the forum to support the issues then the forum will be useless. you can lead a horse to water... that doesn't make my claim of support any less valid. i'm telling you that if you want attention paid to something to drum up support for it. you're saying the lack thereof isn't indicative of whether or not there's a problem. i agree with that but am saying that if you want attention paid to something that's the way to do it."
"goum get back in line, you're ruining the whole conspiracy"
"maybe i am not being clear. the process of how you are making the decision to vote no. if you don't think the issue warrants being sent to ccp, fine. if you don't learn about the issue before the vote, not fine."
"a month of weirdness... i find myself agreeing with goonsdarius,i think what goumindong is saying is that csm members who are not informed on an issue should not vote \"no\" but abstain... if you do vote (yes or no) it should be done with a reason, not a \"i have no idea so i voted...\" an example would be \"i voted no on that because i did not think we should be worrying about individual ships when whole classes of ships have issues.\"then again, i could be wrong."
"i got the impression from the chatlogs that the csm had word from ccp about abstaining, suggesting that it requires 5 \"support escalation\" votes to move an issue forward, and that an abstention is the same as a no vote because of that. is that true?"
"that's only a technical difference though, one could always wait until everyone who cares has voted and then vote with the majority."
"yep there wasn't supposed to be an abstain option. bottom line is nobody who was running for the position of csm should really be abstaining on gameplay issues - our homework for the meetings is the read the threads, talk to players, understand the argument and reach an informed decision. i've certainly had multiple convo's open during some of these votes and been taking external advice on the technicalities - i'm doing my best to cast an informed \"support/deny\" vote based on what i perceive to the be the best interest of the game."
"support everything and make ccp cry about how many topics their are. really if you don't know about the topic just support it so that they can discuss it and hear ccp's opinion."
"that's true, they could do that - but i agree with jade that if you're elected to the csm you should do some research and talk to people in order to gain an informed opinion, not abstain. i think people abstaining from votes are not doing their jobs."
"agreed, still abstaining would seem like the lesser evil than generally voting no under such circumstances."
"well if a csm really cannot get enough understanding of an issue to put their name with conscience behind a support vote it doesn't necessarily mean they are stupid or failing - it could mean the issue is not well stated or is confusingly argued - in these cases voting \"no support\" can mean \"sorry but i'm not convinced\" and thats fair enough in the process."
"wouldn't it make more sense to vote for it right now so you can have a discussion in iceland about it and hopefully have your questions answered?"
"i don't understand what you are asking there yorda?if people don't agree/understand the proposition on the table they can't really vote \"support\"."
"if people don't understand the issue[not proposition, issue] maybe they should get informed?i mean, god forbid we have a place on the forums where that can happen, or a time for when csms can ask questions..."
"the whole point of the votes right now is to decide what you discuss with ccp, if the issue really is so complex that you cant understand it don't you think that having a face to face discussion with the person presenting it and ccp would maybe clear up some of the issues?"
"that was exactly why i said i voted down the issue. the issue of getting more support for a topic was secondary."
"well its actually about which questions we ask ccp. we are supposed to frame these things in the term of questions in our documentation. for example my \"destructible outposts\" thing actually boiled down to \"hey ccp can you envisage a future for 0.0 space that includes destructible outposts?\" (yes/no) the csm voted to support me asking that question.problem with some issues (particularly the capital ships online one) was that it was very specific on some of the proposed solutions and had stuff like fixing captial ship proliferation by reducing skill reqs and that really wasn't very persuasive. i certainly didn't find any single issue that got raised that i couldn't cast an informed vote on. but there were issues that i found poorly framed or badly argued or simply unconvincing and i had to vote \"no support\" with my conscience. end of the day we do have a responsibility to decide the priority of issues being raised and can't simply blanket support all of them and leave it for ccp to sort out or else whats the point of the csm itself? i'd be happy to see capital issues come up again certainly, but i'd like to see each distinct proposal split into a separate issue and fully argued and described so we can vote support/no support on an informed and decisive basis."
"actually we voted for the csm to have a discussion with ccp regarding the issue. at least that was my intention in voting yes. that in no way implies support for the subject matter, merely support for the conversation. we're not going to fill 2 or 3 days with yes's and no's. there will be back and forth or we will have wasted a significant amount of everyone's time."
"am i missing something? voting on issues to have a discussion with ccp about them? it'd be good if someone can point out where this is the stated purpose of the csm...i must have missed it in my readings...i really hope that the csm will one day split issues out into seperate issues for the purpose of making issues crystal clear, having a well-framed question, and making discussion and voting easier and meaningful (ie, each issue is voted on its merits/concerns). additionally, when will the csm start to take the 'benefits to the majority of eve players' into account when discussing and voting on issues.40 supports counts as an issue concerning the majority of eve players?representatives are free to bring up anything in a meeting, so long as it has been on the forum for a period of 7 days...submission templates before meetings hinder this process...when will csm members (with the exception of a couple) start to interact with the populace via the forums and actually debate/discuss issues that are posted? it seems to me that many csm reps are uninformed about issues and the implications of changes due to not asking questions of the issue and digging a little deeper. many simply stick an issue up, make zero further contribution and then bring it up for vote...obviously with a pre-determined opinion on the issue.i've certainly had multiple convo's open during some of these votes and been taking external advice on the technicalities - i'm doing my best to cast an informed \"support/deny\" vote based on what i perceive to the be the best interest of the game.maybe this would be better before a meeting? at least you are trying to understand some issues!when will we see discussion about issues, and their ramifications, in meetings? when will we see voting on an issue occurring, rather than voting just to make a list look bigger?take care,bruce hansen"
"actually the stated purpose of the csm was to serve as an oversight committee. beyond that our role has been altered to one of taking player issues directly to ccp with the guarantee of a response from them.if you'd prefer we do that without discussion that's just fine by me, but i fear we may not accomplish much.re: debate/discussion of issues. i involve myself minimally with the issues i'm most familiar with in various locations. i fail to see how my input would be any more relevant than your input on a subject with which you are more familiar. to top that off the assembly hall sucks for this purpose.sorry have to run for a conference call. i'll come back."
"re: capital ships online.this one was a bit of a jaw dropper for me. it looked like bane wanted to bring the topic in its unspecified totality to ccp for discussion. he indicated he had some specific ideas on how to nerf them or make them more accessable and he also had some ideas he hadn't presented. i mean......come on......let's talk about capital ships? you may as well say, \"let's talk about outposts\" or \"let's talk about battleships\" or \"let's talk about the amarr\", etc. it's too large a topic to not break down into specific proposals for a vote.unless i was missing something, voting aye on that proposal would have given bane carte blanche to present anything he wanted to ccp regarding changes to capital ships and mechanisms which control them without having the specifics of the presentation reviewed by the csm. at the very least he was asking the csm to vote on documents that weren't available to them at the time of the vote.at this point i won't suggest that bane was trying to pull something. i'm not convinced he was. i will, however, say this needed to be presented in a more organized manner and broken down into specific proposals. for that reason alone it was appropriately voted down.then posts on the forum which suggest the csm should have voted to escalate it because it's \"an important issue\". there was even one poster who suggested that those who voted against escalation of banes proposal were uniformed about it, should have been informed about it and had no business voting against something they didn't understand. what colossal conceit. some of what bane was suggesting in the csm meeting wasn't even on the forum thread he started on the subject i.e. shortening the skill training necessary to pilot a capital wasn't in the op of the thread.looking at the op of banes thread"
"i've already addressed that in this very thread."
"that's nice, but he hasn't posted the last one, let alone this one. i guess we're switching to jericho fraction's site for the csm stuff now. and, yeah, ccp haven't posted the first meeting minutes yet. everyone dropping the ball all over the place."
"well complain about it or say \"thanks\" to the people trying to do their best in trying circumstances. this really ain't an easy task and despite that we've pretty much done the thing as well as it could possible be done. keep in mind serenity had no formal responsibility to do this - he set up the eve.csm site (and our mailing list) because he wanted to make the csm a success not because he was obligated too. he could have sat back and watched ccp not get the resources in place in time and watch us fail to achieve much but no, he gave it a go and tried his best. thats what i'm doing by hosting these chatlogs on the jericho fraction site. i could sit back and not publish the logs but i'm trying to do the best i can to keep the promises we collectively made as the csm.sheesh."
"so we enter the age of wow...i miss the political threadsi miss people acutally replying without just trying to make a laughable comment to boost there egoreading this section just reminds me of what it looks like on a wow board. can we all act like adults or at least rp one.. i think more mod work needs to be done to put a end to the personal rubbish that is going on in here . the csm have been chosen. so let them do there best without all the posts having a go. flame me all you want..if you were part of the old days you will agree.. lets just try improve the forums for all our sake"
"it seems we are in no shortage of whines, though. i'm sure we could export our surplus to the wow forums."
"though you know i agree with you in spirit purgatori: eve has certainly lost its way when it comes to adult discussion on these forums - there is a big problem with more moderation and thats that it does come with inevitable bias in one form or another that can become its own evil. lets say for example that we had volunteer mods back and they were obliged to investigate and take action when x number of forum posters complained and anything. well in the current environment the same 160 odd posters who mindlessly flamed \"ban jade from the chair\" on the assembly hall thread could just as easily spam the moderation team and call for a perma-ban on my (or anyone else's) posting they didn't agree with just because they felt like being disruptive asses. you open a big can of worms when you throw open any kind of \"public\" opinion function in this environment where there is a loud bullying minority prepared to go the extra mile to get its way through mob voting.what we really need (in my opinion) is improved forum functionality with the ability to block posters, corps or even alliances, that we personally feel bring no value to our forum experience. there is no reason that everyone should be forced to read the almost uniformly awful posting of particular people or entities. some people hate my posting purgatori and loathe anything the star fraction writes - let them block me and it and never have to worry about flaming us again.and i'm not convinced its actually even possible for ccp to moderate these forums successfully at the moment given the fact that the games largest single alliance is a professional forum-trolling outfit of epic scope and obsessional enthusiasm for this dark \"art\" and without banning that entity from the game wholesale (which they obviously aren't every going to do since it = 50,000 dollars a month+) they (and we) need to live with a certain level of disruptive and abusive bullying flaming and trolling as a background noise since this sort of behaviour is the lifeblood and passion of this particular in-game entity. solution is - give us forum block tools and give us a better suite of in-game block tools. let the abusive flamers keep flaming and use their 50,000 dollars a month to improve the game for the rest of us while we can opt out of reading their nonsense and just stick to shooting their ships in game. its a fairly elegant solution"
"wouldn't \"professional forum-trolling outfit\" imply that we get paid to do this? if so i'm missing a few paychecks.i guess my posting doesn't really count as trolling though..."
"thank you for the reply . and yes i had to \"whine\" because i being a played since day one i left the forums because i felt they went to a point where each thread was a flame or troll.then i thought.. why am i leaving the forums to which i enjoyed because of other people. so hence my thread.i love to see some one who can take the time to write a good post and yes some one like jade. the times where jade was a political mastermind was great days. and i always await a good teaser by sirmolle even though he is my arch enemy from the days of venal alliance. i semi agree with the function to be able to ignore people. would solve the fact i would not have to read the \"junk\" but then part of me thinks other things could be done . for me,eve is more then roam and attack pos warfare. its the politics that made eve. so this is purgatori aka tankuk comming back to the forums to once again join in with the banter, even if i disagree with some of you"
"the funny thing is i actually do know people who are paid \"forum trolls\" and you can get employed to do this stuff at the darker edge of the political lobbyist profession. i guess you should have a word with your corp ceo's yorda - maybe consider going on strike if they don't review your terms and conditions?"
"its me, i'm the goon secret agent in the op. i hold the rank of grand marshal of the forum brigade. i could tell you but i'd have to troll you...wait.seriously though, it warms my heart that jade has to whine about \"us\", us being those who posted in the aforementioned thread, everywhere and every way he can. i think its clear who it is that has the vendetta."
"yeah but you need to think about the consequences really - just consider \"whats the worst most abusive thing that a mob of 5000 players could do with this change?\" and then ask yourself if its still a good idea. definitely and i have very high hopes that faction warfare is going to save this part of eve really - what i've seen so far is excellent, opportunity and dynamism, news reportage and systems changing hands. now we need to lobby ccp to take account of this stuff in upcoming plotlines and look at exporting the successful fw mechanics to 0.0 and involving the pirate factions out there. since the 0.0 arena has almost completely failed to provide interesting ic politics and incident these last couple of years yes, we do need to look at some radical alternatives to drive the story of eve online. welcome back!"

"i've proposed a simple flexible constitution for the council of stellar management based on the csm.pdf. as of yet, it has only attracted the attention of responces such as \"too much thinking required, not enough crazy emotional reponse!!!one!1!.\"unfortunately most people are under the impression that the csm.pdf is itself a founding document, and not a buisiness proposal internal to ccp."
"i am wondering why there is nothing posted in the proclamations forum. you could just paste all the meeting topics, results, logs, minutes and source links as threads there. just keep a mod handy for locking the threads once finished.it'd be a much more clear display of what's going on instead of having threads randomly floating around the jita park forum. of course having duplicate threads around here for open discussion is also needed.so, good idea or what's going on?"
"we haven't yet been told whats going on here. its a subject for iceland i guess. and yes, i'd definitely like to be able to post the meeting agenda topics and not have them immediately filled by froth and off-topic rubbish - would be nice"

"what constitution? this csm.pdf is not a constitution or any other form of founding document. that is a buisiness proposal explaining why its a good idea for ccp to encourage the formation of a player government, and only in very general terms what kind should be encouraged.this is a constitution constitution for the council of stellar management."

"i agree minmatar caps need some fixing.however, the dread is an armor tanker no? what it needs is an extra low, and one less mid. also split weapon bonuses suck in general.also its lunacy for having the mothership break the mold and be a shield tanker, so much extra training ontop of extra training.directly compairing the thanatos to the nid, well its insane the crappyness of the nid with the ops earlier comparasons.heck give the nag, the choice of 3/3 turrets/launchers, one less high and one more low, let the player pick launchers or turrets for it, and that way they can stick in a damage mod in that low and they are all set.and somehow fix the nid, its just poo."
"i voted yes but i agree with your point of view. minmatar capitals should remain the weakest but the skills needed for them shoudl be diminished. so for naglfar for example maybe give them 3 turrets slots with the appropriate bonuses so that the base damage remains what it is with todays 2+2 or even somewhat less than the base damage of todays *by base damage i mean the damage it does without any weapon upgrade mods installed.*"
"if you want an idea of just how terrible the naglfar is, a naglfar with five officer damage mods does less damage than a revelation with 3 t2 damage mods and the lowest type of faction ammo.("
"tbh alot of the suggestions don't go far enough. i think ++damage is the way to balance this ship- put the \"cannon\" back into \"glass cannon\" so to say.without changing any slots or bonuses, just upping to 4 turret hardpoints(retaining option to fit 2 launchers though, and the launcher bonus if you like) with no other changes, would go a long way towards putting the damage type and quantity(with a couple of gyros)in the right ballpark."
"imo:4 highs, 3 turrets, 0 missiles6 mids6 lows7.5% capital projectile rof, 5% capital projectile damagebang! you have a big tempest, that can do light tank shield tank + high dps, or armor tank + comparable dps to the other dreads. even with this considerable bonus, capital projectiles may need a small boost to bring them in line with the other dreads.also capital autocannons really need to be looked at, as fighting in falloff isn't really a considerable tactic when your primary purpose is to be anchored in one place due to siege, therefore the high paper dps of capital autos means nothing because you will at least be fighting at some range."

"coming up with a new ship type just to create a tech 2 version of a hull that hasn't been used yet usually ends badly. but this is a good idea.supported, but i'd like to see them differentiated from cruiser sized logistics in some way other than size."
"i support this idea even though i don't think ccp will get the idea of what people actually want!i was thinking that an anti-drone frig would be a good idea. a really fast ship with very high tracking speed bonuses but putting out less damage than a normal frig.i donno, just an idea."
"a logistics frigate is a good idea but id like to take and do a different type of logistics support role. since youve already got the cruiser sized \"medics\" i suggest you make the frigate version one that gives bonuses to various types of support not currently being bonused or being so but not used very often by any other ship such as remote sensor boosting, projected eccm, tracking link, target painting. make them essentially a little \"buff\" mobile. it would give these forgotten frigs a role not filled by any other and maybe bring to use mods that arnt widly used atm."
"have you ever flown one? my corp flies them in duo's and they can soak up massive amounts of damage that way.fc's have to decide whether to put their firepower onto 1 of them while having their fleet size reduced or trying to simply outdamage the repair amount of both of them.a logistics frig would help in roaming gangs as currently cruisers defenitly lack when it comes to keeping frigates in shape.especially armor repairers have the problem that by the time you lock your target and have gone throu a cycle it is already gone. the use of maintenance drones doesn't help much either as usaly the frigates are simply too fast for them.logistics frigates with a decent bonus to repair range and a reduction in repper duration could provide effective repairs to frigates."
"yer, me wants - but three high slots to run a small nos as well as reps."
"no, but i'll be skilled into them in about two weeks. and my first comment was a bit dismissive - in small gangs they're just fine(see the alliance tournaments, for the most obvious example), but every account i've heard from people who use them is that once you get circa 20 on the opposing side, logistics cruisers just pop instantly. this is apparently why carriers get used for remote rep in fleets - they have the hp to take some hammering, even if they're less efficient in most senses of the word. i admit, this is second-hand, but it fits well with what i know of how everything works. but that said, how long could a logistics frigate survive even against a small gang? rare is the frigate with more than a few thousand ehp, and it doesn't take much to pop that. you might keep frigates in shape a bit better, but your logistics ships will pop any time somebody breathes on them hard."

"you cant fit 6x t2 1400s on a tempest. that screams broken.then you need 2x sensor boosters to lock as far as the tremor can hit, and another two tracking enhancers/comps to hit about 140 optimal. then if you want gyros ontop of that, along with a fitting mod, well you have no tank, and the tracking is entirely awful with tremor, only able to hit stationary battleships."

"[no support]brainless bimbo, thanks for sticking with this thread arguing against the op.about alternate bpos - the example of being able to make a ship out of other materials.... no. there is a reason that it takes much more tritanium. read the description, from what i recall it goes something like \"basic building block of all items\".lets say an airplane takes 1000 units of aluminum (hull) 100 units of copper (wiring) and 10 units of silicon (electronics). there are analogous examples in game. it makes no sense to allow us to make an airplane out of 1000 units of silicon or copper - there are different minerals for a reason.if you don't get that example, try this one. i'm making bread. it takes 100 units of flour (trit) and 5 units of yeast, sugar, etc. (other minerals). it would be impossible for me to make this item with any other combination or ratio - it wouldnt be bread, it would be matza - and that's gross.you may be right about moon mining (not my area of expertise ), but it makes no sense to change bpo mineral requirements or roid availability. oh and why is veldspar expensive? because even though it's everywhere, a disproportional number of people enjoy sitting in their big mining ships driving down the prices. so be glad you understand economics and make profit off veld."
"thanking somebody who has no clue what they're talking about and sticking around spreading misinformation ?great... right, so now we go by description and backstory when deciding game balance issues ? if you like to take this particular route, then how about you read the description on veldspar, scordite and a couple other ores around ?\"the most common ore type in the known world, veldspar can be found most everywhere. it is still in constant supply as it holds a large portion of the much-used tritanium mineral.\"all it says is that it's abundant as heck yet still needed. nothing about being valuable or anything.\"pyroxeres is an interesting ore type, as it is very plain in most respects except one - deep core refining yields a little bit of nocxium, increasing its value considerbly[...]\"hmm, somebody should call them and tell them pyroxeres is not even as valuable as poor common veldspar.\"spodumain is amongst the most valuable ore types around[...]\"whoopsies, another such mistake. nope, sorry, it's not even close to being one of the most valuable ones nowadays.\"arkonor. the rarest and most sought-after ore in the known world. a sizable nugget of this can sweep anyone from rags to riches in no time.\"hmm. right. a nugget to get you from rags to riches you say ? if the x16 income level would have held true, maybe.but hardly the case anymore when mining arkonor wherever you can find it barely brings you at best five times (or actually less pending refine taxes and such) the income of veldspar in a nice little highsec hub.funny you should say that, because in the old days, airplanes were made out of a little bit of wire but mostly wood, cloth, paper and varnish. also, not all planes of today are made out of various aluminum alloys, but some others out of mostly carbon fiberglass, for instance.and that flour could be whole wheat flour, could be a flour made out of various other cereals, or could even be whole maize flour. what do you know, it's still bread, even if the main ingredient used is something completely different. i mean, you can't claim whole wheat bread is the same as cornbread, can you ? but it's still bread, nevertheless, isn't it ?for the i have no idea how many-eth time, *i* don't mine, *i* personally, for my own interests couldn't care less if mining in highsec was more valuable than mining in 0.0 and so on and so forth.but the fact that mining in highsec is equally valuable to mining in lowsec (since the common \"best earner\" is still veldspar) even if the game was designed in such a way as to have lowsec be more attractive than highsec mining-wise, that's obviously wrong for a whole different set of reasons."
"lol akita t.....decriptions in game are not very good are they, but they don't mention what profit you expect to derive they just set a relative value, all the descriptions of ore are on a per unit basis as well, so one unit of ankonor is much more valuable than 1 unit of veldspar, can't you understand that?umm lets look at those aeroplanes, make em out of wood and wire and they go how fast?, 160 mph, make them out of alloy and they go what, 1200 mph, apples and oranges, your saying a noob frigate is make out of the same stuff a battle ship. haha on the bread, but its really bread with different qualities and uses, just like different frigates do different tasks.look akita t i know nothing about you apart from you don't actually have the ability to comprehend/understand concepts in the written form well enough to apply criticial thinking. you try to divert attention from where your argument gets soundly beaten with your use of countless straw men arguments and anlogies, you seem to get thumbs up from characters with less than 15 posts as well which leads me to beleive that your trying to manipluate the discussion and drive your idea through.you do some good stuff like in the noob section with the golden rules, the collection of do/don't points, but they are not your original thinking they are a collection of others work that you happily take credit for because you desire forum credability.

"just accept it, no matter how i put the problem, no matter how you turn it from how i put it, there's no satisfying you... you're just dead-set on me being wrong regardless of any kind of evidence or inference.regardless of anything else you can say about it, it all comes down to this easy thing for you to comprehend... yet keep on failing, repeatedly : highsec mining is supposed to be the least profitable, lowsec mining more profitable, and 0.0 mining the most profitable.yes, supposed to. says who ? everybody but you and those who share your namesake."
"as a lowsec miner, i fully agree with this message and/or servicethe only way to make more money in lowsec than in highsec is to find hidden belts, which are very rare, and not really all that rewarding"
"as ccp are pvp ppl the risk and reward factors seem to be originally based more on strength and occurance of npc rats, thats where the security rating comes from, roid types were placed to reflect the fact and thier mineral content too, concord was added later like insurance to add a degree of player protection where life was easier. as to your supposition that high sec mining should not be as or more profitable than nul sec i have to disagree. the skills required to strip mine efficiently in a hulk are the same no matter what ore you mine is it not.if you do not want players who are efficient miners and ore processors and who do make lots of cash on veldspar then you have to tackle lvl 3 and 4 mission runners in high sec also because they get great rewards in battleships which are basically the same grade of ship as a hulk in skill points required to fly.(removes foot from mouth}ccp knows that veldspar is the most needed ore as a source of trit, thats why its in nul sec too, they removed shuttles as it was trit on tap, open to abuse, a cap on the market, without that cap the price begins to reflect demand and miners will mine it to give a supply, therefore all your moaning about is too many miners in low sec mining high end roids (low price) and not enough ppl mining veld in high sec, low sec and nul sec (high price)."
"low sec has much greater risks than high sec. even if it is only the time it takes to fit out another suicide gank ship the ganker has still used more resources than the low sec guy simply blowing you up. rats in low sec get harder requiring stiffer tanks. rats in null sec can get very extreme requiring very expensive tanks. the same argument about risk versus rewards being broken could be used to justify bs rats in 1.0. i don't want price caps. simply that 0.0 by virtue of being 0.0 should have better roids. individual min prices should not matter in this. the ore itself should be superior. the entire reason arkonor is 0.0 only is because it was supposedly already mined out buy the empires in empire space. the same would hold true for teh best veld roids."
"so why are you still mining in lowsec? this isn't snark, it's a serious question."
"you make it sound as if you even might be right.no, it's not a supposition, it's a fact. it's been repeated over and over again as a cornerstone of the game since the game started, and the only reason you don't keep seeing it repeated is because the devs don't say all that much lately, and when they do say anything, they try out of all possible angles to say as little as possible.the idea that you can even begin to ignore that is nearly unfathomable, so deeply wrong that it's no wonder people start calling you troll.yes, ther are a lot of other things that are too profitable in highsec and not enough more profitable in lowsec/0.0, but the mining/ores are just one of those things, and the one that has been targeted by this thread.yes, the rest will have to be fixed too, eventually, but it's not that much of a problem right now.saying that a lot of other things are \"sort of broken\" too with regards to highsec/lowsec/0.0 risk-vs-reward balance doesn't give you a shred of right to go against fixing one of the things that's broken.that you could even entertain such train of thought deems you worthy of your chosen name."
"i only mine hidden belts in lowsec, which are very, very rare, and usually only contain gneiss, which is about 2x veldspar valuethe rest of my time i spend mining velsdpar in a cargo expanded & rigged hulk in 1.0, which makes more isk/week than mining a very limited quantity of gneiss(you can usually mine out a hidden gneiss belt in under a day)"
"look the op argument is, not enuf trit available, make a get out of jail card so the limiting factor is done away with as ppl concentrate on activities that provide high end minerals so lets utilise them more.its not about risk reward in any way is it, its about a perceived limited supply of trit on the market, that is the sole gripe for alternate bpo's."
"/signed pilgrim is awful, u guys need to overlook it."
"take away the drone bonus and give it a range bonus its an easy fix. if you want damage fly a curse. its the same with caldari, whens the last time you saw a falcon do any dmg? besides youd still have a beasty drone bay and the amount of \"behind the scenes\" damage your doing can be immmense. make the dam ship a force recon, give it its ewar bonuses and take away its dmg. you want dmg? thats what combat recons are for. the idea is to balance the ship not make it a solo god. you guys have to remember that neuts = dmg to any active tank."

"as a nidhoggur pilot, i support this change."

"for pve the current precision heavies are very good. you can hit anything apart spider drones ii perhaps and do good damage. the diminished signature of the precision heavies helps much against the npc annoying frigates. while the supposed \"better\" precision cruise missiles have very big signature unable to deliver full damage even to npc cruisers. i know you have the pvp in mind but there are also pve needs. in pve the frigates never go faster than 880m/s so the current explosion velocity of the heavies at 1000 does matter. if an upgrade would be made that should be on cruise precision missiles by diminishing considerably their current signature radius while lowering their dps for more balance. but not lowering the signature and dps as low as are the current precision heavies. that would help against those sturdy tech 2 frigates in lvl 4 missions. initially i thought that perhaps it would be better if ccp creates additional missile types like \"precision mkii\" for example more inclined for pvp purposes.but then i realised that there is a reason there are these current missile limitations. don't forget that it not about a specific missile penalty in particular. actually everything is impossible to be hit when traveling very fast regardless of weapon platform be it turrets or missiles. at least missiles always hit at non mwd speeds regardless while the turrets keep failing. also missiles don't take into consideration your (caldari) ship's speed. for example a mwd moving turret boat can't hit much while orbiting with mwd on, while a missile ship can keep traveling ultra fast and always hit a supposed imobile target. (remember nano typhoons?)that is why i don't support this idea. not because i have this minmatar character. i happen to have another account that flies caldari. but it just dosn't seem good for game balance."
"i totally agree, we'd definitely need an explosion velocity boost for heavy missiles. atm. the majority of caldaris can't do much against nano ships. not many of us are trained in turrets, yet we are forced to use them, to do any damage at all at those nano-fleets, harassing the faction warfare battlegrounds (no, you can't web them, since they won't get into web range). precision light missiles don't have a sufficient range to fight the current nano-camps, precision heavy- and cruise missiles don't have the explosion velocity to hurt them. so an explosion velocity boost for heavies as proposed above might help a lot to do at least a little damage and not exclude the major weapontype of the biggest faction from fighting nano-ships."
"i don't have any experience with t2 missiles as i can't use them. but i've gone over your numbers and you make a strong point backed by fact. i just hope that ccp/the csm recognizes your hard work and works towards a steady fix for all t2 ammo, starting with the ones with the best factual corrections."
"i'd normally let blatant fail like this slide, but i can't afford to let some innocent hear something so blatantly wrong and believe it.spider drone i stats1) all caldari missioning ships have drone bays. drake for level 3s: drone bays. nighthawk, level 4s: drone bays. raven variants: large drone bays. the only heavy missile, non-drone bayed using caldari ship is the cerberus, which should never be used in a level 4, and would **** level 3s. why on earth would you waste missiles on a target like the spider drone?2) even if you did, for some godforsaken reason, need to use heavy missiles on this spider drone, your base explosion velocity, on plain-old t1 heavies, without skills, is higher than the drone's movement velocity. with level v tnp, its nearly 3 times higher than its actual orbit speed.3) if you read my post, you would know that the missile damage formula picks the worst case scenario, and disregards the other stat. given the drones 27mm signature radius, your heavy missiles will suffer *no* loss of damage to velocity, as your signature radius reduces it far more. that drone would have to break 1150m/s orbit before explosion velocity would take over in damage reduction.4) precision heavy missiles will go from 28.8% damage imparted to 48%. you will note, however, that i'm not proposing to change p-hm missile explosion radius, so you will see no change to your imaginary heavy missile level 4 mission runner's performance.5) i have no idea why your bringing cruise missiles into this. i listed all guidance stats for comparison purposes. precision cruise missiles are better in every way than precision heavy missiles. hell, cruise missiles would even out gank heavies on npc cruisers due to the massive damage increase, compared to the signature radius loss.6) turret ships actually can drive off orbiting nanohacs. obviously pimp 6kms+ nanohacs will be very hard to hit, and take a long time to run off. amazingly, 6kms is where the changed precision heavy missiles would start doing close to no damage. 1.83% damage before resists isn't exactly scary.7) finally, t2 ammo is, by and large, pvp ammo. marauders excepted, you can't afford to use it in pve, nor should you ever need it to begin with. saying \"don't fix precision heavy missiles, they are great for popping frigates my drones should be killing\" is possibly the stupidest thing i've ever heard proposed in earnest.to all other posters, thanks for the support."
"zaran: if you're shooting missiles at anything frigate sized and below, you're doing it wrong. use your drones. this is quite simply completely false. turrets don't care how fast you are going, only your transversal. it's easy for turrets to hit someone going fast if they are at an angle or distance where the transversal isn't very good."
"this thread, and the nighthawk one, illustrate the problem with getting the community to comment on caldari balance issues - too many people either assume that we're talking about pve, or tell us that the item is fine in pve, and therefore fine."
"it's hard to be caldari.ppeople assume that when you talk about missiles = pve and caldari pvp = ew"
"i've pretty much made up my mind that whoever runs for csm next time as a caldari pvp'er who understands pvp issues is going to get my vote. the \"but it's fine in pve\" defence gets old fast."
"1) as we all know when you arrive at the mission area there are several \"packs\" of enemies that act separatly as small groups. so you try to get the minimal aggro possible. you never engage the whole spawn.only just a small pack of enemies each time then proceed to the next. in most guristas missions the drones get agrroed from the packs you have not aggroed yet. the only way to keep your drones from geting agroo is to agrro the whole spawn therefore packs a b c d which is \"unprofessional\" . so i mostly use drones to break the tank of the bses faster. i can kill the t2 frigates using precision heavies much easier. usually a couple of salvoes will do it. i don't remember exaxctly how many salvos i need cause i haven't played a lvl 4 in drake for ages. it's a bit dull to play drake lvl 4s...anyway... the thing is that i take down frigates t1 and tech 2 much faster using only missiles. i got good drone skills with that caldari character but why use drones when i do it with heavies a lot faster? and much more conveniently for most guristas missions.for the same reason if i happen to play missions with zaran that flies apocalypse and maelstorm i try to pop the frigates from afar before they reach me (ab helps much in that) so that i save my drones from the aggro in guristas missions. i remember one case in a guristas mission using the maelstorm (without ab) that while i aggroed a pack of frigates i got jammed and by the time i was unjammed the frigates were orbiting near me. i had to use drones but they got aggroed by a pack of cruisers far away that was \"neutral\" so far. i managed to kill the frigates but when i was done i had lost about 7 light drones ii) and that is the problem with the drones in some guristas missions. thats why i prefer to use precision heavies when i can (if in drake) . 2) for the first moments they orbit very fast around you at 5000m/s !! gradually they orbit for less. in fact i don't remember very well that is why i mentioned it before that is why i said that [b]perhaps[b/] you can't hit spider drones ii with precision. i haven't been in a lvl 4 with a drake that contained spiders ii . with zaran i take them out with drones since zaran doesn't fly the drake) the problem is in their signature. spider drones have a signature of 25? maybe 20? if i hit them with missiles of 150signature i won't damage them much. the base 75signature of the precision heavies + the skills gets down to about 45 if i remember right so i could deal them some decent damage like that.3) yes but as i said the problem is in the signature of missiles in that case. explosion velocity is fine for pve. and the lessened signature counts as i mentioned in 2) 4) i just mentioned that about the missions in case you hadn't taken into consideration how nicely the current precision heavies work in missions and for the same reason how bad the precision cruiser missiles are for missions with their current large signature radius. probably you say that the precision cruiser missiles are great since in pvp with all these ships mwding the signature is not a problem even against interceptors. i ve never happened to use precision missiles in pvp so far due to th fact that when i was pvping (for razor) i had not the skills for tech 2 missiles yet.5) i bet that precision cruise missiles they do an overall good damage against cruiser ships for the reasons you said but they will be worthless against the frigates cause their base signature even with skills is too big to destroy the t2 frigates. that was my point. i perceived the mater from a pve scope not pvp. 6) perhaps i should have been more precise. lets take this example. ship a is a nano cruiser.ship b is a turret bs. ship c is a raven or a drake (non nano)1) ship a is orbiting ship b with mwd on. ship b fails to hit everytime. 2) ship a is orbiting ship b without mwd on but in close orbit . ship b depending on the weapon platform it uses may hit some \"light hit\" here and there but still keeps missing mostly.lets see what happens with ship c1) ship a is orbiting ship c with mwd on. ship c hits but for 0 damage everytime due to the missile penalties2) ship a is orbiting ship c without mwd on but in close orbit . here ship c will hit for big damage. see the advantage of missiles?so missiles will do big damage and always hit non mwded targets. turrets will fail to hit even non mwded targets if they orbit too close.and let's not forget the example of nano typhoon orbiting around and immobile blasterthron. the nano typhoon will kill the blasterthron because the missiles give it the advantage to move in mwd and hit. the opposite can't happen. see now the advantages of the missiles in pvp?"
"disregarding the fact that the topic is about pvp not pve i won't coment on the other points you made. but i see a deep sens of you not understanding the issue. first of all the bs ship attacking nano has a slight chance of hitting especialy if the nano pilot does sth wrong while the missile guy has non because speed = immunity to missiles. second did you read the op's post? i seriously doubt it. the main point of it was to bring the heavy precisions in line with light and cruise nothing more. and if missiles are so great in pvp why do i see mainly turret ships ? missiles have a lot of drawbacks in the world of nano and some advantages when ships with missiles are nanoed. but missile ships are mainly a caldari thing and caldari ships are not the fastest out there so giving us(the caldari) some slight compensation for not being able to compete for speed seems a good trade don't you think ?"
"a well-researched, well-rounded proposal. has my vote."
"agreed. excellent research. ~ dru"
"ughhh. a simple tiny fix draws this much of a troll?unless your in a well tanked turret ship, you don't start firing on frigates or cruisers. you kill the dps - either starting with the bs's, or any high dps bcs you can 1-2 volley. the very fact your seriouslly proposing starting a mission by using t2 ammo on frigates demonstrates you either 1) don't know how to play or 2) are trolling.actually, the stats page i linked you says they move 3kms. which matters not, as you still can't hit their 27mm signature radius effectively. thats why your ship has a drone bay.learn to use drones without using them. protip: you can ignore spider drones until the rest of the pocket is dead if you need to. if you are in danger of dying, and an elite frig has you warp disrupted, you don't really care if you loose a coule hobgoblin ii - they just saved your ship. this situation will never occur, except in cases of pilot error.your possibly the only person who uses a pvp based weapon in pve, then claims that horrible, broken stats are excused because you use them to kill spider drones, when 50,000isk worth of drones will do that for all time. its a pvp weapon. period, the end. ........that turret battlehip? the one that cannot hit you because your too close? he just hit you with a 90% web, and then a half second later alpha striked your cruiser. he also had a pack of drones on you, and really did not care in the slightest that you were close.a raven (and to lesser extent, typhoon) will either hit you for decent damage with cruise, or hit you with torpedos, which will have drastically reduced impact damage due to signature radius problems. neither one will demonstrate the raw destructive damage of 8 megapulse in your face, or 7 neutrons, etc.oh gawd, luls. nanophoons can't move fast enough to kite a 'thron to death. they aren't agile enough to begin with, and their absolute velocity is still lol. even in this imaginary world of yours, that nanophoon is shotting 4 cruise missiles (if you even begin to utter the word torpedo, that thron will 90% web you and **** your face off). thats not scaring anybody. thron either waits for backup, or deagresses jumps/docks. please, stop trolling in my thread. you either don't know what your talking about, or your some caldari hater. either way, please leave now."

"given that my ac iv, unrigged crow, does 6.3kms, and will orbit at 24km slightly below that, yes. the only interceptor that is reliably 4.5kms is the taranis. the 'ranis is not a tackler. it is a killer. it hunts targets of opportunity and hits them with some odd 150-200dps.every other interceptor can go at least 6.4kms unrigged. even better? depending on pilot skills, interceptors can be hit by pulse lasers even at very high speeds. 6.3kms is no guarantee of permatackling a harbinger. you've already made it clear, however, that you don't know how pvp works on the field. these changes to heavy missiles make them too slow to hit the vast majority of interceptors. those it can hit, would already be hit by any other reasonable turret weapon anyways, or be too slow to dodge the warrior iis."
"precision heavies as currently fired by a drake have a top speed of 4875 m/s/with the proposed boost, it will be 5625 m/s/outrunning either in an inty is trivial."

"assuming the mass of afs are changed to be in line with their t1 hulls, the only thing that will really diferentiate their velocity from the t1 versions will be their base speed. ass you can clearly see below, most af base speeds actualy below their t1 hulls speed, and the 2 that are faster than their t1 hull are only so by 5m/s. so if the af and t1 hull are spoting a comparable fit (both speed fit, or both fit to tank/gank, etc) then their speeds would be very close.merlin 230m/s -> harpy 225m/s, hawk 235m/spunisher 250m/s -> retri 240m/s, vengeance 235m/srifter 320m/s -> jaguar 325m/s, wolf 295m/stristan(*) 260m/s -> enyo 240m/s, ishkur 250m/s*gallente af stats are bassed off tristan, not icursus i agree that the dictor nerf was uncalled for.as for af's vs dictors, they fulfill entirely different roles. the primary purpose of a dictor (whether you like it or not) is to drop a bubble. not to say that dictors cant fulfill secondary roles aswell, but that is its primary role. the primary purpose of an af is (suposed to be) straight up combat in one form or another. as such, you really cant compare the two as you could afs versus other straight up combat ships.as for your next paragraph, the problem with you idea is that although afs may have a good sustainable tank, they have far less effective hit points than cruisers. because of this, they need to rely more on frigate elements of survival, such as speed tanking and manuverability. if they are slow and heavy, they can not do this and the wont last very long. i personaly am not against these \"role bonuses\" like web imnuity, but this thread is only about basic changes to mass and ship bonuses. lets not derail it too much in that direction."
"did you not read the note reguarding that example? that \"unbalanced ship\" is a typhoon fit only with a t2 mwd vs an af fit only with a t2 mwd. once you start speed fitting them both, the speed gap will widen even further.that leaves us with 2 possible culprits... either the phoon is broken in its current state, or the af is. as the only frigate sized ships the phoon is outpacing are afs, this leads me to believe that the problem is with the afs.with the exception of the jaguar, all of the proposed afs in the op will not be any competetion for intys in ways of speed or role. i do have a problem with the jags proposed 5% velocity bonus, and i believe i already voiced that concern in this thread and more thoroughly in the ops other thread in the features and ideas forum."
"while i would endorse any good af fix the problem is that it's way too easy to make af's severely overpowered. simply adding more slots and giving more bonuses would make them the ship of choice for just about anything."
"dont ruin my wolf please. i rather have current wolf than this wolf. oh and extra slots, but how about pg/cpu issues?"
"i kinda agree, though i'd like to point out that then af would become more like inties, only that inties would still be better, because with frigate hulls, speed tanking is your only option anyway."
"i like the actual wolf too, but i think the jaguar is more likely an ac platform than the wolf, i was thinking about turning it into a munin style, like the harpy, big alpha on this one.the added slots without a pg or cpu increase is what i think will balance a bit.but, im all open for suggestion, what do you think would be a better change to the minmatar line of afs?"
"pezzle has a wizard hat. it is perhaps what makes him the greatest thinker and most clearly spoken person in the eve universe, and most certainly these forums.if i were ccp, i would not only adopt this idea, but i would make mr. pezzle a consultant for future game changes regarding standings.the hat comes with him, so you get both a wise man and a wizard hat of mystical, magical powers.o/"

"full support. what is the space opera without bounty hunters? :)"
"going back to the idea of having a corp or office at concord then why not make a central concord base like in yulai and have a \"concord militia\" tab like factional warfare to allow for bounty hunters.if u make the cost requirements needed to kill sumone not worth while until sumone has a bounty of xxx amount then it would probs help reduce/stop peopel just placing 1 isk bounties to cause grief.if sumone has 1isk bounty and it costs the hunter 2mill to go out and kill said target they not going to bother, the only people who would ever do that is the sumone outrightly going to grief another player which i believe is petitionable.there shud be extra bounty hunter options appear once a player joind the concord bh militia and he will have access to specific locator agents far superior to standard player agents and he can buy an informant skill to get the location quicker.also as there is a militia channel then have bounty hunter channel for them too to discuss locations of bounties and form fleets to hunt a specific target and choose under the militia options to hunt as a pack and share the bounty between the nominated players."
"strong arguments.and i set another scenario.a player uses 2 accounts.account a is the pirate and account b is the bounty hunter.he goes with account a and makes the life of a miner very hard. the miner puts large bounty on the pirate.the player logs both accounts. and uses the bounty hunter of account b to kill the pirate of account a. so he makes money from the bounty of his victim. that is why i don't support this."
"it's not a bad idea, but none of these ideas prevent the following scenario:player a and b are friends.player c is annoyed enough with player a to put a substantial bounty on him.player d is a bounty hunter.player a sees the bounty given to him. he docks in a 0.0 or low sec system if they aren't in the same corp and just in high sec if they are and asks player b to come to him.player b pods player a and claims the bounty.player b sends the isk to player a.now did c instead of giving a some trouble worth for the isk paid, he gave him isk almost directly in his wallet. while player d, the bounty hunter, didn't even get a shot at the bounty.the threshold of making this tactic worthwhile is just 'one implant free clone'. which you can get by jump cloning so that's not a problem too and clones aren't all that expensive so the threshold is easily reached.personally i don't really see a fix to this problem because b can basicly do everything the 'legit' bounty hunter d can do aswell. the only difference being that b shares the isk with a and d wouldn't."
"and how is this different from the current implementation?a possible solution to your question would be to not allow the collecting of (player)bounties unless it is done by a concord approved/licensed bounty hunter and is done in high sec space. if the bounty is said to be escrowed through concord as all bounties are, then killing the player for the bounty in low or null sec would not be counted. a player would reclone with said bounty and it wouldn't be removed until claimed in high sec or the bounty had expired. does this then relegate a bountied player to low and null sec space? did a bounty in the wild west relegate a person to outlying territories?~ dru"
"i support the premise, the implementation needs work...perhaps if the bounty system required something, perhaps kill rights...miner a has his can flipped by ore thief b, he is granted 15 minutes of kill rights, so he doc's up, and puts a bounty on ore thief b... he can because he has the kill rights on the ore thief at that time... this would eliminate the \"griefing\" aspect of someone jumping into a noob system and writing down a bunch of potential targets. the size of bounties (1 mil minimum? 10 mil?) would help with the griefing... perhaps a fee to place the bounty (10% of the bounty amount as an additional cost)...also, the bounty hunter skill, a good idea as i see it, would be better served to allow for hunting is the system (level 1) up to the region (level 5) so you don't have to worry that you will shoot at someone whose bounty is a tad bigger then you can handle and get concorded.you pop in to the local bounty office, pay a fee for a \"hunting license\" and are then allowed to hunt for bounties within how ever many jumps (skill based) from that system...an addition would be how many kills per hunting license, 1 at level 1, 5 (or more) at level 5...so, my additions to the idea:1) require kill rights or something else to place a bounty on another pilot.2) require a bounty to start at set level and include a fee to place the bounty (10% suggested).3) make short term \"hunting license\" that allows a bounty hunter to hunt in that system up to region based on the \"bounty hunter\" skill. 4) bounty hunter skill that extends the area a hunting license covers as well as the number of \"kill tags\" that are included with the purchase of a hunting license. 5) hunting license would last 12 to 96 hours (skill based) or until the kill tags are used up."
"what you guys are saying is already how it is in the current bounty system in the game.my idea is to add a new fun way to make isk in eve. if you see it as i see it, this exploit you are talking about might not stop completely but with the fact of having to pay to kill, positive standings in empire and concord. it will put a thorn to those current exploits"
"i'm sure everybody agrees that there needs to be a way to kick people out of stations. the question is how, and i finally have a solution that everyone can get behind. in the system i propose, it would be possible for anyone in a given system to initiate a system-wide vote to kick someone from a station. once someone has initiated a vote, a dialog box with yes/no options would pop up for everyone in the system. once someone has voted, the dialog box displays voting statistics. to prevent abuse, nobody would be allowed to interact with anything except the dialog box until everyone in system has voted. if more than 25% of the people in the system vote yes, then the person is immediately launched into space, and is not allowed to dock for 15 minutes. if the person is not in a station at the time, then the timer is set to 20 minutes."
"this is even stupider than monster trucks."
"explain no support"
"i am sorry, you have posted abut it before, and i disagree 100%. one should not be able to simply kick people out of the station, and yulai convention should prohibit it explicitly, even in the 0.0 space, since concord regulates alliances anyway. i know no one likes a neutral or a red in one's station, but it is too much already, where they have no access to any serviced other than market, and the fact that they can see how many docked and how many in system. i mean a cov ops frigate can gather more intel than a red/neutral docked in a tin can of a station. so, not supported."

"lol wut?"

"a better solution would be cut out the main reason for them to be in the station.the market. station owners should be able set the ability to buy/sell from the station based on standings. another idea would be to allow people placing orders to be able to restrict the orders to corp/alliance/standing. implementing both of these ideas would be the most optimal situation."

"i noticed a couple very disquieting quotes from the most recent csm meeting, indicating that the csm is in danger of heading off into even further irrelevancy. this is exactly the wrong direction to take chaps. small specific issues are the ones that have the best chance of being implemented. they have the best chance of obtaining a consensus as to what exactly should be done. they have the best chance of not being misunderstood by ccp and being implemented in a way the community doesn't like. and of course, it's the 'small' issues that often have the most impact on a players enjoyment of the game. i'm extremely disappointed to see the csm just writing off small issues as 'not worth their time'. you will have much more of an impact submitting small concrete changes that don't have sweeping game wide implications than suggesting major over-arching changes to the underlying game design. if you say things like \"hey we all think the sov system needs re-work\" or \"hey exploration kinda sucks\" then ccp will cheerfully nod and say \"great feedback guys, we'll put it on our plate of stuff to think about for possibly changing much later when we have more time to make enormous big changes\" and absolutely nothing will have been accomplished. ccp already knows all these things 'need work' the csm telling them they need work isn't providing new information, nor will it move the process along. it will essentially have been a waste of your time. the csm simply isn't going to be able to get ccp to focus massive amounts of manpower and resources on game redesigns that ccp hasn't already decided need looking at and made a priority of. what the csm *can* do is submit idea for changes that have popular support and are very narrow in scope and not very difficult in implementation. fixing obvious flaws in certain ships or modules that irk the playerbase would, in my opinion, be a terrific use of csm time. (and you don't need to get into the 'nerfing' game, their are plenty of things that just need buffing or don't make sense'. for example: assault frigates sucking. this would be a great csm issue. the hawk and harpy having their skins switched. easy fix. all those threads detailing why certain amarr ships failed hard? yep, that would all have been good csm material as well. suggesting a new niche profession ship? great idea for the csm to push. specific tweaks and fixes to the ui? solid gold for the csm to pursue. these are the kind of things you have a chance of actually seeing implemented. vauge head in the clouds 'well we'd kind of like the whole game to work differently' subjects, while diverting, are simply not going to be very actionable . ccp will 'think about' them and by and large nothing will get done that ccp was going to do any way. all the csm can do is ask them to 'consider' changes, which ccp is no doubt doing just fine on their own. i bring this up because i notice from the threads in the assembly hall that huge portions of the playerbase *are* expecting the csm to discuss the small minutae of the game and not just dismiss it as being 'beneath them'. it's great to some discuss big issues (bane's capships online f.ex) and reinforce in ccp's mind that these things they are looking at *are* important, but i think it's wrong to just have a standing policy of shutting down small suggestions"
"the above may be true, but it is definitely possible to go too far in the other direction. for example, ccp may have wavered back and forward on a 'major change' topic before finally giving it the heave-ho - if the csm can demonstrate that the player base feels very strongly that this change would be welcomed and is a good idea, then ccp might actually change their minds and stick it in the next expansion.also shouldn't be blinkered that a small change is more likely to be implemented - this might be true on some issue, but a relatively small change on a specific craft could unbalance its role and make it ... well, unbalanced. i'm sure there have been many frighteningly long meetings at ccp hq about whether a specific ship would be better balanced with 4 med and 3 low, or 3 med and 4 low...i think the csm tackle *all* issues, both big and small. if nothing else, a definitive \"no\" from the devs allows everyone to drop it and move on. although how topics which have been addressed and have answers will be communicated on this (very broken) message board system for issues remains to be seen."
"/support"
"agreed, there's nothing wrong with discussing the little things too. in fact, there aren't as many new \"big\" topics being posted to this forum, since so many of the obvious hot-button ones have been raised already.yes, some of the narrow issues being suggested now could be unbalancing, depending on potential implementations. needless to say, though, after all is said on the forum, and after all is said in the csm meetings, if ccp feels that a particular recommendation would be unbalancing, they can say so and not implement it.that's not to say that the csm shouldn't be taking on the big sweeping proposals, too, though. by all means talk about the big issues, even if they're less immediately actionable."
"they're still in the first batch of submissions. there are some real high-level problems with this game, and those getting addressed up front is a good thing. most of what they've done so far has been either high-level game design or low-level fixes of stupid annoyances. give them more time, and they might stick their heads into balance issues at a smaller scale."
"for frienfly militia pilots :)why? because its scarry and sometimes hard to resist not to lock and kill (got used to it agter a hundreds of missions)...and they will look friendlier :)"
"huh?"
"from the \"empyrean age issues\" thread:you also can't suppress the warning \"you are a criminal! blah blah blah\" when trying to jump through a gate with criminal aggression, even if you're in a pod.these are just two examples. these nerfs were not discussed ahead of time, were not announced for the new patch and are not listed in the patch notes even now. with the exception of exploit fixes, nerfs should not be introduced without warning or announcement, nor without a debate about their merits or lack thereof. at the very least, it is disrespectful to the players.i would like the csm to take this up with ccp and ask them to pledge to stop this aggravating behavior."
"to be perfectly honest, wasting developer's time and resources discussing every tiny change that negatively affects someone, like your example, is pointless. following this strategy would lead to patches being delayed for a week or more while the same hundred people and their alts whine about a change that negatively affects them and positively effects (or has no effect on) the rest of eve. the devs repeatedly explain their position only to get flamed until they throw up their hands in disgust and walk away from the discussion. in addition, any change that negatively affects anyone would fall under this category."
"the complaint wasn't about the change(though the change is pretty stupid), it's about the lack of documentation or advance warning associated with it. i'll agree with op here - patches should be noted in the patch notes in all cases except things being intentionally kept secret(e.g., exploit fixes)."
"now why do you think that change was made?could it have something to do with the volume of petitions that they receive from people who have disabled that warning, then do something to invite concord to relieve them of their ship?perhaps a better idea would be to change it so that you can dismiss the warning for a specified time period: ie an option to remove the \"safeties\" if you know you are about to engage in criminal behavior.your solution needs to address the problem that caused the change.qftevery change negatively affects someone, and some changes just need to be done. so don't expect to be able to review ever change before it is made.i can agree with one point that you bring up: it would be nice if the patch notes were updated to reflect this sort of information, even if they need to make a second revision of the patch notes: ie stardard patch notes with a link to verbose patch notes.i can cite one example where ccp completely failed to properly document a significant change. not only did they fail include the change in the patch notes, their design documents were edited to indicate that no change was ever made. to top it off, the developer responsible for the change failed to pass this information on to his replacement when changing responsiblities. if ccp published compressive patch notes, it would indicate that such documentational errors are a thing of the past.as for exploit fixes: in the past the usual line \"several exploit issues have been fixed, making eve a better world to live in for us all.\" has been replaced with details of what was fixed after the fact. it would be nice if that practice was resumed."
"just change the 1500 isk per level to percentage, 2% would be a good number"
"after travelling about 400-500 jumps through all hostile 0.0 space, camping formerly well frequented routes between regions, and looking for everyone i found in local for a fight without getting a single shot fired (our setup: superfast scanning covert ops, arazu, rapier, 2 vaga), i come to the conclusion that1. all jump bridges need to be removed since you can travel in 0.0 safer than in empire nowadays (in empire you can at least get suicide ganked because you have to use a gate).2. remove cloaks from all ships that can actively engage in combat operations, or disable all weapons on a ship that has a cloak fitted.the whole 0.0 population seems to consist of cloaking raven pilots who place a pos with jump bridge in an area which is acceptable for ratting, noone seems to travel more than two jumps anymore. 0.0 is a place which should be a lot unsafer than lowsec and empire, but atm the opposite is the case. the risk vs. reward thing is way out of balance. the tactical aspect of jump bridges is completely abused and favours the defender far too much (although they don't even try to defend), but seriously, the complete game is broken. it is all blob or spin ships inside stations. roaming is a waste of time, small engagements only happen at the chokepoints to empire because that is the only place noone can use a bridge. scouting in 0.0 was once a social aspect of the game when people were forced to work together, today it is all bridges and an occasional look at some intel channel. player-player interaction, hostile or friendly, was once what made eve interesting for years. it is about to vanish from the game completely, and noone needs an online game to do their own **** really.the cloak part, i know it has been discussed over and over and over again. do with it whatever you want, but in my opinion, noone in a combat ship should be safe in 0.0 if he does not have a pos to sit in or a station to dock."
"you obviously have way to much time on your hands to go through all hostile 0.0 space. come to geminate where the fun is atm.also after spending years building up infrastructure we should be able to make space safer for ourselves."
"when i was in 0.0, i found npc space to be the most rewarding pvp-wise. the stations always attract people, and the fact that no one can claim sov keeps things interesting."
"i give my support to this issue post, since i also feel that the near complete coverage of jump bridge networks has gone way beyond what the designers initially thought. (on the other hand, if this is what they envisioned, i shall be shocked and appalled)i may not agree with total removal of jump bridges, especially not the cloaking \"fix\", but i do agree that this has become an issue in a sense that it revamped the very nature of 0.0.i should imagine most of 0.0 traveling pilots who are not the beneficiaries of these bridge networks (ie. members of those alliances) have more or less similar view on this matter."
"as you may know, clicking \"sort by date\", after searching for something using that search bar in the top right hand corner of your screen, instead of \"sort by relevance\" does nothing, except reload the page.fix please?"
"there's a lot more fixes than that it needs(like some actual search functionality, say), but this is a reasonable minor edit. also, just to save you some possible frustration, you are aware of www.eve-search.com, right? until the ccp search does get fixed, you'll save yourself some pretty monumental headaches using that site."
"superb troll post! keep it up!"
"the minutes of the csm meeting on the 24th of may 2008 (24/05/08) have been incorrectly dated within the document as 24th of june 2008."
"i also spoke about the issue in more depth here:"
"a lot of the ire against nano ships is coming from the fact that when people ask how to kill a nano ship they are told they have to go fly minmatar hac's. most people want an option against nano ships within their chosen 'race' or weapons system, and i feel such choices should be available to them.probably caldari pilots have it the worst: their ships are slow and heavy, and missiles suck vs nanos because precision heavies are randomly and inexplicably terrible. but basically, telling people they need to go fly minmatar hac's to counter nanos would be like telling folks upset at sniper fleets that they needed to go skill up for caldari marauders. diversity is good, but the counters can't be *that* restricted, each 'race' or 'weapons system' should have it's own 'flavor' of counter, some of which can be better, and some worse. i don't think your specified proposals capture that racial flavor we want to maintain, but you do raise a good point. i think it could be better fixed by bringing polycarbons back in line with other rigs, instead of being way better than the equivalent module, and by making heavy precision missiles not so god awful terrible, so that at least cruiser missile ships can hit hac's."
"still feel that the simplest fix, is to adjust agility modifier on webs so that the ships slow down faster. it should allow small nano ships to maintain speed as intended, and larger nano stuff like battleships to be taken down right quick."
"already have those to v - i'll take 2 thanks"
"fairly easy point imho. please urge ccp to implement a particular subforum (or even two, one rp, one non-rp) for fw issues. at the moment fw topics are scattered between different other forums and unnecessarily complicated to keep an eye on. plus not all \"regulars\" of the other forums are really happy with it (caod anyone?). thus in terms of sheer functionality and user-friendliness a forum for faction warfare issues is needed."
"i think fw topics in coad are better than other posts there. the others (read: regular coad posts) sound bitter and circle-jerkesque.not supported"
"or even just a sub-forum within caod for all necessary fw topics. good suggestion."
"to put it quite mildly, and not go into a jade-esq post (sorry jade but you type too much). i put a motion forward that the csm be changed internally so that there may not be two representatives from the same alliance on the board.it gives them the ability to create far to much noise - if something goes against one, the other will always stick up for them, when it comes to votes then there will always be favouritism.ccp should have thought of this prior to the elections but quite simply put, it should be the case now.regardsaneu"
"incoming 1 man alliances."
"i was about to say the same thing but with much more words. thank you for saving me the trouble."
"no. the voting system is fine as-is, and it prevents any bloc from having the power to do much of anything on its own. two goons isn't a problem, and nine goons is impossible under any set of plausible circumstances."
"that's like saying a political party can't have any more than 1 representative in parliament.stupid idea is stupid?"
"what about those of us who aren't in an alliance?btw, people can just leave their alliance/corp for the duration of the election. it won't change anything, neither do i see there is a problem as-is."
"the csm is an oog entity; what pilots are in-game (corp/alliance/carebear/pirate/etc) isn't relevant. that they are experienced players of eve online is. no support, therefore, from me.iz"
"kill up."
"who cares jade is a dumbass."
"in a word, no.the csm is an oog entity, and as such what corps and alliances the members of the csm are involved in in-game is not relevant to the council. if this behaviour had been from 'just another pilot' it would have been called trolling. the csm are expected, indeed *required* the ccp document setting up the council, to hold themselves to a higher standard and display that higher standard as an example for others to follow.this is my personal opinion, others may differ ...iz"
"not only you're late to this particular trolling thread, you also fail at your miserable attempt of propaganda.let me quote the paragraph of the csm document you're referring to:the quoted log from local chat in the op hardly establishes the grounds for a \"material breach of eula or tos\", or does it?but if in your twisted, little world you really think you have a case, i'd suggest you approach ccp about it, instead of bothering us all with your moral grandstanding.have a nice day."
"jade, with your expertise concerning twisted little worlds it's hard to argue."
"*sigh*wouldn't you be lost in the wide reaches of your ignorance, you could look me up ingame and from my employment history you could tell, that i've never been affiliated with the star fraction; quite to the contrary you'd discover that i even have been in goonswarm for a while."
"the behaviour standard in this case being a juvenile hissy fit when you don't get your way."
"great job at doing partial quotes keratinboy. like shown above the quoted sentence applies to material breachs of eula and tos\"oh and i have another quote for you:this quotes establishes the definition of \"social contract\" as being defined by eula, tos and other legal documents.and finally:it's actually explicitly allowed to state your antipathy towards other players, as long as it's not a breach of the eula, tos.but really why don't you present your case to ccp? it certainly would be highly amusing."
"so, jade is unprotected under the eula from the consequences of juvenile hissy fits? also, i have nothing against jade's antipathy towards other people, it is an irrelevance. i do think that muting people for asking reasonable questions, trying to blame your mistakes on those you dislike and trying to justify your actions by making things up out of whole cloth is rather pathetic and bespeaks of someone who really needs professional counseling. mostly, i'm glad i don't work with the guy."
"the crying in this thread is getting rather desperate. yes, i don't like goons. live with it.if the terms of standing as a csm rep had in any respect suggested that i would have to censor my free opinions as a player of eve online on the issues of goonfleet (or any other group i might happen to consider represents a nasty conformist mono-cultural clique of e-bullying mediocrity) then i wouldn't have stood under those limitations. fortunately for all our sanity there was no such clause and i was elected on the manifesto i presented to the eve player base and knowledge and aspirations for the game of eve online. if the story is always going to be \"whaaaa! jade doesn't like goons its so unfair\" - when maybe you should be asking yourselves \"why doesn't jade like goons?\" ask yourself truly \"what is there to like?\" maybe you should focus on your good points rather than relishing the bad and proving every worst preconception of your behaviour with every passing whine and pseudo-threadnaught afflicting these and other forum sections?you goons come from an organization that represents about 2.5% of the player base. yet you have direct csm representation from 2 representatives and a little under 20% of the csm voting power. maybe its time to realize you did pretty well out of the csm elections and learn to sit on your good fortune without whining about \"how unfair\" everything is? a little bit of introspection can be helpful in these circumstances."
"more goon manure. you'd think they would choke on their own hypocrisy. guess the world just isn't that fair.windjammer"
"the op was asking if it was inappropriate, not asking whether it violated the eula/tos. nobody is claiming the latter, but a majority of people seem to believe the former."
"after reading the chat log of csm meeting #5, i believe the csm is due some congratulations. that meeting was the first time i've seen the csm function in a manner free from unpleasant behaviour. i've not been able to read the log from meeting #4 as i've not found a link to it, so i don't know when the change occured or why, but it has occured.so congratulations to all of you on the csm. finally, some light is seen at the end of the tunnel. yes, darius, this if for you too.best regards,windjammer"
"the csm so far has done well lets see what comes out of it the coming meetings :)i have a good feeling about it :)"
"thanks!i'm extremely happy about the recent development with csm. i believe the rotating moderation is really showing it's worth. so i look forward to using this for the rest of the term."
"in actual fact meetings 1,2,4 & 5 have all been generally constructive.meeting 3 had 'the fun' but even there all the 'real business' was discussed.following meeting 3 several csm members made 'calls' on ccp to clarify the role of the csm document in managing meetings. the response from ccp made it clear that we were to set our own rules and procedures for meetings. this, combined with a general acceptance by all parties that we need to work constructively with each other as 'adults' and 'equals', has meant a change in attitude and a more sensible approach from pretty much everyone involved.several other commonsense changes instituted by jade post ccp's feedback have also helped.namely:- rotating chair - the person introducing an issue now chairs/manages that section of the meeting. therefore if you're going to act like a disruptive **** in someone else's section you run the risk of having the same thing happening when you try and manage you own section. - procudural discussions have been moved to aob at the end of the meeting when all 'issues' have been discussed.if someone does have issues with how meeting is managed/chair's decision/some other procedural point of order ccp has made it clear that we can raise it on the agenda of the next meeting when we can discuss/vote on it according to our own views of how meetings should run rather than arcane interpretations of the csm document.i have no doubt that at some stage we will have arguements over 'procedure' again but hopefully with everyone acting like grown ups and not politicians trying to score points, these can be sensibly resolved without gigantic biterness..."
"yes i agree they are doing a really good job atm. maybe they just needed to settle in a bit. (shut up windjammer i am agreeing with, don't be a toad.)it looks like this crew is the crew that will define the csm and how it is operated for future reps. good job csm crew."
"i've had epiphany. you guys are slave labour for ccp, you exsist so ccp doesn't have to wade through all the crap on the forums. you should demand some sort of wage or recompense for your time tbh."
"actually, ccp posted the first three meetings' minutes a little while days back. they're not obvious, but they're on the left sidebar - csm is 6 below forums. they need to fix up the filenames, but they're there."
"well, duh. :p note however that cpp doesn't \"have\" to do that anyway, public forums are usually largely ignored by developers. there is no other way to stay sane.one would hope that all candidates ran with the intention to put some effort into working for the greater good of the community (and cpp)."
"you don't think a free trip to iceland is a good enough recompensation? i certainly think it's more than what could be expected from volunteer work."
"i partially disagree with the op.in regards of the csm work and the political bickering associated with it, i'd like to point out that it's in no way different from the political process you happen to encounter in real life politics. if you have a tv channel dedicated to live feeds from parliamentarian debate, like c-span in the us or phoenix in germany, you'd see that your lofty representatives there doesn't behave like adults at all. in fact a typical parliamentarian debate usually it's fair share of trolling and flaming, at least in the controversial subjects (i'd recommend tax legislation and \"passing the budget\" debates for it ). also bitterly flame wars on voting procedure, speaking rights and other \"administrative procedures\" aren't unheard of in real life politics.i'd be very wary of a parliamentarian body where everybody is hugs and kisses with everyone else. if there aren't differences in opinion there isn't a need parliament in the first place. in light of this the csm hasn't done such a bad job indeed."
"you are right but not quite what i was on about . im all for people arguing over politics but my main concern is for example the corp/alliance section. in the old days.. 3-4 years ago that place was always a good read. alliances acutally cared about the story behind the war. hell we even had a cease fire over kicking tti out in the north. now its just lets invade x space then smack them on the forums like it was counter strike. another example is the annoying.. reply to a thread : 2nd!! / im in a bob thread!! type rubbish . its just a reply to get a witty comment to boost there ego where it means nothing to the thread. eve is a political warfare. not a space counter strike sim. im not very good at explaining my self but i hope it made sense. ill probably get flamed but hey.. for those who were around i bet my last cookie they would of agreed"
"given that the whole complaint about you as chair was that you decided to silence people for no good reason, anyone who requested that you be banned would be both an idiot and a flaming hypocrite. you cannot seriously believe this. if they were even amateur forum trolls, there'd be a whole lot more of them than the maybe 20 you see around these parts. yes, there are individual goons who are idiots. any group of 5000 will have those, especially if they're from one of the various cesspools of the internet. but to tar them all with one brush is about as silly as, say, limiting you to 50-word posts. drop the \"i'm so hard done by!\" bull**** and the savage anti-goon bigotry, and get back to internet spaceships."
"yea but you have to understand is was a much smaller player base at that time also. you know when you have a peak night of 2000 people online you have to know that there is a big fight on somewhere. but you had the smack too. it was not all about back stories and what not. and some of those flames then were pretty much like they are now. the only difference now however is you have a much bigger player base and a much larger crowd of trolls that is porportionate with the growth."
"any group of 5000 would be held accountable for the actions of their \"individual idiots\", if nobody in the group spoke out against them."
"actually, ccp is a privately held corporation, and as such are not required to release annual financial statements (balance sheet, income sheet, retained earnings statement, statement of cash flows, and other accounting terms that i haven't learned yet). they have no obligation towards us, and we have no obligation towards them, except that which is set in the eula and terms of service."

"against,the tank needs looking at, but not the wepon systems - they are in line with the way they are supposed to work (choise of damage type). adding and subtracting slots is not the answer, neither is removing the citadel launchers. a solution, if there is one that is needed, has to work with the current ship."

"the point of this thread is not to suggest specific changes, but rather to point out the huge disadvantage of minmatar capital ships. the naglfar definitely needs a stronger tank and needs a significant dps upgrade and i think we can all agree about that, even if we disagree on how to get there.i highly doubt any issue will go through ccp exactly the way it is presented in the op."
"its tedious to set up one pos. unless one pos is \"spam\", then your argument falls apart.nor are the problems with pos warfare and those of putting up pos mutually exclusive, you can indeed fix both."
"agree with twd. what i hope comes out of this is that sov warfare as a whole gets revised. it's just anti-fun on so many levels."
"you really don't get it, do you?pos warfare and sovereignty are already being revised, but that's going to take months and a major content patch to come about. this is something that can be done now to fix a part of the game that is demonstrably broken, and which can easily be countered to prevent pos spam. this proposal does not preclude any other changes to pos logistics, and i honestly can't believe that you haven't worked this out yet."

"not supported.if the damage mod is increaced, then the clip size stays the same and rof goes down. that means you get your alpha, but the dps stays the same (you are supposed to have the lowest dps in the game.) this i would support because its balance.if the clip size is increaced, then the rof goes down and damage mod remain the same since reloading is balanced with rof.if rof is increaced, then the damage mod needs to come down, and the clip remains the same - but this option makes it a gimped hybrid turret.pick one, not all.as for capless. . .i'm sorry, its a big deal. you have high alpha (the hp boost affected everyone) and a good selection of damage types against armor tanked or armor hp-buffed (which is most ships in fleet) ships. yes, 1400s are sub-par, but they can too easily become too good. the above selection is what i would work with, which do you choise?(i would pick higher damage mod myself)"
"signed"
"if there were to be a bigger alpha, the rof would be increased. i think some of us may have been interpreting the wording differently. rate of fire could mean to some the time inbetween, thus making it higher, makes the guns slower. however, i think you are thinking of it as a literal rate, of which higher means faster firing. anyway, the general consensus thus far is either better tracking, or a bigger alpha with a slower firing time. the dps would thus remain the same."
"make the rof extremly fast and give it a 4 clip size. this would be an alternative to more damage and slower rof. it would then have high burst damage and need to reload or have high alpha and then a long time between shots.why can't 1200mm be burst guns and 1400mm be high high alpha guns?"
"i havent read every single post in this thread, but one thing people ssem to be missing out is that min ships, especially the bs are a little more flexible in thier tanking ability than other bs. you have the option to go for an active shield or armor tank, i'd like to see someone armor tank a raven, although someone probably flies one.maybe this is why arties are missing the dev lovin atm"
"you can shield tank domis. passive sheild tank them at that. i fail to see the issue. nobody is arguing that the guns should be more dps. just that they need their alpha ability back so long term they are still the same gun. less actually as there is no way to decrease reload time."

"inanna, to me the main reason people would like the jump clone delay shortend even just an hour is that many of us have very limited/set hours that we can play so a 24 hour delay means that we may have to wait an extra day before being able to jump clone back whereas with a 23 hour delay we'd be able to get much more value out of our time. i do understand having a delay in to discourage hopping around new eden like a rabbit but like the \"align to\" button i think this change could make a big difference to quite a few people.as to my view. i'd like to see it get dropped back even just a single hour to 23. the idea for a skill sounds quite interesting as well and i'd support that to."

"so when you find such a belt, you make twice the money you would in highsec, and you find the risk/reward ratio acceptable. it seems to me then that the only problem here is the rarity of such belts - mineral prices are fine, mineral usage is fine, it's just that lowsec doesn't feature enough of the valuable ores to sustain what lowsec miners would be willing to supply. would that be a fair assessment?"
"/signed"
"yes, but:if you increase the supply of highend ore in lowsec, you end up decreasing its value, thus \"nerfing\" 0.0, and to a very small extent lowsec hidden belts.also, to gain access to those belts you need to spend significant amounts of time scanning down the belt (and training scan skills). akita t was only discussing \"freely available ore\", the one that can be found in standard belts, and in that respect lowsec mining is exactly equal to highsec mining in isk/hour.i'd much rather see a very high-yield veldspar roid in lowsec and 0.0 that gives 2x-5x the amount of tritanium that normal veldspar gives.doing this will:- increase veldspar supply, decrease its cost- increase highend demand, increase their costoverall, a boost to 0.0 mining, and to some extent lowsec mining as well"
"excuse me ? have you even bothered actually reading the op ? how about you do it now ? how about this part : \"the issue is not so much the fact that something needs to be done, but the fact that it needs to be done fast[...]this issue needs urgent attention, no matter what the chosen alternatives are (because there's plenty)\"how can i say it in any other words and still be clear enough ?it doesn't matter which exact solution you choose (because for minerals/ore alone i gave three separate sets of solutions : two common to both ore-refined minerals and moon materials, one set individual for each, and the third set for minerals was a conglomeration of several possibilities too), heck, there might even be other possible solutions too... it only matters that it's done sooner rather than later, because it's been broken for so long that some people (yes, i am talking about you) almost consider it normal.except that gneiss is a 0.0 ore, not a lowsec ore. if gneiss would be found in sufficient quantities in lowsec without exploration (which itself takes not only time and money in form of probes, but also a significant amount of luck too), then yeah, you would have a case.the fact he says he mines veld in 1.0 normally can only mean one thing : the lowsec gneiss mining, that's most likely aduro protocol \"corp mining ops\", not something he actually bothers doing actively (i.e. search for hidden belts). so, if somebody else in his corp finds this pocket of 0.0 ore in some lowsec (i.e. 0.0 rewards), a pocket where risks are lower than normal in lowsec (since it's a hidden pocket, not just the usual belt mining), they shouldn't mine it ? and even that, with higher rewards and lower risks than normal, and it sounds as barely tolerable... i'd call \"normal\" lowsec mining then pathetic, at best."
"there's only one problem with that, but then again, the situation is all so completely fubar and ccp's actions so counter-intuitive lately that it makes little or no sense, so you might as well do it : that supposed problem would be mineral flow. in the initial \"specs\", highends were supposed to be exported out of 0.0 (by a minority of miners), a good deal of midlevels were supposed to come from lowsec (by a few more miners), and highsec was supposed to provide most of the lowends (provided by a vast majority of miners).long story short (and it's a long story), the system used to work reasonably well before the introduction of the drone regions (it wasn't very good, but it \"sort of\" worked, so there was no reason for any changes), but with a veritable deluge of highends from the drone regions, the whole system collapsed in itself.and instead of having ccp fludizing lowend mineral transfers out into the areas that can use/need it, what do we see ? the exact opposite, ccp nerfs lowend compression rates, and nerfs hauling a lot of compressed lowend goods.so, if they no longer care about people in 0.0 importing trit from empire, oh, to hell with them... just introduce those \"uber-veldspar\" asteroids (x2/x3 in lowsec, up to x6 even in 0.0) and be done with it, case closed... and i'm only being mildly sarcastic here."
"supported"
"high ends from 0.0 mining would still be exported but trit from mining would be more than trit from ratting in 0.0 which is the problem i ahve atm. if you took current prices at a rough guess i am 7m/hour in veld or around 30-40m in 0.0 on ark. if you made a 4x veld roid for 0.0 for 28m/hour and a 10% roid in empire for arkonor at 3m/hour we would still mine ark in 0.0 and veld in empire but at least would be getting more trit from mining than ratting again."
"that's the crux of the issue. i really think most people have little to no clue just how much volume in minerals loot drops create. both drone regions and mission runners elsewhere.a good mission runner or drone region user can actually outproduce a null sec miner in mid and high ends. and to boot, they'll be getting bounties and mission rewards as well. they are also combat armed, can stay in relative safety compared to a null sec miner as well....that's the crux of the issue. why bother mining when the prices are held artificially low because of this?remove high ends and mids from loot and drone regions. or at the very least reduce their amounts and you'll take the first step towards fixing what is broken."
"by that same logic you could just make all the ores refine to 10x the current amount to fix the ratio. across the board this would simply make the price of all the minerals fall but would eliminate or at least reduce the weird problems that mission loot and drone mins cause.btw that is not my preferred method to try and fix this. just saying it would greatly reduce the effect of the drone regions and mission loot as mineral sources as opposed to mining."
"ultimately, something has got to give - if you want more mining done in low-sec, prices will drop elsewhere. you could go the route of adding new ores in low-sec, of course. if you believe in akita t's idea of how minerals should flow, then you're going to want a better source of mexallon than plagioclase, and a better source of isogen than omber in there, and both should give far more tritanium than existing low-sec ore does. nocxium is already best supplied from low-sec, but with its price in the tank, that means nothing, and explains most of the reason why low-sec is bad right now(if nocx were at its base price, lowsec mining would be 2x as valuable as highsec). personally, i prefer the simpler solution, of making the low-end 0.0 ores available in lowsec via scannable belts. it requires less screwing about, and has less of a chance to break things inadvertently. if you prefer adding new low-sec ores you could advocate for that and i won't oppose, but my default play is a bit simpler than that. i'm not in favour of removing the need for exploration - as i said above, 0.0 ore in scannable lowsec belts seems like the right way to fix lowsec to me. also, i'd like to see some stats on the nocxium market, because that's what's really destroying lowsec profitability. and who is saying that they shouldn't mine it?"
"the benefit of having higher quality roids in lowsec and null sec of the same minerals is that it still freely allows the market to control teh price of minerals. it simply means that the same roid will likely be mined in low sec and null sec as in high sec (this is where the actual % balances come in and sec status bands.) if in 1 region the .5 systems have a higher grade of omber that in most other regions requires .4 status to obtain then more people in region a will mine omber than in region b. the same with other ores along the border zones of sec status. no matter what though mining in low sec will be better once you cross a band to a better version of the high sec ore. this allows the market free room which imho is working as it should.edit. also exploration should always be better than normal belts simply due to the extra time and cost of probes involved. maybe these better roids have simply been missed this entire time and you scanned them down and profited."
"truth be told we all may just be spinning our wheels when it comes to changing roid size, quality, amount. since it still is slated to eventually remove static belts and make all roids only found via exploration."
"it is? wow, that's stupid. it's not every day you hear a proposal that would remove the best income source for old players(ratting) and brand new players(who don't know how to scan) in one fell swoop."
"i believe the type of exploration mentioned in kazzac's post is the kind using the onboard scanner that doesn't require any skills/mods/etc."
"i'm referring to the fact that the player won't know how to do it, not any issues about skill points."
"as your getting annoyed, i thought a revist to the op was useful to refocus everything.eve has a free market, that means cartels, monolopies, great profits, artificial shortages and every other vice and abuse that can be conceived of. thats a free market, its call ecomonic warfare, winner takes all, i'm all right jack you sad loser, no holds barred pvp. it's ok for an alliance to own every high end moon and set a price, its ok to dump goods to reduce prices so others can't profit, its ok to restrict supply, thats the point/nature of the game, do you agree with that?that is the eve market, its deregulated, that means that \"we\" set the prices and thereby the reward and thereby profit margin/amount contained in the reward.as the market actually dictates behaviour we expect ppl to concentrate where the greatest perceived profits are, when they are exploited by too many people the price of the goods derived from the activity will decreace due to over supply, this way we get high reward goods giving poor profit, the reward is degraded by the activity, thats the free market at work. if a raw material becomes in short supply reward will increace and people will fulfill that demand when they perceive that the reward is high enough to provide the level of profit they want.its not broken its working as intended, gluts of products must happen in a free market because of too many ppl entering the market segment as they perceive profit opportunity, rewards and profit margins cannot be set in stone as that is not the nature of the games vision. now as i said before if changes are made it will happen when tech 3 comes out as that's what needed to redistribute demand for the basic raw materials of production as it actually adds to the game experience on many levels and not complicate it needlessly because some ppl perceive and issue and panic. as for veldspar and trit having a rising price its just an effect of lots of new production taking advantage of reduced cost of the other minerals due to over supply, these goods will further erode the reward and profit will diminish as they enter the market place.again reward does not equate to net profit, the market will find its own level, its a cold harsh world and its not ment to be fair or even."

"surprise surprise ,do i look like a caldari hater? i am caldari for god's sake! this character is at least.for the speeds you are exagerating. consider that a crusader (3 overdrives ii ,1 nanofiber ii) with top speed of 7100 can orbit at 21km at around 5600 with acceleration control lvl 3 and navigation lvl 5 with an align time of 4 sec crow's top speed with these skills is 6100 (3 overdrives ii) (align time 4.5) so when orbiting will be less than what you said. maybe with top skills it goes up but who has top skills anyway.also here are many cases that an interceptor won't orbit so far away. in small gangs that don't have the luxury of a rapier the interceptor may have to web so it will have to orbit closer so the orbiting speed will be lesser. also you may pretend you are some expert crow pilot but if you orbit so far away you won't be able to scramble since the crow has no bonus in the warp disruptor unless you overheat but not many have that skill. in any case it's not always possible to orbit so far also because there is some possibitlity that the target manages to get out of your scrambling range. so you may have to orbit closer just to be sure. so i loged with this account to show you that even if you pass this change you will benefit me. hate me as much as you like for being who i am , a guy that cares about game balance regardless of what suits him best. you boost caldari? i am happy. you boost gallente i am happy. you boost minmatar i am happy, you boost amarr i am happy. i happen to worry though for the player that has only 1 account and the changes may not make him so happy."
"this is the last time i'm feeding this troll:1) my crow does 6.3kms. 2x odii, 1x nfii, ac iv. learn to fit crows.2) interceptors tackling at sub 24km is fail. my warp disrupter ii goes to 24km. why on earth would i orbit at 21km?3) if your crow goes to web, expect to be counterwebed and instapopped by the vast majority of pvp targets you will engage.4) if you want to orbit closer to ensure the target can't *somehow* juke scrambling, be prepared to take a hit. you would take it from most other turret based ships.5) drakes don't have velocity bonus to missiles. as gypsio stated, those missiles won't even catch you once you break 5.5kms6) none of your points are relevant to this fix.7) finally, i don't hate you. i hate your troll posts. now leave."
"oh yeah? well my crusader goes 7100 but still when it orbits at 21 (3 overdrives ii, 1 nanofiber ii )it doesn't go beyond 5600. perhaps if i had ac 4 could go a bit more but always that speed would be below the max possible speed. so improbable your crow to orbit at it's max speed as well. because the way the game works nothing works at the exact nominal range. for example one may have drone range 54km but if you are siting at 54km the drones will deny to attack. you have to go down to 53km to actually fire them. this from experience. so you can't expect that you will orbit with that crow at 24km and that the crow will maintain that exact orbit at all times. you need to leave some space to it. let's not forget that your target isn't static and that will affect yopur orbit accuracy. that is why you chose a closer orbit that the nominal for your disruptor. there is no rule imposing that every ship wears always a webber at the mids. let alone that it has happened before to be grabed in web by a deimos and still was unable to hit me with blasters probably because i was orbiting at 500. why should the cerberus have the insane advantage to pwn any ceptor in most cases irregardless of mwd or not? i am prepared to take a hit but not be pwned with a couple of slavos as you try to make happen.how about cerberus? cerberus with the rate of fire bonus makes around same damage as a drake and with velocity bonus with your upgrade will catch even ceptors travelling at 9km. let alone that will be the ship that will pwn the nano cruisers even the average vagabond without breaking a sweat. why should cerberus be so much upgraded? because you happen to fly it? they are but you fail to realise it blinded by your arrogance.i don't hate you either. i hate only your arrogant geekish posts. nop, i am not leaving"
"sounds good. i've never used the things myself, but i can see a boost when one's needed."
"also, zaran, the \"30% damage\" was for a ship going about 4600m/s. your 5600m/s sader will be taking minimal damage. minimal. also, vagabonds can easily get over 10km/s. they aren't going to be too greatly affected by this change. it's mainly the other nano cruisers that will have to start sweating (which is nice, because, honestly, i doubt creodron had speed in mind when they built the ishtar...)."
"just like nothing should out-run an inti in the ships department, nothing should outrun a missle. especially a percision missle."
"this belongs on the first page"
"although i'm sure there is scope for tweaking of the exact figures, it is unquestionable that precision heavies need some sort of boost, as currently they are worse than precision cruise in all pvp situations that occur.and no more discussing pve in this thread, please."
"this zaran troll fails hard in almost every possible way. heavy precision missiles are not 'very good' in pve, they are extremely sub-par for what you use them for in pve and you'd be much better off using drones. fortunately for you, pve is very rewarding of terrible play and so you can get by even using atrociously bad tactics and fits.that said, obviously pve performance has 0 impact on whether or not something is balanced for pvp so i'm not sure why you even brought it up, unless you wanted to firmly establish your noob credentials. now, moving onto the interceptors issue, obviously you are terrible at fitting and flying interceptors, or simply lack the skill points to do it. 6km/s should be considered a 'base speed' for interceptors and it only goes up from there when you add in more epxensive implants and rigs and gang bonuses. 12km/s is routine. as malvortex showed, anything moving 6km/s or greater is going to be virtually immune to heavy precision missiles (and don't forget the signature radius penalty for shooting heavies at interceptors, and remember that the game will use whichever is least good for the attacker - so even if heavy precision had an explosion velocity of infinity they'd still do crap damage to interceptors because of their tiny sig radius, but that wouldn't even matter because they couldn't even hit an interceptor in the first place, as an inties speed is higher than the max velocity of heavy missiles shot by a drake)"
"it's supposed to be able to counter nano ships, that's the entire point of the vessel. it can't right now because precision heavies are bugged and useless (arguably all explosion velocities across the board are too low, but the heavy precision missile problem is undeniable).however, it still wouldn't harm interceptors with heavy missiles, because while the heavy missiles might conceivably be able to catch the interceptor, they'd do almost no damage, because the interceptor would be flying so much faster than their explosion velocity. this is simply untrue. see pulse lasers, for example. moreover, consider that if the turret ship being orbited by an interceptor has a turret ship friend, the turret ship friend can shoot and hit the interceptor from a decent distance away. a missile ship orbited by an interceptor with a missile ship friend is helpless - you can go fast enough to be immune to all missiles shot by anyone on the battlefield. that's hardly fair. you should instead have to use some skillful piloting to outrun the missiles until they burn out."

"we are early into the factional warfare age, and as expected there are several quirks and bugs that present themselves as problems. the most annoying and obtrusive i have encountered thus far is that when visiting allies in their space (in example, my faction being minmatar, and friends being gallente) those allies do not show up as blue, much less as a more identifiable blue or purple star. when visiting hostile factions (in my situation, amarr or caldari), my enemies display as a red star visable on overview and in local, so it would only make sense that allied factions display with an easily identifiable marker.it should further be noted that while a ceo of a fw corp can set all of the allied factions corp's blue, they still cannot set the npc faction corp (tribal, 24th, fdu, state protectorate) to blue, and cannot be blue to the majority of the pilots in there. proposal: friendly factions should display with a blue star, end to end."

"there have been some threads on why some people do not like the current storyline, while others do like the \"epicness\" of the story.this thread is not about that.the story now is as it is. that's what we have now. period.this thread is about the future.the problemthere is one thing i want for the future, something that was taken away recently. and that's internal disagreement. factions within the factions. bickering. that is the kind of stuff that enables great rp - it's not the big disagreements with others, it's the small disagreements between the people that actually share most goals, that makes people really feel for a group.if you have someone who disagrees slightly with you, you will be able to actually develop the exact positions of your stance. a group that mostly agrees, but in parts goes the opposite way, makes people really able to get emotional about something.this is what was awesome about a lot of the great storyarcs in eve.while clear distinctions - obvious blacks and whites, unified sides, etc. - lend themselves to nice stories you can read, it's the small differences, the small disagreements, the compromises for a common enemy, that make something enjoyable to live in. and we are not reading eve, we are living in it.an examplelook at the minmatar story. we have on the one hand the republic under midular, and on the other hand shakor, her opponent, the defiants, together with rp groups like electus matari and ushra'khan to support the respective groups. both share goals - they want freedom for the matari - but they differ in the means, in actually quite small understandings on what would be good for that goal and what would not be.this was awesome. it allowed for great rp over five years now. small differences within a faction. having to unite against the common enemy, but not really agreeing. ask anyone who participated what the best aurora storyarcs were, and you get the muritor arc listed among the best of them almost consistently. this story arc gave lots of good rp to all people. and that was not because it was a heroic guy going against the common enemy, but because it was the tragic story about the small differences between groups who really share a goal boiling over and clashing together.i hope to get something similar back eventually. we have a war now, we have to work together, but we don't have to like it, and the small differences really matter.and while we can of course come up with our own small differences, having them reflected in the official story is much more rewarding.some ideasccp and the volunteers have had great ideas in the past, they will have more in the future. these are just some ideas. maybe others can add some more ideas, too.the matari could have a pro-peace group and a pro-genocide group, and/or the tribes disagreeing on how to defeat the amarr, how to free our people.the amarr could do with more bickering among themselves - the houses actually disagreeing, not just going all hail jamyl.the caldari could do with some opposition to heth that's not dying to an acute case of nyx.the gallente could do with the intaki being a bit more separatist about the war. (i'm not really in the caldari/gallente story, so not sure about these ideas :-))tl;dri want bickering within factions.it's the small differences within a group that make the group come alive, that give you emotions about the group.it's not the group being all united against the common enemy.(a joke as an example ;-))"
"yep, i agree.the conflicts that are completely unsolvable short of violence are interesting but only go so far. look how predictable igs banter between the matari & the imperials gets.conflicts that have you arguing, but not to the point of shooting make for more interesting rp."
"it seems like a lot of the stories recently have been internal to an empire - the stuff about karin midular, tibus heth's takeover of the caldari state, the stuff about the head of the 7th fleet getting sacked, and all that. i don't disagree with you on what we should see in future, but i think you're being a bit harsh towards the recent past."
"all the stories have been about the empires uniting behind a single person. heth has no opposition. midular has voluntarily stepped back and everyone is united behind shakor. the heirs of the houses of amarr all said they do not want the throne, jamyl is great as an empress. that's what i mean. we get a story about the individual empires, but they're not about the differences within the empires, but about how they put their differences behind them and unite behind a strong leader.which is a nice story, but boring to rp. :-/"
"maybe anything sold by npcs can reprocess into 1 trit."
"nah, i don't want people losing control towers for 1 trit just because they misclick(for reasons of user error, lag, or whatever). i'd rather have them not refine at all than have them refine for a token amount."
"except your rifter never was any of those things. what the hell kind of argument is that anyway?"
"/signed"
"not that i understood all of that. but i agree with anything lavista says. that's why i voted for him."
"seems to be a lot of guys don't like the new helios being based on the imicus hull. i've always like it, but some think it's ugly.so how about making it black? matt black or flat black. that'd make it sexy and you'd still have the imicus hull."
"lol that was fast."
"i hope it would either be changed back to the old hull or imicus hull could be updated to something that doesn't look like a broken falice with a peg leg. look at it from the front view if you doubt it.don't get me wrong, eve has gorgeous ships - hurricane, nyx, vexor and many more including my favorite of them all - the old helios. and then it changes to this broken abortion.i feel like just had an awesome night at the club, brought home a beautiful girl, had tons of fun with her during the night only to find myself in an ugly-cayote situation in the morning.all in all, if its a real problem to change it back i support (nay plead) changing it to black... preferably non-reflective black to hide this eye-sore in the short time it takes me to activate the cloak. at least temporarily while i am training for buzzard.i love you ccp, you are one insanely talented bunch. but this design is not one of your best.- angrymax (cov-ops scout and industrial designer in rl)"
"indeed.. i would like it black.. i mean, you cant be a cover ops operative if yo ugo around like a carnival samba dancer! please, change it do black.."
"black could be better,but the truth is that imicus hull is just plain uglyits like a fist in the face,and first time i saw it my first thought was \"omg they ruined it\""
"make it pink"
"i support this. black would be way better."
"i like the imicus hull..."
"i almost always like black..."
"isn't the color scheme of a ship dependent on the corporation responsible for it's development? iirc, creodron has greenish ships, so it would be in line with the standard color scheme. granted, it looks ugly as sin, but that's what the cloaking device is for."
"i honestly have no idea why creodron makes the helios anyway. duvolle (black/goldish) or roden (black/red) would be nice."
"the imicus is a drone carrier."
"*bump*i edited and modified a better concept in my first post"
"while i support (strongly support) renovating the player bounty system, i feel your idea still leaves room for both grief and, as far as i can tell, self collection.self collection is the biggest flaw with the current system. if i put a 100 million isk bounty on player a, whats to stop player a logging on an alt (or enlisting a friend), podding himself, and pocketing your money himself? at the moment, nothing. its this reason why no sensible player would ever put a bounty on their enemy's head.does your system control for this? is there any reason why, if i have a bounty put on my head, i can't simply find a friend with the required skill/standings and have him pod me, so we can split the cash? if not, it hasn't fixed anything much."
"while novel, it opens even more avenues for abuse than the current one does.no support here"
"more? please explain the only problem is already out and its already in the current bounty system.the problem is the multiple accounts players... i really don't know what to do about it. there is no way to trace the difference of an account to another ingame unless you know the guy. its true that one can get all the necessary to be a bounty hunter in one account and be a criminal in the other. its the same as one macro mine in one (or multiple)account and buys/sell free gtc with isk or for money, i can also add it to the fw, one is in the gallentean militia and the other in the caldari... same for alliances, one in bob and the other in goon... you get the point?having multiple accounts can bring lots of exploiting. its not just about the bounty system. this problem is in the eve online game core itself.continuing about the idea:about the 'ask a friend' argument, its true and its already there. what is coming up to me is:1.you can't claim a bounty from a member of the same corp/alliance. 2.with the high standings needed with concord and in sec. status, it slims the chance to find a friend that has all the requirement."
"the proposed system not only leaves self collecting open, it also leaves it open for grief abuse that bypasses security checks and or wardecs, etc...imho any bounty system should go straight into the ccp coffers as a sink, and the amount of isk on ones head increases the amount, difficulty, and how low into sec status faction navies will spawn to kill you. the amount of your bounty is reduced by every pop, and could be based on a number of things like ship value, etc...the spawns give no loot, nor salvage, nor bounty. and the higher difficulty ones will spawn support frigates for scram, nos, etc...and for players to collect on bounties, they have to be in a bounty corp much like fw for instance....just ideas mulling in my head"
"yes it bypass security check and wardec. the guy is a bounty hunter, he bought a license to kill and collect a bounty. he shot anything else that is not hostile or bounty he losses sec. status license and rights to be a bounty hunter. it should be a severe penalty.also i don't think it should be mixed with militia, or fw etc...a bounty hunter is like a independant concord agent, npc don't deal with bounty's players do."
"thats the problem.. door is wide open for lots of grief"
"ah! so to counter this grief, a creation of some kind of bh npc corp that would be run by concord. and to be a bh you need to be in that corp. could be a one time join, if he quits, no more bounty hunting for him."
"sorta the idea, obviously does not eliminate alts, but it would reduce spur of the moment griefing the proposal opens up"
"worst idea i saw"
"not constructive - navigator"
"so ... person a initiates a vote, person b is afk, and no one in the station can do anything until person b has voted?"
"sounds good. thanks for detailing the idea."
"why would your timer be based on time spent logged in? is there anything else in eve that follows this logic?what would stop alts from accepting the contract and podding their mains?its a nice idea and your system for it isn't bad, but it doesn't address whats mainly wrong with the bounty system (self claiming it)."
"just seems to be far too many ways to exploit it, and whats wrong with taking out contracts on the \" big guys\" seems a bit bias"
"thanks for the support. it really does look as though this forum was thrown together in a few hours' work and i'm not very impressed with it."
"throughout 0.0, there are offline poses scattered everywhere. the effort required to destroy these outweighs the benefits (often there's none), so they sit there forever.my suggestion is that offline poses unanchor after a week so that anyone may come and scoop them."
"simple post really, the last player video added to the eve video channel was the day of darkness video. and unless there is some issue with it i feel like clear skies it just too awesome for them to not host the video on the download page.this would help free up the guys using their bandwidth for us to download the movie, i mean that's a lot of bandwidth, thank you guys!i know this isn't a csm issue per say, but hell this is the only forum where we can tick support.so do you think it's worthy?"
"not seen that other video you mention, but clear skies used imagery from another game as well, didn't it? probably some stonking copyright issues right there.however, it does present both graphics engines in a pretty favourable light so i'm sure something could be worked out :)"
"/signedthat movie is the best advertisement for eve ever."
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"had clear skies used nothing but eve in-game footage i would have to say that i agree. as it does not, i think that it does not belong on the official video page."
"no. i don't see why ccp needs to support this."
"it was a good video and all, but it is not a ccp product."
"it's always nice to see devs posting in various threads on the forums, but sometimes it can be difficult to locate them if they are hidden in 16-page threads. i know that there is a dev finder, but it doesn't seem to list every dev post made.i think a change like this would be simple and very helpful."
"me likey."
"if you have a look at evemon and add as many skills that use charisma as possible, you will find that it only suggests presence v at about 24 million skillpoints worth of charisma using skills, or about 483 days worth of training. it seems that this is the case with the other rank 3 learning skills at level 5. it seems a complete waste of time to spend over 2 weeks training a skill which has virtually no practical use.decrease the length of rank 3 learning skills time? or just perhaps demote them to rank 2.thoughts?"
"how is it bad how it is? if you think you're going to stick around for 2 years, you can train it. if not, give it a pass."
"for presence 5 actually to be useful (useful being cutting out 1 day and 19 hours) you need to train every leadership skill to 5, and every social skill to 5, culminating in 483 days, 23 hours, 47 minutes, and 57 seconds, with my learning skills already. on a blank account, that would take a much longer time.after 484 days, who cares about 1 day and 19 hours?! and besides, who is going to spend 484 days training every leadership and social skill?"
"you're assuming that the devs will never release another skill that requires charisma.however, i would not be surprised if some new charisma-oriented skills showed up in, say, ambulation."
"is this a case of the learning skills taking too long, or a case of charisma being an underused attribute?"
"level 5 of rank 3 learning skills not being time-effective."
"ok, so we have been given the ability to filter out drones, wrecks, fleet ships, militia ships, cans, etc from our overviews, but how about the ability to remove them from our view entirely? this would decrease lag a great deal if the server was not having to send the location of every wreck, can and drone to pilots.after this, upgrades can be then made to the system, such as filtering out ships. for example, an option that allows a specific pilot not to be shown to your screen. this would help in fleet ops by removing all unnecessary ships from your screen, reducing fleet op lag. a lot less strain would be on systems if they didn't have to load things on the grid that have no use to them.or, instead of having to load the physical representation of the object in question, just having the symbol flying around. this way, the model doesn't need to be loaded, only the location of the object.and how about the option to lower the range at which models are shown, so that people with slower systems can reduce what they see to a 100km radius."
"not a bad idea, but can't we already effectively do something very like this by zooming all or most of the way out? only the very biggest ships' models are loaded, and everything else is just dots and icons. if you're in a situation with zillions of things on the screen at the same time, chances are you're navigating by the overview anyway."
"it won't decrease lag, because the system will still have to send it to you - you won't be able to fly through ships just because you turned them off. also, isn't this what bracket filters do already?"
"i thought graphic filters are for the overview?and the system will still have to send you the location of the model, just not the model itself."
"the model itself is stored on your hard drive - graphics is dealt with locally. and a couple patches ago they brought in \"bracket filters\" - screw around in your overview settings, you'll find them. basically, for each overview tab you can set up what displays on your overview and what displays in space separately. the latter defaults to everything, of course, but that can be changed. it's not something i've used(since there's nothing i'd prefer not to know about the existence of), but this is my understanding of how it works."
"we can give our support to a topic with the thumbs up that you see there<===but how about a thumbs down for those who disagree entirely with the decision.also, it would give forumers a way to abstain in a topic, something well known to those in csm closed"
"this thread has been up for a month on the same topic. it's a good suggestion, but it's a duplicate."
"at the moment, the caldari far outnumber the gallente or the minmatar, especially with the support of the amarr. however, the sides would be a lot more even if there was a chat, like the \"militia\" chat, but \"allied militia\". this would make the sides a lot more even in terms of pilot numbers, as well as current victory points.as a counter-point however, we may want to keep the factions seperate, so that 600+ player fleets aren't conceived. some of us, like myself, play eve on a laptop, and although it is a very powerful laptop, it does struggle to cope with 1200 moving ships, as well as the drones.not to mention the strain on the servers.not sure about this one myself, what do you think?"
"the sheer number of caldari pilots did make me wonder if fw participation would be lopsided. does anyone have a tally of the number of pilots aligned with each factional militia? if caldari > gallente, but (caldari + amarr) ~ (gallente + minmatar), then this is definitely a good idea.it seems to me that 600-pilot fleets engaging each other on the same grid seem somewhat unlikely to me, given the way factions claim victories."
"we are still waiting for the live dev blog which was scheduled for release just after the release of empyrean age. heck, we are still waiting for the \"we will keep you informed\" statement to be fulfilled.there has been no blog, information, announcements, or even an explanation of what the problem is.how hard can it be to get a bunch of people together to answer a few questions?!"
"please allow me to refer you to the chat logs of the third csm meeting"
"touch<U+FFFD>i did actually realise what i was saying just then. it was a sort of stab at the csm"
"oh, absolutely. i'm not saying they should ignore big issues. they could even mostly focus on those if they wanted. i'm just decrying the apparent decision to stay away from small issues."
"agreed, i don't see how an entire race's capitals being terrible is a \"small issue\".especially when they are already going to the csm about large autocannons."
"with the introduction of fw and the coming of ambulation i thought it might be a good time to introduce a content idea that hasn't been presented to the csm yet as far as i can tell. the imminent ambulation release gives it a new twist and it has content applications for fw, 0.0, hisec, losec, and would greatly enhance several aspects of the existing game.the concept is simple. a very hard to find player \"mini-base\". i'll outline a possibility of how it might be implemented and let others take it from there for the most part.1) five roids from very small to very large.a - they appear at random and only a specific number allowed in any system.b - they would require a serious and skilled effort to find.c - the smallest is the easiest to find and the largest the hardest.d - they are in deep space only and never close to existing spatial objects.2) once found the following would ensue.a - you may anchor something like a mission habitat* around it that has 'stealth' points.b - dependent on the size of the roid it could have limited pos modules anchored to it.c - once you fill your quota of modules you may activate the 'stealth' component of the habitat.d - it can now not be found according to the ratio of module stealth points to stealth emitter strength.3) while operating the following could function.a - the habitat could function as a 'private' ambulation point.b - the roid modules could be used in a normal fashion.c - the 'roid' would have a ship storage capacity in line w/size.d - its detection would open it to attack by anyone who finds it.e - the smallest might support a small covert squad or equivalent.f - the largest might support a black ops wing or equivalent.g - fuel required to operate.h - ships docked/stored undetectable.i - no effect on sov etcetera.4) if discovered...a - it becomes subject to local system security and response.b - if all modules are reduced the owners may mine out the roid.c - once the roid is gone a new one of equal class is spawned elsewhere.5) potential uses...a - covert opsb - smuggler or pirate den.c - fw forward base.d - logistics pointe - ghost travel network (if jump bridge or mini jbridge allowed)f - hangout for those in the 'know' (if ambulation is possible)comment: there are many ways this could be useful and i'm pretty sure all the mechanics (except ambulation atm) for an implementation already exist in the game. in the interest of being as brief as possible i have not commented on many other uses, benefits, and elements of just plain fun somethng like this could add to the game. i'm sure others can up their voices on that score.this only outlines a 'possible' implementation. others may well have a better way to do this or additions.*the habitat i'm referring to is the one you find in missions that has the scrolling billboard on it. maybe they would even let us customise the billboard."
"thats the rats in fw complexes (where u r capturing thingies to take eventually control of the system)"
"blue you fool!"
"yesh."
"please think about those people with red | green colour blindness - make it editable"
"anarchy!"
"csm does seem to think its a law unto its own at the moment lets hope things sort themselves out quickly"
"the csm members were elected partially based on what topics they said they would put forward to the council if elected. i say partially because i'm sure some voted due to knowing them personally rather than because of the specific issues. the number of votes that took place during the actual csm choice stage far outnumbers the votes that have been put forward for any issue in this forum (approximately 10500 votes for the csm elected positions compared to approximately 2500 for the top 15 issues on this forum). some of the csm members promised that they would raise particular issues, and i'm sure that more people would be whining that the issues they voted for in the election were not brought up if it was the case, than the number who are whining in this thread about issues that apparently haven't been voted on in this forum being brought forward. if you look at any government the people vote for those who will bring forward or represent the issues that they feel are most important, then there can be personal interaction (writing to your mp in the uk) or major protests/etc against those elected if there are a large number of people who feel a particular way which the government appears to disagree with (e.g. demonstrations against war in iraq in the uk). this forum is comparable to these \"protest\" measures, in order to get issues into the focus of the csm. the csm can choose to ignore it if they wish, or bring it up at the csm meeting, unless the 5% rule kicks in. this seems a fair system to me, and generally quite comparable to major governments, even though it is more like an advisory body to the main \"rulers\" (ccp)."
"i support this."
"you said a mouthful..."
"quite eloquent."
"the most well thought out proposal yet seen on the csm forum."
"not supported. i don't really see how what the op describes is a nerf. nor do i see how the change is in any way significant. if every tiny thing were noted in the patch notes they'd be incredibly long. personally, i find them quite long enough as is and would not welcome a huge number of inconsequential notes burying the ones that are somewhat significant and the ones that are truly significant.regards,windjammer"
"if they listed every single little change, it would be near impossible to read the patch list.hurrah! \o/"
"think of it as...1) concord have changed their policy regarding their automatic notifications.2) police in the real world are not required to send a memo to every member of the population when they change policy.3) deal with it. major changes yes, i think should be on the patch notes, but they are long enough as it is. changes like \"we have adjusted the way in which asteroid field spawn. on average, this results in an additional 0.037 veldspar asteroids in any given field\" or for that matter \"the concord thought police have started to take a more preventative stance on crime and will now issue warnings to all about to engage in criminal activity.\" i can live without.games can be too predictable - i prefer to find out things on my own than be spoonfed every little change ahead of actually experiencing it."
"truly hideous idea - so terrible in fact it'll probably get used"
"i don't know how this would even be feasible to implement."
"how exactly would multiple people shooting at the same spaceship reduce incoming damage?"
"makes the strong stronger and removes one of the major advantages you can get with less sp, a bigger gang"
"no, iirc ccp didn't want you to be able to directly generate more isk out of thin air with skills."
"we all know pos shooting isn't fun when you are steamrolling an alliance but it is still more fun then being support whose job is sitting on the gates waiting for someone daft enough to jump through, i feel that small ships should have an important role in taking down a system even if it is a niche roll.-solution-changes to cynojammers, cynojammers and jumpbridges can only be anchored around the sun of the solar system. only one of the two can be anchored so an alliance will have to choose which one the system will have, this also gives different systems different strategic values.cynojammers can only anchor large guns with poor tracking and have a damage bonus so that it makes attacking a cynojammer in anything bs or larger suicide. thus the only way to take it down is with smaller ships. \"we count 30 rebel ships lord vader. but they are so small that they are evading our turbolasers.\" \"we'll have to destroy the ship to ship. get the crews to their fighters.\"this will also give smaller alliances with small capital fleets a better chance of defending their space and it will mean that the smaller ships in the attacking fleet are directly contributing with the system takedown. cynojammers would also have to prevent people from cynoing out of a system so that defenders can't just capital blob the attackers with no risk. or make it extremely difficult to turn on and off cynojammers."
"csm is already proposing changes to sov warfare. gtho of this forum.not supported."
"sweet. can you hear the epic whining when the cruiser/bc fleet gets doomsdayed into submission?"
"agreed. it'd just be funny and yet sad to see someone collecting the immense amount of minerals for a dread/titan, then the tech 2 version, especially if it failed."
"i voted for ank with one of my characters and torn soul with the other. i'm happy with both - ank has been a pretty awesome secretary so far, and just because torn soul got voted *just* outside the alternate list doesn't mean i regret the vote. her platform was right for whichever one of the characters it was that voted for her, and i'd vote for her again :)"
"im not sure if this should go in here but here goes.as the 30 an 100 day cards have been removed people who like paying with isk the play the game by getting the cards from other people cant do it without paying lots or isk.how about a way of paying isk to eve it self.like a standard rate for different amouts of time an this could go into the lottary or something like that,what do you think?"
"the whole point of the gtc's is a legal way to buy isk with rl money. a way that lines ccp's pockets with money and probably isn't going to change."
"how old is inanna zuni, seriously?you remind me of politician's who like to sit on the back bench and ***** about thoes in the 'lime light' yet if you cannot handle yourself in a mature fashion in your current 'state' i sure as hell would not want you near any kind of position of power.grow up and stop your pointless and self destructive campaign of distaine for jade which is self evident in so many of your postings and the way you say it. you don't have to go out looking for trouble, it's going to find you."
"haha this is ridiculous! jade your in a position of authority, grow up. you cant just go blatently saying that you dont like a certain player and wont listen to them because they are affiliaded to a certain alliance or corp... why dont you just go one step further and say you hate the amarr (wow eve-racism)! imagine if the prime minister of whatever country said that he didnt like black people, or people that he wasnt going to listen to christians, hed be a little screwed. whether that title actually means anything apart form a shiny little forum thing under your name is for people to decide, however sort your life out and be more discrete with your opinions regarding the biggest alliance in the game and a large chunk of the player base!"
"sorry only just read this properly. mate if you feel this way resign. you obviously should not be in any kind of authority.. ever. goons are a big part of the game and simply because they outnumber every other alliance by double means that you gonta respect them, as they must be doing something right. if they have those numbers that means they are the most popular alliance in the game. when the star fraction hits the 5k mark then you can start saying things like: \"why doesn't jade like goons?\" ask yourself truly \"what is there to like?\"\"yes, i don't like goons.live with it.\"saying stuff as above is either a massive cry for attention or the best way to get yourself zero respect from the eve player base and alienate the people you are trying to represent!"
"always these comparisons... goons are neither a race nor a religion, they are far more comparable to an organization like scientology, which stands for certain ideals (or not). they may be the largest alliance, but they still only make up a very small share of the player base.some will agree with jade and others will not, that is really all there is to it. of course everyone is free to speak their mind about it (people tend to do that in politics :) ), but it's not appropriate to speak for the entire eve population or to claim a general moral high ground."
"wow. sorry im not going to post anymore because reading around it looks like jade just doest give a 5hit. jade, stop posting for about 4-5 days then post on one of these threads something like:\"im appologise for any misconceptions... i have my own personal opinions, however i will representat all opinions by every entity within the eve community to the best of my abilities regardless of the alliance they are in\" respect begates respect mate and if you dont humble yourself a little then your destroying alot of time and effort ccp have put into csm. embaressing yourself and them by delegitimizing the very aim of the csm scheme. csm is relatively new and needs to gain the trust of the people before it is able to say that it speaks for the people, whos to say that you wont start hating kia or mm next? youve got to be objective now that you are in authority. hit me up in game if u wana chat further about this."
"six of the nine csm members met in person today and walked into the ccp offices for an initial chat. it went well and nobody killed anyone else. there may have been a moment or two where this was in doubt, but it passed. tomorrow we will be getting down to the first day of discussions on the topics - raised by pilots - which we are bringing to ccp and the devs for their response. inanna zuni(the other three members are en route and expected here shortly; their flights were due in only during the last hour)"
"****...i don't think anyone brought up eve tv :( including me...bah well i won't douple post i'll leave my idea about eve tv here.ok the reason why ccp didn't have it downloadable for money was the fact they didn't want people stealing it. however the novel is coming out ad i give it 2 weeks untill a pdf comes out. why? because there are groups of non-eve players that do this. my point? ccp needs to look at eve tv the same way you would look at a novel. you can make it downloadable, or have an optional high rez pay for download or downloadable extras. sure peopel will steal iit and torrents will fly, but the people donwloading these torrents wouldn't of paid for them anyways. hell i don't mind 2$ a week i just want a copy of what i pay for. in other words a free versions of eve tv and a longer higher rez version.ust like the novel it will be stolen you can't get out of this fact, welcome to the internet. however everyone that can spare a buck or 2 a week will. and the rest will watch eve tv with ads, which is a little cash.so i'm sorry for the rant but maybe... i don't know it just had to be brought up :/unless i'm missing something and it was brought up :)p.s.(another idea for eve tv would be to let the embeded reporters get a spot on the show for the fw reports.also there is nothing wrong with releasing only one episode a month."

"i think the perfect inelasticity in the rare moon minerals at high demand is a real problem. in the real world, there are very few commodity goods that have this profile. the only one i can think of is the european markets for carbon credits with their hard caps on total emissions per country.i can't think of a natural commodity that has this restriction. gold for example doesn't. as the price of gold increases, new deposits and the remnants of old deposits become economical to mine. this introduces a modest amount of elasticity into the market. in modern mines, a variety of resources are generally extracted, not just the one that the mine is open for. so for example, the differences between copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and silver mines (a common grouping of elements in western us mining) often are the relative concentrations of these elements in the ore. a number of uranium mines usually have other raw materials in useful quantity (coal and radioactive decay products of uranium and thorium, for example).i favor the introduction of ways to extract at these trace amounts of minerals. maybe even have some present in high sec space. i'm think random amounts about 1-10 units per hour (with the appropriate mining array) for one or more moon minerals per moon.then on the production side, it makes no sense that designs continue to use rigid amounts of minerals. there are a number of ways cheaper materials get snuck into real world goods. akita seems to have a good way to simulate that effect in eve. i approve of it."

"the balance point is:cerberus should be able to hit a vaga, but cause minimal to 0 dmg on an interceptor.the problem with this concept is that a vaga in orbit goes at speeds close to interceptors, and inties with mwd turned on has the signature of a cruiser.so a little tweak to that could be something like the explosion velocity getting a bonus when hitting targets with sigs larger than the missile itself.this would be an indirect boost to tp as well ^^"

"captials are pushing out sub capitals because everyone (sooner or later) will be able to fly them. the first thing a new player wants to do is train for the biggest baddest ship. of course years of experience in eve teach them otherwise but that is everyone's initial feeling when they first start playing eve. with skills, training converges to everyone being able to do everything given enough time. the real question is why not be in a dread when it gives so much boost to the ego if nothing else. further anyone who actually stayed in eve long enough to fly dread and fly it well wont really want to be in anything else. also, if sub caps are being crowded out thats only because new players aren't joining fast enough to fill the lower ranks. the higher the tip of the pyramid the more base needed to support it and players just aren't joining fast enough to fill that base. if anything ccp needs to do a better job of getting more new players, unless they don't think their tech can handle it... ;d"

"its not a bs so no bonusesand carriers get bonuses for carrier so thats a no"
"then what's the point of the requirment other than to milk money from you? it's worthless."
"it's for balance. by forcing capital pilots to train their racial bs v, ccp reduces the number of capital pilots, making those pilots rarer and more valuable to corporations and alliances, as it should be. the \"bonus\" for a capital pilot training bs v is that you get to fly capitals.unless there's a game balance reason why a given capital ship is not adequately performing its mission profile, ships shouldn't be given arbitrary buffs.sorry, no support."
"so basically you are saying that it should take bs 4 to get itno teh next size ship like frig 4 is prereq to cruiser and cruiser 4 is prereq to bs? i can certainly see why frig and cruiser v as prereqs seems a bit harsh. could you explain what your preferred level is and why you fell it is too high a little more. i think i can see your point but before i thumb you i want to be a litle more certain."
"this is kind of like asking why a cruiser doesn't get a bonus for having the frigate skill. a carrier is not a tech 2 battleship. different classes of ships don't carry weight forward from the previous class."
"it's a requisite, not a relevant spaceship command skill. this would be like complaining that racial cruiser skills don't help your battlecruiser, or racial industrial skills don't help your freighter. and speaking as someone who is probably going to be training capitals in the next several months, i wouldn't want it reduced. capitals aren't supposed to be for the faint of heart, or the low of sp. the perfect battleship pilot takes a billion isk and a month to qualify for capitals, and that's about as it should be."

"currently, it takes 7-8 days (not sure exactly how this works) for a sov4 capital to drop to sov3 when a station system is taken in the consov area. this often results in a rather boring delay, as it's quite possible for both the sov3 stations to be taken within several days, then a wait to assault the sov4 station which often won't be defended. thus, i belive the contesting period in a constellation sov area is excessively long, and should be reduced to two days at most, if not removed entirely."

"\losei do full time production in empire, but i accept the risk of being suicide gank. it's been part of the game for years. if i do get suicide gank, then it's my fault for not getting a scout to see if gates are clear(ish). their is already cons to suicide ganking, first you lose your ship. when ever you lose a ship insurence helps but it never covers the full cost of the ship. next, you sec rating goes down. thus you'll have to spend your time bring it up. while you may be making money doing this, if you're into ganking then you are most likely not going enjoy ratting. this game isn't wow, we don't have pve servers. we got pvp server that has some pve aspects in it, if you don't want to get gank. max out the low slots of your ship with wrap stabs and don't go into lowsec. i don't see why you want to play a game with zero risks and you can't lose. the change to insurence seems like a cheap blow to gankers to make it more of a lost to the efforts they spend just so some people can make more profit and watch tv as they run missions."

"i support this topic"
"i find myself rather surprised at how few people have spoken up in support, knowing that at least 75% of the people i talk to in eve heavily dislike the nano mechanic. i'm also surprised at how restrained and few the nano supporters have been.in any case, in regards to jade's statement that nanos are needed because of other current mechanics, let me reply with an analogy.a man is dying of two terrible, terminal diseases. he's been to the hospital and the doctors are still arguing about the best method of saving him. so far, he has survived past all expectations, as both diseases are normally fatal within a much shorter timespan. nevertheless, the doctors have the know-how to save the patient, that much is not in doubt, but they disagree on the specific treatments. several doctors advocate treating one of the diseases first and several are proponents of treating the other. what they fail to realize is that not only are the diseases fighting the patient, but they're also fighting each other. the patient has survived this long because the diseases keep each other in check, but, were one of the diseases to be successfully treated and the other not, the patient would rapidly deteriorate further and die. thus, the optimal solution is to deal with both at the same time.it is much the same with nanos and blobbing/capitals/sov. nanos counter the blob to an extent, but the blob also counters nanos by allowing you to bring more ships that can catch and pin down the nanoers and thus allow you to bring your dps to bear, killing not just one or two but the majority of the nano gang. take away nanos and it will be very difficult to go on a roaming op through hostile space in 0.0 (but at least empire wars would become more enjoyable). take away the blob, and nanos will reign supreme as players continue to choose the little risk option and kill the fun for everyone who doesn't enjoy nanoing themselves.just like in the analogy, if you solve one without solving the other you end up with a dead patient - it will either be nanos online everywhere or there will be little non-blob/non-cap pvp out in 0.0. either way, ccp will end up losing subscriptions. ccp will also lose subscriptions if time continues to pass and nothing is done. as an example, i've been on the fence regarding my account status for some time.bottom line: the solution to the entire mess is to fix nanos and blobs/sov/capitals at the same time. this thread exists to garner support for dealing with the nano part, but it would be better if both issues were dealt with together.(that said, if i had to choose just one of the two for ccp deal with, i would choose nanos - after all, without fun 0.0 there are still highsec empire wars, lowsec piracy, and fw. without blobs/sov/caps you'll still have nano gangs everywhere and they'll be harder to counter.)p.s. for the folks who have been posting supporting a reduction to nanos, click yer damned \"support this\" option when you post!"

"lol, you started eve after nanos came about, didn't you? i'm assuming this is your alt, of course, because the windjammer character has been a member of an npc corp since he was created 10 months ago.you see, when the speed tanking buff happened, it marginalized pretty much every other playstyle and made it pointless to fly most other classes of ship in fun roaming gangs. you, of course, would never have had the experience of how much more diverse and fun the game was before nanos came about, so you wouldn't know any better.now, before nanos were buffed, there will still a few speed tanking ship, though not many. one of them was the vagabond, and, even though it only did about 3km/s, everyone wanted one. this was in the days before invention, and the limited supply resulted in extremely high prices for them that reaches upwards of 250 million each at one point. at the speeds the were capable of, vagabonds were perfectly balanced. they weren't so fast that they were effectively invulnerable in almost every situation, able to disengage with 100% reliability, though they could often escape tight situations which would've killed just about anything else aside from a 'ceptor.what i'm asking in this thread is a return to those days when speed tanking was still viable for certain ships, but speeds were slow enough that the speed tankers' advantage wasn't so overwhelming that it was pointless to fly anything else.now, in regards to your sarcastic comment, you seem to be laboring under the impression that i can't fly anything expensive and, in fact, don't own any such ships. let me give you the list of tech ii ships i can fly:caldaricovert opsassault shipsinterceptorshacsreconscommand shipsblack opsmatarihacsreconscommand shipsblack opsamarrhacsreconscommand shipsnot tech ii, but i can also fly (and own) both caldari carriers and dreadnoughts. oh, and i have over 100 kills with my non-nano machariel, which is worth several billion isk.you mean the day other ship classes become viable in combat will make eve too dull? you definitely never played before nanos - you saw a lot more diversity back then than you do now."
"yeah, yeah. long list of things you can do. good for you. i did not say you could not, i said you did not want to. i choose to believe you can do everything you say you can and have been around for as long as you say you have. this has not given you wisdom and apparently it has not given you insight. what it apparently has given you is a bad case of future shock and a tendency to moan about the good old days.perhaps they can come up with another version of eve for you. eve classic. then you wouldn't have to change ever again. then you wouldn't have to call for the game to be nerfed to mediocrity. then you wouldn't have to widen your sight a bit more. oh, and perhaps you wouldn't have to suggest that people whom you assume haven't been around for as long as you don't have a right to post against your suggestions.windjammer"
"what about a new variation of a t2 destroyer that can launch instead of warp disruption bubbles, webbing bubbles?i don't think the problem is the speed, i think it's the ability to catch them."
"i don't really understand your logic. you say the op's problem is that he doesn't want to play a certain way, implying that he should have to. that seems to be at odds with calling for variety?i don't claim to be an expert on this issue, so i'm just observing the points raised by both sides. my own experience is that the homogenisation towards speed ships creates a certain monotony that is not particularly enjoyable for many players, but i also understand that my own experience is just a very small part of the whole picture.what bothers me about these ships is not so much their effectiveness (so far i would agree that the risk justifies the effectiveness and there are plenty of counters), but rather that it's close to impossible to force a nano ship to stay in a fight, especially without flying minmatar. any other ship class always runs the risk of being entangled in a fight and then either has to win swiftly or fear that reinforcements will arrive which tear it apart. a nano ship, as far as i can tell, can always make a run for it, if it's just clever enough not to engage what it can't handle. almost to the extend of creating a demotivating consensual pvp environment. i do think this should only be acceptable for dedicated support ships, if at all."

"i will be in sub capitals ships for a long time. i am not the only person with this goal in mind. i can't see how capitals will completely dominate warfare as we know it. they aren't the new battleships nor will they be.even if they do become this, i'll adapt. will you?but yes, bring this issue up for discussion. this isn't capital ships online, but you can always tweak the system."
"this is a valid package and it absolutely must be brought up at the csm convention, there is no other way around it. as the vast majority of players out there live happily in empire, i believe that only 0.0 players will come to vote here creating a false illusion of this not being an issue."
"no support. the op's conclusions are incorrect, he misrepresents ccp's intent and his suggestions designed to primarily benefit one alliance. his. moreover, most of his suggestions fall well outside of anything ccp has suggested it might be interested in doing.the op has not quoted ccp when he says \"they feel that capitals are crowding out subcapitals\". this is his own conclusion, not ccp's. just as it was his own conclusion when he said it would make everyone a lot happier to reduce the training time to get into capitals (from the meeting minutes of the 5th csm meeting where he tried to push this and other parts of his package on the agenda......it failed).ccp simply wants to reduce a capital ships ability to do everything at once and do it well. fair enough. they made a start by reducing a carriers ability to be a cargo vessel. other proposals ccp made were met with such a fire storm of objection from the subscriber base that ccp decided to rethink the issue. several epicly long threads attested to that along with some very inventive suggestions for the demise of ccp zuulupark, the balancer credited with the carrier nerfing proposals.goonswarms goal here? simple. reduce capital effectiveness against their blobs of relatively new players recruited from the something aweful gaming group. reduce the amount of time it takes to get into capitals and the amount of time it takes to become proficient. thus they seek to minimize the advantage of established older players to make them easier for their transient new players.currently goonswarm has a problem with boredom. their players can't be counted on to maintain a sustained effort. the grow bored if they can't dominate immediately with massive numbers. and when they grow bored, they drift to other games.windjammer"
"i'm not a fan of the goons by any stretch of the word, but that's a load of crap and you know it, windy. again, it seems you never played back before nanos, capitals, pos, and sov became prevalent, just like i mentioned in my other thread.and, before you say anything, i own a chimera carrier and a phoenix dreadnought and have used them both in everything from small gang to pos and fleet warfare. can you say the same of your qualifications to speak on the matter?"

"although as the goon points out i do remember to cloak more often now, i see only three viable options for this problem.1) change it back2) change the new hull into something less ugly. my god the raven looks better than this piece of crap and that thing makes my eyes bleed.3) let me cloak in station so i don't have to look at that hideous pile of trash all the damn time."
"actually i just think they should just redesign the imicus completely, rather than change it back to a maulus, which already has one tech 2 hull.diversity ftw, no support from me."

"most of you are aware of a fact that once there was concord agents. but because of fast security standing increase they are not part of eve anymore but this topic is not about past. never should any idea which was implemented even briefly in game be abandoned. mutations are key of development. my proposal is very simple:1. return concord agents to new edenagents will offer only kill missions...100% kill missions. - if you ask \"why?\" only kill missions, one of devs before few years stated \"it just doesn't make sense to give you a sec rating boost for ferrying garbage.\"2. players will need at least security rating 5.0 or higher in order to use concord agents. but this high standing in eyes of concord will not only grant you ability to use agents, who just maybe would have in lp store some concord bpcs, and premade ships (for a reasonable price ofc.)it will also grant you right by law, that you with 5.0 standing can attack in high security space all players who did something \"wrong\" (-0.1) and concord will not blink. (all other existing game mechanic will remain, so if you really want to shoot on that helpless pod, you can.. but concord will react, blow you etc...)3.because of huge popularity which would draw many players from all sides of new eden in order to grasp on new lp rewards there is need for some balance:concord agents will not give any isk reward. only lp reward. mission rats will have same loot table like other mission rats."

"naybut yay if you lower the sec you can attack in high sec to -0.5"
"makes hot locking wtz ships very frustrating. as someone who has specialised in catching nano haulers it is a big nerf for me. it can be overcome as it is still possible to lock pretty much anything quicker than it is possible to scan it but it has raised the cost significantly and made misses a lot more likely. maybe ganking needed a nerf but this was not the way to go."
"i doubt this particular issue would ever affect me adversely (the opposite, in fact) but i'm of the opinion that the user interface should never be an obstacle to the player, if at all possible. if ccp wants high-sec ganking to be more difficult, there are better ways to go about it.on the other hand, if this is meant to protect people from an accidental concordokken, the better way would be to make it so this message can be suppressed, but to bury the option somewhere in an options menu with some sort of explicit, dire warning attached to doing so."

"your 1st example:well i think the blueprint mechanic is there as for the sake of game play. after the initial investment, any player can build a raven battleship. same thing with the blueprint copy mechanic.i believe in the past that blueprint copies were in fact, infinite runs, and they were phased out in the name of balance. you could say that a blueprint copy is like a textbook that had been photocopied and printed with ink that fades away when exposed to the elements (the rigors of production for example).2nd example:we need to realize this is in fact a game, and those \"mysterious\" changes are due to make the game balance. unfortunate, yes, but you can't expect a game that has a lot of tactical variety to be balanced from the start. there are so many more players than developers, it impossible for them to conceive the amount of combinations that the player base will seek in their quest to best other players. yes, its unfortunate and i'm sure nobody likes doing it, but you have to maintain a semi-balance.the questions1. we are immortals. we individually command the power to financially back entire solar systems, wealth that would make a thriving planet system with billions of workers pale in comparison. this is again a game play mechanic, much of this game and the mmo genre is about escapism. you don't want to be mopping the deck on an armageddon, you want to set the battlefield a light with lasers. you can serve the navies, both in militias and running agent missions.2. not entirely sure, but a pod piloted ship is a better interface to pilot a ship than a traditional bridge crew.3. where would they go? if it was your mission to kill that npc and they warped to safespotted and cloaked, then what?4. the amount of isk you would pay them would be minimal. iirc even 2-4 isk is the equivalent of a planetside fortune. i'd presume they'd come from planets at their chance to be aboard a starship amongst immortals.5. gameplay mechanics. how the insurance companies in eve stay in business requires a suspension of disbelief however.6. cloning technology is incredibly expensive, why would you clone a non-pod pilot who has 1/10000000th of the latent potential. these people aren't piloting battleships by the will of their mind.7. who knows. where do the endless hordes of npcs come from to populate providence belts, or busy empire mission hubs?8. people are weird. the internet allows them to mask who they are in rl.9. you do know how to do a lot of things. warping, navigation, activating modules, operating scanners, targeting, even things such as docking protocols to get inside stations. this would be the equivalant of flight school for years.you can't make eve mirror every single aspect of real life. a lot of your questions and solutions addressing that they aren't \"realistic\" would have far reaching consequences to game play, rendering it practically unplayable. eve rp is very achievable, but you have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy them sometimes. it is a quirk of sci-fi themed games/media."

"as a fairly new user, i found the 30 day option helpful to see if i would really stay the course within eve online. once those 30 days were up, the 90day gtc offered value for money so i went ahead and paid for 90 days worth which i am currently using. for me in the uk, paying under <U+FFFD>8 a month for eve was rather good. let's see how this translates, especially with the increase inthe us dollar recently:30 day = $14.95 = <U+FFFD>7.5790 day = $38.85 = <U+FFFD>6.55 (per 30 days x 3)so at this point you have a short term package for the undecided or those who don't need 90 days, and a long term package which offers better value for money as reward for long service.60 day = $34.99 = <U+FFFD>8.85 (per 30 days x 2)this new card doesn't compete with either card, blows the limit on what i want to pay per month and is just plain profiteering. the excuse that ccp wants to reduce confusion does not roll as this sudden change only increases confusion and covers up blatant profiteer for those who can't look at the sums like me.as such i no longer see eve online as an option and will not be renewing till i can pay the same as i already have per month.as for staying competitive...wow-us 60 day timecode = $29.99 = <U+FFFD>7.58 (per 30 days x 2)ccp just priced itself out of my online gameplay needs.(usdgbp forex used for conversion from:"

"thumbs down. this program simply takes a piece of information that is already being outputted to the client and presents in a more noticeable manner. i fail to see anything wrong with that. as far as abusive exploits go, it's about as \"bad\" as customizing your overview to make enemies easier to notice and target.a good user interface works for the player, and that means the player should have a lot of control over how info is displayed. if the player is allowed access to a particular bit of info (such as the fact that a hostile has entered local, or that a particular ship is using a warp scrambler on him, or anything else) should be presented in virtually any manner that player desires -- via sound effect, text popping up in the middle of the screen, a line of text in a log, whatever.i feel it's pretty stupid that keeping your eyes on a chat channel is an available (and necessary) tactical precaution anyway. it's bad for immersion, and borders on what we call \"meta-game thinking\" in pen and paper rpgs. having the option of finding or recording an aurora sound-alike voicing \"enemy detected in system\" or, failing that, a simple warning tone, is far better for maintaining a sense of immersion than watching the chat channel. if the \"local\" channel were eliminated and and replaced with with some other mechanism of detecting other ships in system (perhaps tied in some manner to your ship's sensor capabilities), that might be fine by me, but as long as local is the method of keeping an eye on system traffic, the player should be allowed have that info display however he likes."
"ccp knew the large corps were using this type of program for a while by their own admission. they only decided to take action when it became public domain.so they stepped in and removed its use in the public domain.and as before, someone within a large subscription block will figure a way to do this again and ccp will find out but it wont be a problem till the other players of eve get ahold of it."
"[ i posted this originally in the \"features and ideas discussion\", it was suggested i get it into here too ]after playing eve on and off for over a year, i have collected a list of suggestions which i will lay out all together here. some of these i am sure will seem insignificant, but i think they add up in the end.system scanner:- bottom buttons should be on opposite sides - not so close to each other (accidental analyze happens to me too much) left side: analyze; middle: new scan; right: view result. this format moving the next button in line to a different location in a dialog is an excellent method of reducing user error by design.overview:- [fixed] sorting by icon does not seem to work between stations and stargates (mixed sort). example system aramachi.- overview setting seems to reset to default too easily (from saved type)edit location:- modifying a bookmark subject does not allow pressing enter to complete (must click 'ok')right click menu:- in many locations very bad options are placed next to commonly used options - for example, \"remove station from overview\" and \"dock\" in the right click station menu. these should be separated, immensly. grouping with a separator would be appropriate. group one: ship actions; two: travel; three: bookmark, info; four: overview config (remove type)- it seems that a good amount of network traffic could be cut down by adding second tier menu's to the left panel buttons, similar to the accessories button. if i could select assets->solar system when my last assets view was \"all regions\" i can avoid the all regions query.manufacturing quote:- the manufacturing quote does not show the blueprint, making screenshots less informative.- sorting corporate blueprints in the science and industry dialog by copy or me or pl doesnt seem to work properly.- display the current number of jobs processing next to max 8 (3 active)travel- reaching a waypoint manually could prompt a vocal / textual notice (waypoint reached)containers:adding buttons next to the \"icons, details, list\" buttons for sort by and stack items.jukebox:- i have music set to zero, when i open the jukebox it is always in play for which i have to click stop. it may effect nothing, but a clear \"no music\" would remove any doubt.misc:- mouse over current time for full date+time (when left panel minimized)- the tilde (perhaps only in my resolution?) is almost indistinguishable from a minus sign- solar system map: when hovering over a group of items (bookmarks, moons, planets) the list will display in non-visible location (upward overlapping edge of display)- how about some horizontal scroll bars - for example on the scanner? having to stretch the interface to see the right side is very limiting.- it would be nice to get the agent show info from the right click menu in journal->agents->missions (and perhaps also add waypoint.- can we have some ircd like commands in the chat window/join <channel> open new chat window with channel. (removing the need to open the channels & mailing lists dialog, etc). in keeping with my previous suggestion - a 2nd tier menu would be ideal, two items, the normal dialog and a text box (perhaps even a recent list).- something that would help with bookmarks is to group them by region and constellation- an option to have targeted ships remain in their position on the screen rather than roll towords the \"selected item\" box would be very helpful, especially given how laggy some systems can be.- target boxes and positional lines should be a color that is distinguishable from the tactical overlay lines- colore damage messages according to the type (incoming at least right?)- emphasize the amount of damage and attacker with bold or color offset- allow damage message window in hud (not log!) to be single line and fade outanyhow - that's my 2 cents for now.hope dev finds it useful =)-raylon"

"listen, there's nothing wrong with one alliance trying to control the supply of dysprosium and/or promethium, just like there's nothing wrong with one country in the world trying to do the same for oil, uranium, gold, aluminum, balsa wood, fuzzy dice or whatnot. doesn't mean in the real-world any country that's trying to has a real chance of doing that at all in the first place (just look at wars fought over oil for nearly as long as combustion engines became mainstream) because of how exactly the resources are spread over a country, the needed infrastructure for extraction and the way how territory is held by nations, or, if they do manage to do that through a serious combined political and military effort, doesn't mean that occupancy will matter much in the long run as alternative means to get the same results are introduced (even if it's more expensive than the \"original\" used to be, it's cheaper the alternate way \"now\").what is wrong however is that in this game, you do have more than a real chance of controlling the dysp/prom supply (and not even with a lot of effort) thanks to screwed up pos mechanics, strontium micromanagement and hot-dropping capital fleets at the same time sov level not mattering at all in mining speeds... and you have no chance of alternative means of reaching the same results unless ccp manually introduces them.since this is a game, you have two choices : you either make it almost identical to the real world (by introducing a lot more of the checks and balances that exist \"naturally\") and let it sort itself out, or you sacrifice realism almost completely and grab in, making some radical changes for the sake of gameplay.contrary to what you might have thought so far (and probably still do), this thread does not advocate the latter course of action, but the former.revamping the moon mining system (different concentrations and therefore extraction rates, trace elements in nearly every moon, even making sov matter and so on) and/or introducing alternative reactions to use a whole lot more common materials and none (or very little) rare ones to manufacture all advanced components, this all ties in with making the game (and therefore, inherently, the game's market too) \"more realistic\"."
"akita t has not provided any non-opnionion based arguments in the thread linked in the op. in other words: this idea is so far only supported by akita t's own personal opinions."
"don<U+FFFD>t think so.full support. and thanks for this very educating discussion. i have learned a lot through this.industry with greater flexibility and more options sounds good."
"he's right, of course.ccp should add ersatz to the economy. industrialists should be able to produce synthetic dysprosium, just like real world industrialists have been able to produce synthetic fuel for 70 years."
"fine, be that way then.it is my personal opinion that risk in this game should be proportional (not much higher, not lower either) to the potential reward. if you don't share that opinion, not my problem, and you're free to disagree. you've stated as much, repeatedly, without providing a significant backing as to why my opinions are wrong and yours are better.based on that particular opinion of mine with regards to risk-vs-reward (which, in my opinion, should be and is shared by a lot of people playing and, again, in my opinion, is also shared by the developers of this game), i merely observe how things are not that way, not in the world of ore mining, not in the world of moon mining either.as a direct consequence of my own, personal opinion on what should be on top of my observations of how it isn't, i came up with a few (more than just a few, quite plenty actually) options of how things could be handled (and it's not even limited to the possible solutions i've listed) in order to restore (what in my opinion were and should be) the proper magnitudes for possible rewards when taking potential risks and effort needed into consideration for both moon mining and regular ore mining.better now ?"
"honestly akita t, enough with the stuff quotes.first paragraph you say, yes i agree with brainless bimbo, alliances can use, abuse, the market in thier interests, they can engage in market and gunship pvp to limit supply and maximise profit as its a free market.second paragraph is jumbled, so jumbled that it doesn't really make sense, are you waffling on about americian empire policy?, and the transitory nature of nation state empires. (side note: oil was actually a replacement good and will soon be replaced by what it replaced, weird thought huh!) third paragraph says that the free market in eve and the ability of alliances to control resource sources which continue production even when they are under attack isn't fair, is wrong, end of story.forth paragraph says regulate the market or destroy the game by making changes.last paragraph says akita t wants market regulation, wants existing attributes and the infrastructure attached to them to be changed, and start making uranium out of lead, silicon and boron because akita t thinks its more realistic.now come on akita, you can't even explain or defend your position let alone the presumptions you needed to make it.oh regards your reply to capt fina; look reward and profit are two different concepts, you get high rewards in low / null sec but that doesn't mean you make high profits, cost and profits are linked to the market and will always be changing the risk / reward ratio, if you can't see that plz remove your head from the bucket its in."
"congratulations on your first post ever."
"the only thing not making any sense here is you.how about you put something that resembles a brain between the bimbo ears and let it marinate in the post you quoted for a while, maybe you will finally make some sense out of it. yes, it's not written in the most concise and elegant manner possible, but you can't expect me to even try and keep it at a high-school reading level all nice and tidy with bullet lists and all after you have repeatedly proven you're incapable of assimilating the ideas of that kind of writing either (as opposed to just being able to comprehend the words therein and understanding whatever it is you wanted to understand in the first place anyway, in spite of any efforts to educate you of the contrary).if not, don't worry, i need a laugh every now and then too, so keep posting anyway... or maybe i will amuse myself with movies of cats hitting on flashlight-lit walls, the entertainment type and quality is of a similar level."
"oh my, i'm dismayed by all the thumbs-up to this idea.there is no problem with mineral prices, or distribution, in my opinion. the prices are the current appropriate balance of willingness of the pilots in eve to trade their time between mining, running missions, and fighting to keep those moon mining stations running.the only economic problem i've been able to identify in eve is that the money supply is not tied to material wealth; this is the same problem that threatens real-world economies. tying available isk into actual wealth (i would really cry if people think that isk is the same thing as wealth) would solve most of the economic problems.mineral prices being low or high is neither good nor bad - it is a market balance. we do not have any say - and probably ccp doesn't even care - about what the prices \"should be.\" this is almost as bad as saying we know what the weather \"should be,\" we know what we want but there is nothing that says what things \"should be.\" the most i'll guess is that ccp has an idea of how many man-hours they want it to take to achieve certain goals.i understand that there is some interest in being able to use alternative materials for construction to offset the inability of certain pilots to get the materials they want: the mechanism in the game to get those minerals already exists, and it's called getting into combat. unless it's not possible through combat or whatever, the system is not 'broken.' (the other issue is that it makes no sense at all to be able to use alternative materials for existing items, and the complexity of allowing equivalent but alternative items is probably beyond tenable.)i see this whole debate as \"i don't want to have to fight for my minerals,\" or \"other people got the minerals first, so it's hard to get them for myself,\" which may or may not be accurate. however, it seems to me one of the guiding principles of eve is that you have to fight for your survival here, and there aren't any \"easy\" ways to get what you want. if there are moons that make profit and you want it, go take the moons. if other people have them and protect them, well, so be it.i do not support the idea of changing any balances like this until isk is tied to wealth; otherwise everything is just treatment of a symptom rather than treatment of the cause."
"so you find it perfectly acceptable that this game, has little to zero scale and what you started off doing in the game at day one as an industrialist, is what you'll be doing at day zero when you decide to either pvp mission run or quit...interesting.you would think any industrialist worth their weight in brains would recognize that the argument is being made to create a more defined reward scale.fact. there is no point to mine low sec.fact. there is no point to min null sec.why?when you factor in the risk against your reward, what little you come out ahead is not worth the headache.....either people really are this clueless to game design, or we're arguing against macro miners akita... i'm convinced of it now."
"i was going to write a large dissertation () on this post, but decided to take my own advice i was writing and look at different perspectives.at the crux of the matter we have a group of people in eve who run around shooting each other, whose reward is either holding as much space as they can or having the best k/d ratio. others' reward is having the highest wallet, or the fastest-growing wallet. yet others' are to be able to run missions the fastest, or destroy markets, or create markets...the list is as varied as the pilots.for instance, the guy who visited every system in eve took a guaranteed chance to be blown up numerous times for the reward of being the first documented person to visit every system. there are others who are attempting to obtain one of every item in the game. how can an \"objective\" or \"balanced\" risk/reward system be placed on something that is inherently subjective?this is why i don't like the discussions on risk vs reward: there is no way, without pigeonholing people into a \"the most of this type of point only wins\" scenario, you can control or balance or <insert other appropriate verb here> such a thing. so if you want your sandbox, you're not going to have \"balanced\" risk vs reward, because those (balance and freedom) are mutually exclusive in my observation."
"not suported.but additional means for freighters to reduce risk needs to be looked at imo. people that want to make changes in eve by enhancing game-mechanics/-rules and/or npcs makes me a sad panda."
"i do not support this issue.suicide gankers are not targeting 'decently fitted ravens.' pimp my ride boats are the targets and rightfully so. there should be a risk when you undock anywhere in eve in your 5bil isk raven. this is not wow, toning down such aspects of the game will make it less appealing to a good number of people."

"agreed. speed needs to be reviewed."
"absolutely agree with definition of the problem."
"i agree speeds broken only becsue the things that counter speed are broken, fix webs and neuts so the huge gap between their range and the current orbiting range a nanno has to have to keep you scramed are brought closer together again. t2 disruptors and overheating have moved speedy ships out of the range of their intended counters, webs/neuts. bring them up to speed with speed and its a fix, no need to nerf speed. it needs to be looked at for sure. good luck csm's"
"i think you misread me. i stated that even with your proposed changes, the intie would still be the better t2 frigate compared to the assault frig.the idea of making af to t1 frigs, what hac are to t1 cruisers is a good one, if we wouldn't already have viable combat t2 frigs in the form of inties.you'll need another incentive to use them. perhaps a bonus that makes them less affected by webs or something."
"i dont support nerfing nanos, i cant stand them, but i dont support nerfing them either. but, they need to have counters that actually work, webs and neuts (med neuts not bs sized) should be brought up to speed. they have always and should alays be the main counters to nanos, but they got left behind. as the minimum orbiting range of nanos has increased the maximum range of webs and neuts hasnt increased enough to counter them."

"son of a a*****... nano-whining again?here let me just help you out as little... howe to kill every nano ship out there.1) killing vagas/all nano ships. -use a rapier/huginn to slow it down. -use a curse to suck its cap dry, cant go mwd with no cap. -get a few interceptors on it (crows are really fast) using a falcon to jam it, and slow it down, then blow it up.2) killing ishtars. -kill the drones. ishtar then runs away cause it now sucks. but, get the above mentioned ships on it and bam, it dies.is your bs fleet going to kill a group of good nano-ships? no, probably not unless the nano pilot screws up. but can nanos kill a rr bs gang? not a chance in hell. if you dont want to fly nano, but you do want to kill them, bring a mixed fleet. get a few interceptors, grab some recons and a few hacs, they dont have to be nano'd. smart flying and using tactics can stop a nano ship[ in its tracks, it is much more likely if you stay together, send out the inties to tackle and jam with falcons, you will live thorugh the encounter.there now stop whning and adapt."
"supporting this.ccp needs to address this issue fast or everybody jumps on the nano bandwagon (and i really mean everybody) and the same situation like the announced carrier/mom nerf arises, when a gigabtic blob thread altered (or delayed) ccps decision."
"range is not enough. agility mod needs to be addressed as well.see nyphur address this here"
"i support. just think of how stupid something the size of a nuclear aircraft carrier accelerating to 5000+ meters per second in little under a few seconds is. lets say that's about 1000 m/s^2, which is a killer 100gs: 10 times more than any human can withstand without being turned into chunky salsa. in fact even the space shuttle, despite the 12mn (that's meganewtons, the same unit of measure that the mwd and ab use; essentially the space shuttle has a cruiser sized ab fitted) that its engines put out, it only accelerates at a slow 3 gs.basically the speeds are fine imo, its the rate at which you can alter your speed that needs to be changed. i think that the easiest way to do this is to increase the mass penalty to mwd.edit: typos.edit2: to give you a better comparison of the size of things involved here checkout these two links:"
"in case you hadn't noticed, eve physics =/= rl physics."

"i agree and/or support this idea."
"wall of text coming in hot!!!!alright my take on capitals. i cant fly one, but i love them. i love being in a corp that will hotdrop them on people or stranded single capitals. i love seeing them dropping onto grid as pilots flee and i love being in an inty and having 5 fighters assigned to me.but.. i think there should be some changes. but i dont think there should be changes to the capitals themselves. i think there should be changes to sub-capitals, mainly modules and a change to one insignificant ship. here is my idea.battleship modules:new class of weapon, missile/hybrid/laser/projectile all types. one for each race.the new weapons would be a modifed (t3?) version of regular weapons that could only load a special class of ammo, call them penetrator ammo or whatever, but this ammo would have huge anti-cap bonuses. such as 200% more damage to any cap ship it hits. drawbacks would be that it makes the guns track like a dread... terribly. therefore smaller ships would be immune to it but you could have a group of dedicated anti-cap bs pilots ready to go. make it cost a lot to use, awu 5 in addition to the t2 skills. it would not have any extra effect on pos's.assault frigates... little mini tank.recreate the assault frig into an anti-capital. the new bonuses will be 200% extra damage of all guns to fighters. able to fit a new module called capital warp disruptor. specifically designed to disrupt the warp and jump cores of capital class ships it acts as 2 points on all cap ships but does nothing to non-cap ships. has a range of about 10k, got to get all nice and cozy with the cap ship.able to fit a new module that dissipates the effects of a ddd. specifically a racial one, one for each race, and can reduce the doomsdays effects by preventing 99% of the damage done to the ship. still gets it into armor and possibly structure if that race module is fit, but the little guy survives to put a point on something.those are my ideas at least."
"i agree and/or support this idea."
"simple idea, add more hangars for the corporation offices. i know there's an alliance hangar thread but not everyone will benefit from that.7 hangars ins't really enough to sort up things, and using containers are well... not that fun.so simply add more hangars, 10 should be a suitable number compared to the 7 today./c"
"i'd be happy with even just one extra hangar division. i support this idea whole-heartedly. first."
"yes!"
"autopilot options needed:1. avoid enemy highsec (needed for 'safe' afk travel without having to specify waypoints every freaking time), most important2. set destination to nearest friendly highsec (needed for when you want to gtfo fast), less importantmap options needed:1. color stars by: enemy/friendly sov. space, so you can get a better overview without having to select \"show all sov.\", which usually takes a long while and colours are not sufficiently high-contrast(for instance, if you are a caldari militia pilot, amarr+caldari sov should both be displayed as blue, minmatar+gallente as red, the rest uncoloured)also, this could work for people that are not in a millitia. alliances towards which you have positive standings show up green, the negative standings show up red, the rest uncoloured2. ???3. profit!"
"cool :)"
"yarrgreed!"
"i like all of these, but if you're going to be implementing #2, then can you also implement the option to set destination to a region? i know of a lot of times i want to accept a public contract or check a market, and i have no idea of what the fastest way to get in-region is to do it."
"you're going to have this in almost any system out there (at least any i've read about). the difference is that it would be more hassle to do it this way.still, that would basically be avoided with most bounties less than 30 million isk. reason being, pirates are proud of their bounties (as are many non-pirates, though only pirates would get high bounties due to the fact that they could only be placed by people with killrights, etc.). i used to be a pirate (and plan to be again soon), and having a bounty was like the culmination of hours of work; it was physical proof that i was notorious in some way. you'll find that most pirates wouldn't want to pod themselves for their bounty.also, the timer is another way of avoiding exploitation. under this system, people couldn't simply play a different account for a week while a contract on them expired. not only that, but if you took out a contract on someone who then happened to leave on vacation, you'd have just lost a lot of money for no reason."
"as far as i can see, there's only one real way to exploit it, and i've already addressed that point. the \"big guys\" problem is simply a bi-product of the system. i have no opinion about it either way, but if you utilize the system as stated, you're going to have something like this happen. one way it could help game play is to force people that want to get the \"big guys\" to plan strategically and pool their money to make it work... perhaps a \"corp contract\" sort of thing, but that would require more balancing."
"i wouldn't pod myself for my bounty (which sucks now) no matter how high it is. i think i am in the minority though.you already popped your target, and ****ed him/her off enough to place millions of isk on your head, which then you claim for yourself. you are just costing them even more isk and grief. for some people, this is the end goal.i would not waste isk placing a bounty on somebody who can go \"hey thanks for the isk\" if he/she so choses. i think thats the only thing wrong with the current bounty system and yours."
"i don't usually do serious poasts, so bear with me:as is obvious, the amount of capitals in the game has skyrocketed over the past couple of years. as the amount of capitals has increased, so has the amount of capkills and this has led to the all too common phenomenon of capital ships self destructed to deny loot and a killmail.why is this a problem?why shouldn't they be allowed to self destruct? it's their ship right? yes, but self destructing should be a choice which is risky, whereas for most pilots now it's just a button you push when it's blindingly obvious you're going to die so that you can deny your aggressors shiny stuff, and so you're not forced to upload that embarrassing lossmail. however - the problem is not self destructing itself; it's the two minute timer. it should always be an option - but more of a risk based thing (as in, \"will help arrive in time?\"; \"is this fleet able to take me down?\" etc etc). that's not the only problem however - it actively encourages blobbing on the target in order to kill it within the time, and furthermore reduces the fun in smaller lowsec roaming gangs as these rarely have dps to finish a capital in short order. (in this situation most caps can hit self destruct when they go into hull)what do you want done?it's pretty obvious to me, make the timer longer. i would suggest a flat minimum of 5 minutes for all carriers and dreads, although frankly i'd really think it'd be better closer to 8 - 10 minutes. 10 should also be the minimum for motherships. with this, the capital pilot will be forced to choose to self destruct maybe half way through a fight (against a small gang), rather than right at the end.i think you're a talentless grieving ganker who emocries everytime you don't get your precious killmail to stare at all day.more or less."
"well it would be nice to make the timer much longer.in the end, they don't have a capital anymore and its because you and company. leave the kill board stats for the forum trolls and e-peen wavers."
"meh, good concept i just don't think it would work."
"as a sb pilot. im going togo with. no on this. to much. but i will admit i did think oh yeah! but again too much."
"our corp mates have been talking about this very thing. definitely agree."
"pirating is currently heavily stacked in the pirate/gankers' favour. unfairly so, because warp scrambling is so easy and it almost always works ).if ws didn't work so well, more people would risk going in to low-sec and, thus, pirates would probably get just the same amount of kills anyway. a win/win situation for all, no?////"
"i'll bet you've never heard of wcs."
"and how useful are they? about as much use a chocolate fireguard.all i'm saying is that it should not be so easy for pirates to do what they do. make 'em work for their ill-gotten gains!"
"and let me guess - you're a pirate?..."
"terrible idea. maybe you could introduce another module with a longer range with a 50% chance to hit, but don't change something that works as intended.all you need to survive lowsec is a little bit of smarts, watch local, watch scanner, stay aligned, make safes. bubbles don't even exist so you can travel almost with impunity in most ships."
"well, maybe the wcs should work as intended...what's a 'bubble' anyway?"
"interdictor bubble andmobile warp disruptorsthe visual effect is that of a bubbleyou are a young player obviously, you will realize soon enough that your pov is very limited and largely incorrect."
"how so? please enlighten?"
"when i stopped being a noobish idiot, i stopped losing ships in low sec to gankers. things like avoiding hot spots, watching local, keeping on the move, using my scanner, being aligned to warp if i was staying in one spot. you can even use alt scouts if you are really paranoid.keep in mind, also, if you change the warp scrambling system, your anti-pirate fleets would have a much harder time catching pirates, because the pirates will leave if they can't win. this, ironically places the advantage back to the people your absurd notion is supposed to nerf."
"no. you are supposed to have you facts together before you show and post some unqualified whine about how some pirate stole your lunch money.it is very simple on how the mechanics work. read up on the modules. and figure it out. questions you have to answer is how many points does it take to jam. and how many wcs you need to prevent it. edit: and the wcs does work as intended."
"this issue really needs more support."
"really simple, it would be pertinent to know want actions, plans, steps being taken to eliminate all the server side tech issues plaguing the game. more then the typical jita annoyances the current state is stretched thin and will get worse as new players start their experience in space. how stable is the game we vest time and money to play now, and for tomorrow? whats being done to solve the issues?thanks(side note)... i do understand ccp is a software game content publisher, not a hardware infrastructure firm like cisco systems"

"now, i've spent over four years playing other mmo's, and i found out that binding the keys would make things tremendous much easier and better. so today i wished to change a couple of keybinds on my setup, to allow me to do a lot fast. now the first thing i noticed was that there was a couple of locks, that's okay. when i wished to change f1-f5 to simply become 1-5, and the others for, well don't have to explain it all anyways, i had to choose if i wanted to use ctrl, alt or shift. then i simply gave up, cause then the keybindings would feel really unconfortable.now i know that the mouse is the main thing you need to play the game. but for those who wishes to use the keyboard for something a little more than to chat, please make the keybindings more simplified and more free."
"supported - hotkeys are the key to a good game interface much of the time. a mouse doesn't have enough commands to allow for fast gameplay, but a keyboard does. we should be able to make better use of them. of course, you'll have problems using them if the chat window is highlighted, but that's a conflict i'll tolerate."
"first - this is not about allowing alliances into fw :) actualy its about prevetning them from interfering.issue: as black rise popped in the 0.0 alliances had began the conquest for them. their numbers in black rise are increasing and they tend to shoot at militia fleets.what was beginning to look like a revolution in eve, a very successful addition that is turning loads of carebears into regular eve players ... well the progress is slowing down because of big alliances.tomorrow's incident on tama gate where gallente militia got obliterated by ra and exe is just one of many.idea: militias arent interrested in holding systems for profit - only for an advancement ang the glory of its faction :)alliances fight for them systems for profit (pos and moon mining, ratting maby, mining).now that wouldnt collide however considering what i have pointed earlier both groups fight each others.my idea is to make faction standing for alliances. when a militia pilot from ex. gallente is having his ship destroyed by an alliance x member - alliance x gets a standing hit :)now the lower faction standing the alliance has the bigger would be eventual regular retaliation task forces from the gallente faction. that means deployment of npc task forces to fight x alliances installations and any capital ships they have in the faction occupied systems.the standings would get back to normal after some time.as for militia attacking alliances with no negative standings would cause militia standings drop (as the faction dont want to have more enemies) - a bit harsh imo - maby someone can come up with better idea :)of course only the one that has initiated the aggression will be punished... and such an act would make the alliance/militia pilot flagged for like the rest of the day (no penalty shooting them).no u can comment :)"

"pre-nerf strength would be overpowered when you bring rigs and links into the picture. i don't ever want to see an 80% strength damp.i do support buffing the bonus on these ships to 7.5% though. this makes for 58% damps with skills at v, 64% or so with two rigs, 73% if you stack a mindlinked eos on top of that. i'd say that's about balanced, the ship is definitely giving something up for that power, but anything downrange of those damps will be severely hampered. 10%/level would bring back 70% damps when rigged, but bring a mindlinked eos into the picture and we're up to 80% damps, and i think most of us can agree that 80% damps are overpowered. two of those and a 250km lock range becomes a 16km lock range.rsds on bonused ships are underpowered as things stand. they should not be falcons that don't need sdas though, which is about what a 20%/level strength bonus would make them. 85% strength with max skills, and then add two rigs and you hit 93.7% damp strength. add an eos to the picture and well. . . be interesting to see how the engine handles negative lock ranges."

"reducing the cooldown time between two individual jumps will not allow you to make much better use of the jumps you have, but it will simply increase the number of jumps you can make.i'd rather see a \"48 hours since previous clone jump\" alternative method of clone jumping instead of a skill-based faster overall jumping speed.a 48h for 2 jumps (instead of 24h for one jump) limit would ensure you being able to jump somewhere, do something, then jump right back whenever you feel like it every two days... or make one jump somewhere else daily (like right now). you will not be able to make more jumps per week/month, but you will be able to make better use of the jumps you have."

"you can't balance absolutely everything in the game without more effort anybody would be willing to put in, true... but you can balance things of the same kind a lot easier.there's nothing hard about pointing a finger at what needs to be balanced in highsec/lowsec/0.0 mining, for instance.the risks are clear : in 1.0 (and 0.9 too), there's practically zero risk outside of human players, and even that risk is minimal overall due to fast concord response times. stuff you can find here is veldspar (in massive quantities) and scordite here and there, then also pyroxeres and plagioclase in 0.9 among a lot of veldspar and some scordite.in 0.5-0.8, you start getting some minimal amounts of threats from non-scrambling belt rats, plus the usual (still quite low) player risks. you start finding omber and kernite from 0.7 and below in some regions.going into 0.4, the risk from beltrats is also slightly increased, but the risk from other players skyrockets, as there's no more concord to protect you. you can find jaspet, hemorphite and hedbergite here.out in 0.0, the risk from players is potentially maximal (not that much higher than the risk in lowsec anyway, even less if done in \"home turf\", in your own alliance space, but that's a different issue), and the risk from npcs is steadily increasing as you go further down towards -1.0 truesec and the place you can find bistot/arkonor/mercoxit.one can only conclude from here veld, scor, pyro and plag should be the lowest earning ores around, with veldspar distinctly lowest of them all... and according to base prices, that's how it is.you can also conclude that jaspet and omber should be worth quite a bit more than those four, and surprise, in base price, that's how it is too.since the risks are highest for the 0.0 ores, especially those in \"deep 0.0\", obviously, bistot and arkonor should be worth most, with mercoxit quite high too (although mercoxit is a whole other issue)... and again, no coincidence, the base prices say the same story here too.now, the only reason why actually mining those ores is nowhere near what the base prices would suggest is the fact that individual minerals are too far off their own base prices, with tritanium a lot higher, and most of the rest a lot lower. and the reason why minerals are off their base price like that is the influx of highends from the drone regions (easy to move, dropped in massive quantities, not requiring a specialised mining setup at all) and the pressure to mine for tritanium locally (due to the multiple compression hauling nerfs and repeated npc refineables removal).in order to fix the balance of risk-vs-reward for mining (and for mining alone, not talkig about the rest) you'd have to do something.what you can do, now that's a whole different problem. anything from shifting ore around or changing the ore refining yields, to revamping the mining system to be system-sec-specific in actual yields, even down to changing the ratios of minerals needed (or just adding alternative recipies to existing items)... all of that can help if done right, either individually or a little bit from each.doesn't really matter which one of those things you do, or how much of it, it only matters that it's done fast and until a proper balance is acheived.___so, to repeat... it's not a balance of all subjective things one can do in eve, it's the balance of only one small aspect, a highly objective one too, namely mining income potential (with regards to the system security rationg you're mining in)."
"you amply deserve it, nay, you have been trolling for it for a long time, so i said, what the hell, hive her (or is it \"him\"?) the pleasure.heck, your entire forum persona is built for trolling alone most likely, even going only by your name.i said equally intellectually challenging to reading your posts. i was sure even you could grasp the subtle difference, but apparently, i was mistaking.i apologize to the cats.wow, talk about reading between the lines and missing the whole point entirely.ok, just for you, and just this time, again, in slow motion, and with nice kindergarten-level explanations.the strong guys of the time (doesn't matter which country, could be ancient greece or today's usa) are always trying to control some natural resource that's important right then. for instance, oil in the past 80 years or so... history is full of other similar things, just with less people involved. now, it's really hard to control a natural resource, because it does not care for national borders or other such things, so deposits of it could be scattered anywhere. finding and then getting them out needs a lot of time and effort, and the strong guys can't really keep on fighting everybody who is near where the resources are and at the same time keep extracting the resources everywhere.say the strong guys do manage to control most or even all of the resource after a lot of effort (wars to chase off those who want to control the resource, bribes to the ones leting them extract it, buy cheap from those afraid of them and so on). when they try to sell it expensively they soon find out that the whole fight wasn't all that good, because meanwhile somebody else came up with some other way to use other (cheaper, more abundant) resources to get the same results cheaper than using their \"full control\" resource price."

"since i know i can't go too far into rl politics without a gm scrubbing me afterwards, i'll just say that your opinions are bad and you should feel bad, and leave it at that."
"but what about the facts?"
"and that's all it is to you, isn't it ? a debate. you don't care about the big picture, you care about the little nitpicks. there was no straw man argument, and my only \"ad hominem\" attacks were made after all avenues for logical discourse have been eliminated, leaving me to believe i'm either dealing with a troll or an idiot, in which case the only possible arguments are ad hominem.not a single relevant and valid point has been left untouched. a lot of irelevant and invalid points have been ignored.there's less and less artificial barriers like price ceilings or bottom caps, even if there still are some, as not all npc-sold refineables have been eliminated, and insurance still bottom-caps the \"mineral basket\".if you want a truly free market, you would have to eliminate all forms of insurance *and* all npc sales of reprocessable goods.you're misinterpreting. again.the oversupply of minerals in general drives the price down until it almost hits the \"insurance fraud\" bottom cap.the relative oversupply of high ends compared to demand ratios of highends drives highend prices further down.the ease of transport of highends and the cumbersomeness of lowend hauling makes that even worse, driving tritanium up the wall and highends even further down.hey, what do you know, risk-vs-reward balance (in the sense of high/low/no sec for one) was supposed to be part of that vision !you're misinterpreting. yet again. what a surprise.no, it's not \"making highends out of lowends\", but instead it is \"making t2 components with a lot more lowends and less or no highends\".what the hell do you know about database programming in general, and eve's database in particular ? apparently, not much, if you're making such an absurd claim. you might as well request removal of several item types that are never used, since, uh, why, they clutter the database ! guess what, no, they don't \"clutter\" it in any way that it might matter.hmm, then maybe you mean cluttering it in an instanced way ? hell, why not force stack everything, since that would remove a lot of clutter too ! i mean, having ten stacks of antimatter charge m in your hangar is pretty much equally bad to having 10 different item types there anyway.this just to give you a little clue as to how far your ignorance spreads.i'm sure you won't understand it either, but who cares, i'm just making fun of you anyway.now remember that the risk-vs-reward ratios are not supposed to be dependant on anything else except (what a shocker) risk involved vs reward offered for the same type of activity done in different parts of the game universe, and that income (i.e. reward) never meant profit in the first place anyway (so why the hell did you mention that, or how is that in any way relevant to what you just said)."
"wow... what can we say... you didn't read what i've been writing have you.now, i just don't perceive your alledged problemsand here's why yet again: markets can't work too perfectly and they depend on human greed to function; the base price was the market value at the time it was taken; all price differentials are open to wild variability as its a free market (within an artificial floor and ceiling thats being eroded); reward is set by the market if the ccp created reward is accessed via the market place (selling ore or loot); and high end moon materials can and should be monopolised by alliances as its a display of thier power in eve.with a player driven market the value of all activities is infulenced by others actions and not by ccp who just provide the availability (roids, rats, drones and moons) and buffers (floor and ceiling values of raw materials) as well as set in stone values as on rat bounties and mission rewards (within known equations). if demand is such that trit is in short supply the market must make it more attractive to mine, however as veldspar is everywhere (unlike more complex and valuable ores) players will always gravitate to where the risk is lowest for a given activity. now that trit on tap (npc shuttles) has been removed the price of trit has had its effective cap removed so the market can encourage miners everywhere to stare at roids. however, as after 6 months you make more isk doing lvl 4 missions than providing trit cheaply to players who don't value your time the price can only rise as its in direct competition for time. it must be noted that the lack of supply of trit will also effect the prices of other raw materials as trit limits thier use in production, a better price for trit will increace its availability and therefore production will increace which will raise demand on other currently over supplied and depressed in price minerals. in the case of moons; an alliance has to build pos's to gain the space means that most moon mining is a by product of this, got a moon may as well mine it, valuable moons are such an asset (high risk) that they require a high degree of defense, they also offer the ability to control the market by denying supplies to drive up the price to empire dwellers who aren't part of the support structure that made and keeps the possession of the moon possible, its again a display of thier power (market pvp) which they collectivly earned.edit, i noticed i forgot to address your first problem: lack of alternative means of manufacture, but making duplicate items from different raw materials must give a different outcome, silk has different qualities to polyester even though it serves the same function, making ties. i gave you an out with existing meta lvl t1 good bpo's be introduced to do it."
"and therefore, ccp should either remove all remaining ceilings and rethink availability in order to restore risk-vs-reward balance or provide alternative means to use whatever's in excess in order to use whatever's in high demand in order for the risk-vs-reward balance to settle itself.it's clear as daylight.and that's precisely the problem. high-reward items should not be available in low-risk areas.so you either make a change to make veldspar a low-reward item, or you move veldspar out of low-risk areas.no, the price cap of trit has not been removed. there's still plenty of places where you can get npc-sold refineables that you can use to get tritanium out of. the problem is they're no longer available in each and every highsec station, but instead at select locations only.what kind of backwards reasoning is that ?the only way for trit to climb in price is if highends drop in price even further first, and they won't increase back much (if at all) even if trit volume traded increases dramatically.the one and only limiting factor is insurance payouts.you have no clue how easy it is to hold, recapture or deny access to it to competitors for a high-value moon when your main interest is that kind of moon, do you ?it's all about where you draw the line.the place where you want to draw it is far, far beyond the level of acceptable gameplay balance.says who, you ? no. they don't have to.it would be \"natural\" to have different outputs, yes.but it would also be \"natural\" to be able to use less of something to make a slightly less durable or worse performing object, but that's not possible in eve either.it's called sacrificing realism for the sake of gameplay.you know, the reason why we don't have newtonian physics, the reasons why ships have a max speed, the reasons why guns insta-hit and there's no line of sight and so on and so forth.that's a half-decent idea, but it kind of needs even more work than this"
"brainshould low sec offer higher rewards for miners? ratters find better rats spawns, pos can be anchored and moons mined. piracy is much easier on gates and in belts. people who live in low sec often pay more for items to avoid travel to hubs through choke points. it seems everyone else should make more isk with higher risk than miners in low sec according. that is what is confusing me on your arguments."
"i'm with you so far......until this point. as soon as actual pilots entered the game, the value of things became determined by the pilots, not the base statistics. this is a \"working economy\" in fact: the value of things determined by the participants in that economy.unfortunately, prices don't follow 'risk'. in eve, just as in the real world, prices reflect tradeoffs, supply, and demand. risks are factored in there, but they are not the driving force. well, on second thought they might be, but risk is a variable that changes with situation. again, this observation supports my assertion that you cannot balance a system of rewards against risks, because the risk is not objective. i wouldn't draw that conclusion. i would instead conclude that the aggregate population chooses to spend its time differently than the original designers expected. is this wrong? can you force all pilots to behave rationally? for instance, i can personally make more isk running missions than mining. my personal cutoff price for trit is around 5.5 isk/unit - *far* below the market (and this is only running l3 missions). in fact, for a mission runner, almost all minerals are vastly underpriced/overvalued. (look at m3/hour of ore mined, minerals refined/hour, and compare against isk/hour from running missions and you'll see that mineral prices could rise a long way before mission runners would mine instead of mission to make isk.)i understand you don't like the balance that currently exists, but there is a balance. there is nothing that says a different balance would be better than the existing one in any meaningful objective way (base prices in my opinion is a false target). also, it is not possible to touch only one aspect of eve without touching everything, so i'd question the position that you can \"fix mining\" in isolation. also, since \"mining income potential\" depends on player preferences, no game-mechanics change that keeps the game a sandbox is likely to \"fix\" this.edit: fixed akita t's name. i hate when people get my name wrong!"

"the thought occurs, that a lot of the current objection to 'nano' ships, is because there's a weapon class that's basically utterly useless.no matter how many heavy missiles you fire at a nano-ishtar, you're _not_ going to do it any damage. but at the same time, 'fixing' nanoships, in such a way as to make the vagabond (and it's fellow minmatar ships) actively worse, i feel would also be a bad thing.something as simple as upping the explosion velocity on precision heavy missiles by 'a bit' - maybe to 2km/sec, maybe 1500m/sec - would serve to raise the bar on 'immune to heavy missiles' such that the really good speed ships (e.g. the vagabond) are still fine in the same situations. but the 'not so good' nano ships have a much harder time of it. (e.g. sacrilege, ishtar)."
"seconded, thirded and forthed"
"not seconded. it was implemented to limit the overloading of the ships to put in the carriers hangars. as there is not a pilot in the ship with the appropriate skills the module don't work and the ship don't get the use of the pilot skills, so it is appropriate that the cargo of the ship is limited to his basic capacity, not the extended capacity. i suppose (never used a carrier) that if you try to put a overloaded ship in the hangar of a carrier it say it can't be moved (if that is not true i think ccp should implement that).unless i am mistaken the change happened when the cargo of ship in a carrier hangar was limited to ammunitions. serenity is pointing exactly at the reason why i feel it should not be changed. allowing to load the ship as if it was player controlled allow the players to expand the carrying capacity of carriers."
"actually it does, jade won the election, the rules say he gets the chair.sorry if i was a bit less then accurate in my quoted post."
"after reading the log and thinking: no.real politics are messy. you asked for transparency, now put on your big-captain pants and deal with what it looks like when two people disagree. you're seeing the world through rose-colored glasses if you think there's any difference between the arguments in the csm and the billions of arguments to occur between elected officials over the course of human history.our elected officials are still talking to each other, and they haven't yet started malevolently grinding votes to a halt out of sheer bitterness towards each other. by that single metric i am inclined to throw my weight behind their continued progress, until such time as they fail to surpass that (low) standard or the next election occurs."
"out the door..."
"not supported.i think it is the vengeance of a small group of people that could not have their way (or their candidate as a chairmember) and now they try to ruin the whole csm thing.edit:i am just noticing i am wholeheartly agreeing with bob members. goons, what have you done too me with your threadnaught?"
"is there a reason why t2 nanofibers are equal to t1 polycarbs? aux thrusters add less speed then t2 overdrives? why, not bring nanofibers and polycarbs in line? that would reduce speed slightly, and make non-speedy ships less speedy? nanoing needs to stay as a valid style of play, but some ships just move to fast tbh.and the agility thing that nyphur wrote about, i didn't know that, but it looks like something someone needs to take a closer look at."
"i expanded on it in an article for massively here. it's definitely something that needs looked into."
"i keep forgetting to link that one instead of the original op ;)"
"i read nyphr's idea and it is intriquing. however, would it not be much simpler to have the benefits of nano mods affected by the mass of the ship? an interceptor having little mass, has the nano mods affected very little and the nano mods are largly unaffected; while a battleship/battlecruiser etc with much greater mass will have its speed modified very little by the nanomods. have the mass of the ship reduced by a fixed amount. if the ship's mass is 100tons have the affected mass be equal to 50tons. if the ship's mass is 100,000tons have the affected mass be equal to 99,950tons. the same ratio should be applied to max speed, agility and accelleration.these numbers have been pulled out of the air but for the sake of illustrating the idea:interceptor 100 tons = speed/agility boost 100% of the module.battleship 1,000,000 tons = speed/agility boost 1% of the module.tl;dr version.a sliding scale for the benefit of the modules:small ship, little mass = fast, large increase to speedbig ship, huge mass = slow, small increase to speed"
"not being able to go fast would take the fun out of the game for many of the players. nano setups are not overpowered and do not make you the next best thing to invulnerable.mission runners playing fw have 2 weeks experience at pvp, they should lose to experienced fleets of 4+ year old pvp characters. nanos, inertia stabs and overdrives have already been nerfed and do not need another one."
"yes, yes. to fix the problems, just train a certain ship. exactly what a 'sandbox' game should do, force you down a certain path. genius."
"unfortunately, this is also true."
"the main imbalance is the amount of mods increasing speed and mods allowing to kill a fast moving ship. the only way to kill a nanoship is to web it, other counters e.g. ecm, neuts will just scare it off.one mod to kill a nano and except for a ganglink claymore no way to boost its effectiveness. there are no rigs or other modules boosting web range or velocity penalty. on the other hand you have nanofibres, overdrives, polycarbs and aux thrusters all increasing speed.my proposal is to release mods and rigs to increase web range. that way if you want to effectly counter a nano you will need to sacrifice dps and tank, just as a nanoship does to get its speed."
"nano ships are expensive because they are inherently good."
"i do not think eve needs less speed. actually more speed, more maneuvering and such would be lovely. yes, i want more dynamic fights. like the battleships in the video's zooooooooming by in formtion.* remove 20km scramblers.* fix precision missiles & other t2 ammo to work against stuff like this."
"support pushing for this to be looked at, though i think its a very very complicated issue.from my point of view the issue is not the speed tank (in fact i like that this variation exists).i think the problem is how fast they move (yes i know, sounds like i am contradicting myself)speed for nanos gives them 2 advantages 1. speed tank makes them difficult to hit.2. speed allowing for very very very fast escapes.to solve the problem i believe nanos have i think a rebalance to make the nano ships a bit more difficult to hit (reduce sig by quite a lot maybe?), while at the same time removing a lot of the speed they have allowing them for very fast escapes, of course they should still be faster than a regular cruiser setups but i don't think they should be matching interceptor speeds.now, i admit this is a complex issue and my idea might not be great, but i certainly think nano fitted cruisers need looking at quite seriously."
"nerf nanos... well, some of them.ships that are built for speed should be left as they are. ships that were never meant to go super-fast should be restricted.an analogy would be ecm. these days, only ships that were designed to use ecm modules can use them effectively. fitted to other ships, the effect is poor.i think it should be the same for speed setups. if a ship was designed for speed, then it should be left alone. if the ship wasn't primarily designed for speed, then it should have more restrictions placed on the maximum speed it can attain.however they decide to address the nano issue, i hope they're careful about it. this one could be a right mess if it isn't thought through properly."
"the whole point of a nano setup is picking your fights, speed tanking does not work nearly as well as everyone tries to say it does.nanos allow a gang of 5 pvpers to have fun in 0.0 because we can escape the 30 man blobs. you remove nanos or make them weaker in any way and you will see 0.0 get very boring very quickly."
"i find it rare that they are used that way, i often see nano groups in large gangs preying on lone targets before they have a chance to run. but it is beside the point. wanting immunity is not a good reason to consider something balanced.i am all for nano ships having a speed advantage, a lot of us just currently feel that the speed nano cruisers can achieve is much faster than should be possible froma cruiser."
"remember... a nerf to nanos is not what is being asked. what is being asked is that a buff to the nano counters (webs neuts) be put in place so that the nano is not an \"i win button\" because that is what it has become.nano's are going for the price they are because the demand is there for them. the demand is there because they are literally.. almost unbeatable except in a very stacked situation. and even then, a skilled nano pilot often will escape.change the agility mod on webs so that the bigger the ship is, the quicker it deaccerlates. that way when a web catches a nano bs... it stops dead in it's tracks."
"dual mwd's were removed because speed tanking was unbalanced.it is *still* unbalanced.faster ships should have reduced agility, factored by sig radius or mass (sig would be better because it would better suit the role bonus of certain ships).speed freaks retain the ability to run away very quicky, but lose the ability to pound ships whilst dodging tracking and outrunning missiles.or, add *another* module to increase the mass, or decrease the agility of a ship - because webs just aren't up to the job when the target can just coast out of web range.whatever the solution, something needs to be done to address the balance.small ships going fast i can live with, but the bigger you are the slower you should be, and certainly much, much, much less agile."
"don't nerf nano, boost all race interceptors so they can't be outrun by nano hacs. problem solved."
"so sick of this coming up. wish ccp would say something ffs."
"i'm fine with the crane having 2 lowslots (it's caldari after all, caldari always have a paucity of lowslots), but it shouldn't have to use one of them for a fitting mod. fitting mods or implants should be required for fits beyond the basic, but not for the standard mods every ship of its class fits.its improved agility modifier helps, but the advantage of more lowslots on the other brs is telling. every other br has better align times and realspace speed than the crane. the crane's only advantage is its slightly larger cargo bay.+4 grid for the crane isn't going to break anything. even +1 would mean it can fit mwd/cloak without issue, if nothing else. if you must, add 4 grid and move its bay down to the same size as the prowler to make room for the larger generator."
"i agree completley i use station containers a lot to organise my stuff in my hangers as they often get clogged with all sorts of junk the unfortunate side effect of that of cours is i lose the ability to track certain assests.. this would certainly make station containers far more functional."
"while the dev who was saying that searching containers would be a significant added load to the database, claimed that it wasnt going to happen due to this, there may be other options which might be doable.for example, searching specific containers (rather than all containers).or opening a container remotly so one can transfere items to and from it.i can definatly apreciate that the search would be even more laggy, were it looking in containers. i try to avoid ever even opening my assets window on 'all assets' on my main, due to the lag. it realy needs a filter by system, or station, or container."

"i was thinking it might be cool for corps or individuals to be able to pick color schemes for the ships that they fly with their corp logo/alliance logo on the ship... might be a good isk sink to charge for custom 2 or 3 tone paint jobs... for each ship you want to paint.just a idea/discuss"

"play chrome hounds on pvp mode on xbox live and you'll see why allowing players to paint thier own ships is a bad idea."

"i sort of support this, id rather see an anti capital ship class, sort of like the spinal mount ion cannon frigates from homeworld. basically a ship with one purpose and thats to pwn capital ships. its cheaper than a battleship but it has to fly with close protection."
"only reason to field dreads is to take down pos'es and other capitals. make either one of those reasons obsolete and what use will dreads have?cheaper, less powerful but more agile equals new form of blob to replace the older one. but this time risking less."
"mmm yes, because stealth bombers make battleships worthless right? you guys do realize that almost all the damage a dread does is because of the ship bonuses and siege mod right? they'd be rather worthless because citadel torps are so slow a bs with an afterburner could probably outrun it, and they'd probably do around the same dps as a battleship (going by them only having ~3 missile slots), have no cargo room for the huge missiles, and be pretty expensive. oh and have fun training torps v for this too."
"burnt pizza's, missed meetings, late for school, late for work, missed jetcan-cycles, we've all tried it.there are already built-in features such as notepad, calculator, and even a browser. a little alarm-clock-timer wouldnt be too hard (at least i dont think it would be) to add, but it would be a very useful gadget."

"well, my take is this:i and a few friends regularly go out and mine entire belts sometimes 3 or 4 in a session without botting. this being said i still have no problem finding ore in high sec in fact even in caldari space i have found mature high sec belts with roids 10-20 km across near the cosmos mission sites. the only possible reason i would want to see belts changed into exploration sites is if there is a possibility of finding better than normal ore in high sec (ex jaspet or hedbergite)"
"i didn't even read the wall of text but topic said belts so you got my support!"
"does this apply to high sec and 0.0? how would you handle npc rats? if you have to scan a system to find a belt, then hope rats are in the belt, you're butchering 0.0 ratting."
"noobs are so cute, sometimes."
"^ ignores.ok then. why should a frigate be able to scram both a destroyer and a dreadnought with exactly the same ease?it's unbalanced."
"ok unpoliteness aside, warp core stabilizers counter one scram point and fit into lowslots. they are a direct counter to warp scramblers, but hamper targeting speed and targeting range. they are designed for \"travel\" fits. you can not counter a heavy interdictor with these as the module they use has infinite scrampoints (hence the nickname infinipoint)an indirect counter are modules that let you align faster, like inertia stabilizers, nanofibers, polycarbon engine housing (rig) and low friction nozzle joints (rig). they may allow you to warp away before the enemy gets a lock. you can counter an infinipoint with these is you warp before the enemy gets a lock.knowing this, you should also read up on the term \"nano\" here on the forums, because this is most likely the next thing that will cross your mind (and pop you if it crosses your path ingame). it is currently a very sensitive issue (politely speaking).edit: to your question above, a dread has nothing to fear from a lone frigate, it has enough drone firepower to deal with it, plus it can cynojump. also, no dread will be without support."
"it has nothing to do with a size issue. it is propulsion mechanics. and you are not supporting your argument well. this belongs in \"ships and fittings\" or \"general discussion\" until you have a better laid out reasoning on why it is unbalanced.and as far as the comment above about dreads not being alone. you would be surprised on how many dreads/carriers are lost to players ratting with them and getting popped. edir and restructure your proposal and then explain why you think it is unbalanced. and make sure you understand the mechanics before you do that, it will help. otherwise this is troll thread."
"it's unbalanced because a frigate should have little power over a much larger ship. it should not only be about propulsion mechanics - it should also be about mass/size. a frig should not be able to carry enough ws units to scram a ship that size. just my opinion - don't have a seizure..."
"well if we use that line of thinking all types of electronic warfare mods on frigate and cruisers would not work on ships that are larger. if i am getting to where you are going with this. so then the only thing able to tackle say a bs is another bs or capital? is that what you are proposing? and i am not having a seizure, you being a little emo i think."
"have you tried tackling a much larger ship in a frigate? its quite doable, but you're usually going to lose that frigate. bigger ships will almost always carry a web or drones that will kill you. thats really the best counter to a warp scrambler. ewar is the only thing that makes a frigate remotely useful so nerfing it makes them useless.as far as low sec goes, you have very little to fear if you're not being stupid or looking for a fight."
"no, what i'm suggesting (in a roundabout way, i guess) is that it should take more than one small tackler to stop a big ship.btw, i don't have a problem with tackling / piracy at all per se - it's all good - it just needs tweaking in my opinion.no, just i think you're being sarcastic and arrogant."
"solauren, i'm sympathetic to where you're coming from but i agree with some of these other folks that the mechanics for preventing pirate attacks in lo-sec already exist.i think it would be interesting to see more specifically getaway mods for pilots that just want to run, and not fight, such as a wcs-like mod powerful enough to overcome warp interdiction, but which takes up enormous grid and cpu and sucks cap prodigiously - the idea being that ships fitting them wouldn't be able to do much else, or sustain it for very long. of course, a cloaking device already fills that combat-avoidance role.fundamentally, though, i think the way to make lo-sec more populated, if that's the goal being discussed here, is to make it more rewarding, not less risky.apologies, no support."
"ok, fairy nuff. just my thoughts. thanks."

"this is serious business..."
"capitals are not t2 battleships.its purpose is to cut down the number of capital pilots out there, ccp have stated many times that they never intended capitals to be nearly as common as they are now. anyone can get one, particularly carriers."
"capital ships are not t2 bs, they are t1 ships. does your t1 cruiser get a bonus for the levels in frigate that you have? no. so neither do capitals get a bonus for the levels in bs you have."
"as long as you are not minmatar."
"it's like it says on crumplecorn's desusigs:jita doesn't lag because the server is insufficient, it lags because people keep joining until it lags.fleets don't lag because the server is insufficient, it lags because people keep joining until it lags.no amount of new hardware baubles is going to stop it... so fleets lag out around 200 people now? when they upgrade it so that it can handle 500 vs 500 easily, fleets will bring 750 vs 750 and lag.when they fix it so jita can handle 10000 people in-system and constantly trading all at once, you'll have 15000 traders trying to do business all at once.welcome to the internet."
"this is a very important issue.despite what all the thread***s say, the only real counter to forum setups is to make threads yourself. this is rapidly leading to the only style of forum warfare being threads.ccp needs to address this asap before these forums become threads online."

"nice! good work csm, can't wait to see the writeups."
"the forums are quiet because we're waiting for news, and keeping up the comments of \"haha, you guys are still trying to argue with jade and convince him of the error of his views\" is like beating a dead horse... no fun anymore.ccp hasn't even posted the first meeting minutes. typical behavior from them, actually, despite all the fanfare when they announced this csm thing. anyway, something will get posted, at some point, and whatever. blah blah blah, let me know when whatever [issues] they decide to fix get fixed."
"ah. did not know about that particular web page. apologies.so, um, what's the proclamations forum for?"
"failed forum experiment."
"its a honey pot for bans that's what."
"just got back home today. the meeting a success, the csm acted professionally overall, ccp were open and gave both well considered answers and together we had good debate/discussion around what's possible/not possible for all the recommendations. minutes etc. will take a while to put together, as we covered over 30 issues as well as lessons on how to improve the csm recommendation process during the 3 days."
"does that mean we will soon see threads in the proclamation forum.i'd love to get an overview of all minutes ect."
"ank and myself will be going over the minutes as soon as we are able to.other than that, i cant do anything but echo serenity's comments. it was an amazingly productive trip. i just gotta catch up on some sleep..."
"good to hear that it was productive.i'm looking forward to the minutes.i hope you all had a great time there.how are the yogurt deserts ? :)"
"are the minutes ready yet??? no...ok, how about now?glad to hear all went well and that ccp was as commited to the csm as they were.looking forward to the minutes/outcome."
"we didnt have those, but the ccp cooks made some amazingly delicious cake :o"
"yeah, solvej is good at that stuff! i just arrived at home 5 minutes ago. i'm extremely excited about the outcome of this csm meeting. i simply can't wait till the minutes are released!ccp listened to us indeed and they were quite open about how we could influence their planning. so overall good stuff."
"just got back myself. all in all it was an excellent weekend, extremely productive, very interesting and i think we've actually done a lot of high quality brainstorming on some pretty key issues. and we managed all this in the full glare of intense press attention and camera crews with a great deal of professionalism and intellectual investment from both ccp and the csm. really was a bold experiment and hats off to the ccp guys who talked the company into taking this risky venture - it absolutely paid off!i can't imagine how it could possible have gone better to be honest. was really great meeting everyone and i considered it an honour and a privilege to be a part of this superb inaugural csm.(details are gonna have to wait till we've slept i think)"

"the supposed advantage of versatility for minmatar ships does have its arguments but the minmatar capitals really need to be looked at, it not as though there are many and varied roles that they can be used for.the minmatar dreadnoughts are, in comparison to the number of sps required to fly them effectively, the worst sp investment in the game. i'm not exactly sure what the additional sps actually are though.the roi on the naglfar is the worst in game. although, imo, after investing all that training time, people should be saying things like \"the naglfar is hard to train up but when you have the skills trained up it does a good 10% more damage.\"so, considering the invested training time and the comparatively current weak result, i fully support this proposal."

"i did have a small thought earlier lookin at the minamatr battleships.if its a good alpha ship we're lookin at then maybe change the maelstroms rof bonus to a 5% damage one? that way none the other ships become overpowered (altho they coudl do with a bit of love) but as a first startin point having 8 x 1400mm iis with 5% per level damage would give a nice alpha compared to what it is at present.its not going to solve all the problems but its an option that could be installed relativly easily am sure since its just one ship becomin slightly more powerful, afterall they are supposed to be best alpha/lousy dps.maybe add a few more damage points to each ammo types damage types. it only needs 1 on each damage type and that would increase damage consiberably the more skilled u are.a small example fusion does 32 exp32 + 25% damage = 40 x11 damage mod (approx 1400s on my phoon) = 440now change that to 33exp33 + 25% damage = 41.25 x11 = 453.75.so yeah just its not a vast difference but you get what i mean, ccp can sort the figures out.but my theory is that the more skilled u are then the more the percentage is factored in and ur rewarded with a bigger damage output, like (i believe) it shud be."

"well we certainly argued for it the database calls thing was that because it was an option we'd all use it more ... and yep, we would! but end of the day its balancing something thats good for everyone against thrashing the database - end of the day we asked for this. they are looking into the implementation. fingers crossed."
"this would be an awesome addition, almost as cool as the \"align-to\" button."
"any updates?"
"supported"
"you do realize that such a ship would come with a corresponding decrease in hp from that of a regular freighter, but because it still retains the dissadvantages of the freighter, it would still be jut as easy to catch.please, let the op give an example of a situation in which such a freighter would be prefered over a normal freighter, or a tanked transport ship, and would not be easily gankable by 4 battleships which would pay their isk loss through the newly obtained cargo."
"i'd rather have an option to change a skill via website tbh."
"as an active duty military member i would enjoy the use of a 1 or 2 skill queue. being on deployment and not being able to access the internet all the time makes me want one so i don't have to leave a relative in charge of my account. (last time i did that i missed 2 months of skill time ) so i definitely would like a response from ccp about this."
"well, you touch on two separate aspects. one is the fact that highsec mission-running is far too profitable for the risks involved (compared to lowsec/0.0 mission-running), the other is that l4 mission-running in highsec is far more profitable than mining in highsec, even with highsec mining being far too profitable compared to the risks involved when compared to lowsec mining, and slightly a bit too profitable compared to 0.0 mining.so, yes, there is a problem when one type of \"solo\" activity (i.e. mission-running, l4s in particular) is far more profitable than anything else you can do for an isk source in a particular area (npc trade routes, mining, belt ratting) and there's even a bigger problem if any particular activity is not noticeably more profitable in lower security ratings.the devs have repeatedly stated that they're trying to get people out in lowsec and 0.0, as most of highsec is way too crowded, with vasts swathes of 0.0 space being practically empty, and a lot of lowsec underpopulated (heck, there's even some highsec regions that are sparsely populated too). as long as the \"network effect\" of having vast numbers of people in a certain crowded area (market and mission hubs) can't be balanced against additional incentives to leave that area (better income elsewhere, preferably in lowsec or 0.0), they won't acheive that \"desire\" of them, of spreading people around.so, yes, a lot of things are \"wrong\", not just mining.as for l3/l4 missions, one possible solution is to make them much more dangerous than they already are, so dangerous in fact that l3s would be about on par with a l4 of today, and l4s would be basically just as hard as l5s are right now, while keeping the same overall reward levels. well, that, or scripting variable delays or variable spawns in missions depending on system security rating in such a way as to have it adversely affect the revenue potential in highsec and boost it in lowsec/0.0. but that's a whole different problem.base prices as absolutes are indeed a false target. base prices as ratios however are a vital target if all the rest of the current ore/mining system is to remain intact (i.e. the rocks remain where they are, the mining is done the same way it is done now, etc).in order to do that you need alternative blueprints that can soak up larger quantities of highends (and less lowends, especially trit) to obtain the same items, driving prices slowly closer to the originally intended ratios.if you don't want to do that, you have to release pressure from the highends, by introducing a lot more lowends (at the expense of some highends) in drone alloys and even some highend ores.or, sure, you can keep make-ups but completely abandon the current ore distribution system and shuffle ores around, for instance swap omber with scordite and jaspet with veldspar. that would \"solve\" things in a weird way, but it would solve them.heck, you could instead revamp the entire mining system completely, and have all ores available in all system securities, just with different \"concentrations\" of ore (i.e. multipliers to cubic meters mined, multipliers ranging from, say x0.1 up to x10, depending on ore type and system security)."
"veldspar is a nice high profit ore to help newbies get on their financial feet.running level 4 missions is a much faster means to earn income for me, and i get to sell high-end ores to the market in empire space to boot.so what this boils down to for me is that there are only 200 moons each for the two most needed t2 materials. well, that seems fine to me too since what else are people going to fight over? it's not like we can have a helen of troy whose face launched a thousand ships. so it comes down to territory, which comes down to productive land.holding productive land means setting up guard posts, forts, etc. the eve equivalent is pos and sovereignty.perhaps someone can fill me in - are all these rare moons in the same place, or are they evenly scattered throughout the eve cluster?"
"theoretically, they should be randomly (and evenly) distributed across the entire space of eve (including places you can't moon-mine them, that is, in 0.4 and above).practically, it appears that a rather large number (unofficial and therefore not very reliable sources quote numbers up to 70% of the total mineable moons) with dysprosium and promethium are relatively clustered and being occupied or at least under harassment by red alliance (and their friends), who use every tool available at their disposal (including but certainly not limited to \"out of reinforced mode\" time-shifting in defence, massive capital fleet hot-drops for both offence and defence, especially quick defence when the timeshift is successfull out of any enemy active timezone and so on and so forth) to hold those moons under their production (or at least deny anybody else their use) with little or no significant chances of anybody claiming them back for any significant periods of time.in other words, it's not so much that the dysprosium/promethium moons are too valuable, it's that the current pos mechanics (setup, reinforced modes, moon mining, etc) is very prone to borderline exploit-worthy usage by a relatively small band of dedicated players.seing how chances are slim to none to see any significant progress on the almost totally broken pos warfare field, the next best thing is to reduce the strategic importance of those moons to more reasonable levels, where it's no longer profitable to hold a large capital fleet active for the sole purpose of defending those moons and nothing else."
"i like the idea of different blueprint requirements to reach the same end. it opens up the sandbox a little more, which is good.the picture i have in my head is that a player gets the stuff together to invent item x. they then should get a choice of what kind of blueprint, in terms of mineral requirements, they would prefer. less of one thing, more of another, maybe they have a deal with another corp to supply them with y mineral, \"classic blueprint,\" whatever. this would allow people to plan for the future (much like now) and take the necessary steps to make money. anyway, this sort of thing would allow the power builders freedom to play with their supply chain while also giving the casual builder some leverage vs. the primary moon holders."
"ok, i agree that running missions is more profitable, but i can't comment on if it is too profitable. in the context of your assumptions i would agree that it is out of balance, but i don't agree with all your assumptions. namely the one about 'risk' being a suitable basis for determining reward, as my belief is 'risk' is too subjective.unfortunately, i think trading the market is the most profitable thing you can do in an area. do mission runners complain about trading being unbalanced? there is only 'financial' risk involved with trading - you don't even have to undock. where's the 'risk' in that? hopefully that will emphasize what i mean by 'risk' being non-objective.i understand that, but i think that's dangerous, and i think ccp does too. \"you can lead a horse to water\" and all that. trying to force players into an area where they don't want to go is tantamount to failure. now, if isk, etc. are tweaked and players move of their own volition, that's one thing. however, the dangers associated with such a shift are contributors to the timeframe. i think ccp are wisely taking time to make a correct decision rather than a \"fast change now\" because of the possible ramifications.i think the things you have mentioned are just a symptom, not a problem in and of themselves. the thing that is really causing the imbalance is that i can generate isk regardless of how many ships, modules, and minerals are in circulation. rewards from missions should adjust based on items in hangars and space, and insurance, etc. should just shuffle money around rather than be a source or sink.why do we need to keep things in their current locations? i thought a goal was to change to different locations - or at least make a more homogeneous population density across space? ratios are also largely irrelevant if those ratios are arbitrary.arbitrary mineral composition of objects would break things pretty terribly. i would prefer to see mineral composition tied more directly into item function personally. i would rather see a movement of ore types (e.g., omber, kernite, pyrox) from high-sec into low-sec before mucking about with item composition.actually, now that i think about it, that would probably cause a horde of people to jump ship, traders to get more isk, and mid-range mineral prices to skyrocket, resulting in wholesale inflation and an overall drop in demand (for minerals on the market - people would likely shift to producing them privately), so the higher prices and \"arbitrary price ratio of minerals\" wouldn't really be a benefit to anyone."
"the most important distinction between mining, mission-running, belt ratting and npc trade routing on one side, and market trading on the other is that the former ones are mainly (you could argue that in most cases they're exclusively) pve activities, whereas the latter is mainly (and lately quite completely) a pvp activity.there's no need to limit potential rewards in any pvp activities that are very fair for pretty much everybody participating (market pvp being one), only in potentially endlessly repeatable pve activities (\"endlessly\" for all practical intents and purposes, not actually infinite - things like mission-running being the best example here)."
"personally i beleive that ccp have located the ore types according to what they currently perceive the risk reward ratio to be from npc entities, sadly low sec is the most dangerous space as its open and practically lawless for players, high sec gets concord, 0.0 gets alliances as player deteriants, low sec gets none.but just maybe with the expansion of faction warfare low sec may provide better ratios in future."
"by your own account then, lowsec ore should earn at least as much as 0.0 ore. then why the hell do you oppose something that will bring back the value of lowsec ore above that of highsec ore ?"
"read again plz... i even underlined it so it sinks in....i say ccp have set reward levels according to npc threats not players, why?, because thats the only threat that ccp have direct control over.pretty bloody simple conceptok now go bandage your foot..."
"double post lol"
"let's see if you can recognize these statements and the logic linking them together:a : \"ccp set reward only based on npc threat\"b : \"sadly lowsec threat from players is much higher than lowsec threat from npcs\"c : \"lowsec player threat is even higher than 0.0 threat from players\"d : \"ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than highsec\"e : \"ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than 0.0\"a implies d.a plus b implies d even stronger.a plus b and then also c makes d a definite must, and even borderline implies e.a,b,c - your statements.you're opposing statement d, which logically follows from a, b and c.get it now ?"
"what is the problem with simply makes higher yeild roids spawn in low sec and 00 than high sec. you have free range still on what to mine ore wise. it simply means that you are virtually guaranteed more minerals in low sec than in high sec mining the almost same asteroid. minerals still fluctuate as intended and people will still mine the ore that gives the most isk / hour in their security belt. it would also help offset the fact that mining for lowends in 0.0 takes longer than ratting up low ends. assuming everyone agrees that mining should actually be the best source of minerals over ratting."
"problem ? none whatsoever. it's one of the many possible solutions."

"rgr that."
"completely agree."
"agreed"
"agree"
"agree!!"
"yep. ship kills against players who are in enemy militias should count for something."
"instead of providing ranks for pvp, other sets of decorations should be developed.why i don't think rank should be tied directly to pvp:killing enemy pilots is not the objective from the point of view of the militia corporations and the factions giving out ranks. you gain standing/rank by completing objectives, either missions and dungeons, both of which are in hostile low sec. the npcs giving you ranks care very little (at the moment) how many enemy ships you destroyed in the past month, they want their objectives completed. keep the current rank mechanic as it encourage pilots to take part in the objective based combat that factional warfare has tried to add.you lose standing with any npc corp you shoot upon, be its members pcs or npcs. if you shoot a lot of swa alt scouts, you will have a low standing with swa. you gain standing with npc corporations by doing missions (and now dungeons) for them. you don't gain standing with the caldari state when you kill guristas rats unless it is in doing a mission.in general, more decorations appear to be on the drawing board and there is an opportunity to have a pvp set.a decoration option for pvp - the ace.for example lets take the classic idea of the ace. each nation has its aces, these individuals may not be the highest ranks, but they are experienced combat pilots and are decorated for their contribution to the war effort. when a pilot is listed as dealing the most damage on a kill he is receives a confirmed kill, if the pilot participated in, but was not the main damage dealer they get .25 confirmed kill. this is only against opposing militia.rookie - 0 combat kills. the pilot has yet to be tested by his peers in combat.bloodied - 1 combat kill. this pilot has had a taste for combat, but not much more than a skirmish.veteran - 3 combat kills. this pilot has seen combat several times or been part of a major battle.ace - 5 combat kills. this pilot has made a name for himself. opposing forces should be wary when he takes to the field.multiple ace - for each successive set of 5 kills a pilot receives a 'device' that is added to his ace decoration.other possible decorations might be theater decorations. if you are take part in the occupying of a number (varies by region) systems in a region you gain your races campaign 'ribbon' for that region. so a federation pilot who captures a single system in the citadel might get a campaign decoration, it may take a republic pilot in the bleak lands 3 systems (due to number of low security systems allowed to be occupied).might even have a decoration for those pilots who lost ships!"
"if this is true then fcs should also be penalized for fleet losses. this ensures that one person is not reaping benefits at the expense of his men since they could simply be \"disposable\" which they really aren't. if they were not penalized for losses, nub fcs would simply leeroy his entire group into a blob and get some kills and points at the expense of others dying in a fire. the entire fleet should get an equal part of the kill, rather than bending points towards a particular fc. either way, i would like a shiny e-peen badge for killing stuff."

"just by fighting against the oposing faction, you lose status to them unles i am mistaken... the theory of this is, why not get some rank out of it?"
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"isn't the point supposed to be that we are all supposed to be capping systems and whoever owns the system we are trying to cap should be coming to pvp with us there? it seems everyone has just joined up to do the kind of pvp you'd do in 0.0 space. it is supposed to be about capturing enemy systems and killing them when they try to capture yours, not camping gates and roaming around.seems to me you should be getting pvp by capturing points. if you go to cap an outpost and then kill an enemy fleet who tries to come and defend it then you capture the outpost and all get standings and ranks. if you defeat an enemy fleet trying to capture one of your outposts then presumably you get vistory points for the defence?if anything i think they should take the npc's and ship restrictions off the outposts so anyone and everyone can go there to attack or defend. or at least do something to encourage people to want to cap systems by doing pvp rather than cap systems or do pvp. xp for kills will only encourage less capturing of systems."
"implement points (doesnt have to be vp and count towards system occupancy, althuogh it could) and thus ranks/standing/medals for points, based on target isk value and size. its not any more exploitable than the current system, indeed less so as if you want serious points, you have to kill your alt in his golem 50 times instead of in his ibis. etc."

"1. while i have similar concerns if the csm can achieve change, from the initial feedback of the meeting with ccp a lot of good came out of it. hopefully this is a positive sign. 2. the csm is a medium through which the players communicate, i.e. players raise the issues, which the csm formalize and present to ccp. as a result, the composition of the csm should not impact the issues being discussed.3. in your opening post, you call everyone on the csm a carebear (except the goons). you then continue to say everyone living in empire is a carebear. when someone clearly points out that the chair of the csm is not a carebear, you ask where you said they were. refer to two facts immediate after 3. 4. that leads the average reader to the conclusion that you are indeed stupid.o7"
"not quite true.i am an empire war guy nowdays. in the past i have been hugely involved in what you might term real 0.0 life.i have done pos take downs, i have thrown up offensive pos's. i have organized cyno chains. i have been part of campaigns to eradicate alliances, i have been in eradicated alliances. i have been in big name corps, i have been a director of not entirely unknown corps.many of my old friends got burnt out on the whole pos side of things. that's why you will see a lot of ex 0.0 movers and shakers back in empire nowdays, empire war is almost as much fun as eve was pre sov, faction warfare gives people the big gang action without the alarm cloak pos fueling / pos take downs..."
"no, i actually never implicated the chair. not 1 time did i ever implicate jade.. i have respect for jade and sf, what i am talking about is the actual carebears crim de le crim."
"i completely understand that d'hofren, i get burned out at pos warfare aswell, what my beef is with the csm delegation is the fact that there are csm's that are discussing this that have had 0 interaction with the problems at hand and thus cannot properly understand the problem at hand and make blindsighted fix's to the mechanic."
"itt, people think csm has any kind of power and that it is absolutely impossible for the people without 0.0 experience to let the 0.0 people do the talking on those issues."
"i dont see the point of the csm. if you trust ccp, play the game. if you dont, quit. there will never be a outside body that knows what ccp does or doesnt do."
"just hire mercs to kill all csm members"
"this post lacks logic. in fact, i think this post is completely wrong on all accounts.suffice to say, i think you should hold judgement till the minutes for the iceland meetings are out. also, you can't group people. i'm most known as a carebear, for instance, but that couldn't be further from the truth.so wait till the minutes are out. i think it could change the general view on how csm operates and have influence. trust me, it's there."
"funny thing is csm was an epic success and those nine players had a hellova of experience in all aspects of the game in my assessment. we discussed a great range of issues and got a lot high quality debate from the ccp team including their leader-developers and senior executive group. minutes are being produced to show the detailed outcomes but lets just say a lot of people are going to be pretty damn surprised at how influential this thing is and how seriously ccp is taking it. csm is here to stay and i predict the winter elections are going to be pretty massive.sure this time round only gs and cva took the thing seriously from the 0.0 alliances, thats not going to happen again i assure you.but luckily for eve and the player base these nine were great. me=roving pvp/combat dynamism/rphardin=0.0 alliance/organization/rpank=empire/economy/missions/war/consequencedarius=0.0 alliance/large scale organization/sovbane=0.0 alliance/sov/posdierdra=empire/new players/warfareserenity=0.0 alliance/sov/economy/financelavista=small scale pvp/economics/investment/financeinanna=industry/agents/ui/rpnow come on really. thats a pretty damn good group. we had a decent cross section of empire/0.0/alliance/corp/missioning focus and pretty much everyone had the knowledge to comment intelligently on all issues. fingers crossed the next csm does as well."

"someone will whine about the lack of piracy being listed. but quite frankly it's also presented, despite popular belief. just a shame no piracy issues were raised."
"lol i was trying not to out people's pirate alts you know"
"i second the hire mercs. goonswarm certainly needs more wardecs where i will never see them beyond the mailbox."
"the only thing that surprises me is that anyone is surprised the csm became a useless titanic failure.like all previous attempts at player representation (star wars galaxies \"senate\") it has become nothing but a collective \"i'm more important than you\" circle jerk in which the only people who thinks the csm means anything at all are the members of it.i refuse to take it seriously at all until i see something meaningful come of it. for example, what is the #1 problem with eve when you ask most people? the answer: lag. nothing else really matters if the servers themselves are unable to keep up with the growth of the game and the size of conflicts. does it freaking matter how pos warfare works, or faction warfare, or unnerfing the raptor, etc if the damn game is unplayable?!so far complete silence from the devs, nothing from the csm except pages of transcripts of petty squabbling about who's e-peen is larger which i got tired of reading after the second page about this important game breaking issue.how about we end this charade of \"democracy\" in eve, hire a professional pr person (sorry, community relations has been atrociously bad since kieron left/was pushed out) and maybe a game developer or two? ccp isn't going to change one damn thing that they want to do based on votes by the csm (assuming they have some time left over after e-peen size debates to tackle anything else) , and to anyone who thinks they will ever do so, i have some beach property in nevada i want to sell you :)the csm is at best a distraction. at worst it's sucking time and resources away from what really needs to be done."
"/pats alexa on the headthere, there."
"see this is where you part company with reality. lag is horrible sure, but you don't solve it by waving a magic wand and inventing miraculous internet connections 20x better than the ones we have coupled with uber servers of doom that are so powerful database efficiency doesn't come into the equation.problem of lag in eve comes down to game mechanics that concentrate too many players all doing the same thing in the same place. solution to lag is spreading those players out by providing distributed objectives that force fleets to break up and do different things at the same time to be effective in the strategic wargame of eve. this are pretty simple concepts and things that the csm and ccp agreed on.as for the rest of your post i'll simply say you are very wrong. and the months ahead will show you just how wrong you truly are."
"arrogance of ~some~ 0.0 dwellers = total fail"
"not supporting csm is the coward way out.let them work and them you can judge, its like hiring a financist and giving him one week to put the company on the tracks.give'em time to work, thats all."
"jade constantwalloftext is a lot of things, but a 0.0 carebear is not one of them. pretty sure he was the biggest ego in the gnw long ago. also, as 0.0 people love to poke at empire topics, simply because they have alts for making isk, or the markets, the empire csm have every right to talk about 0.0 and if you are scared of the topics that will come up, quite *****ing and post some 0.0 issues for them to discuss with ccp."
"eh, i think you people are starting to make the myth into the man. i've seen more interaction from devs than i usually saw from kieron when you consider his job was communicating with us, and wrangler seems just fine to me.oh, and if you have an issue for thecsm that can fix lag, a problem that ccp isn't able to 'fix' with cutting edge technology and programming, without breaking up the server or something dumb like that, then i'd love to hear it."

"bump!nobody against?"

"finally a good ideea ... and look, so few csm votes for it, that's how you know it's a good ideea. :)"

"posting in a thread of a km addict.why do you want to deny the victim's right of using a scorched earth tactic. just screenshot it, and fake a km with just the ship dying, it's an accepted practice."
"so what is the real problem?that they self-destruct to deny loot?that they self-destruct to deny killmail?that they they can escape from their locked down ship without ejecting?it might be interesting (in a completely stupid and impractal way) to completely remove the option for self-destruction. that way when you find a solo mothership pilot you can lock him down and hold him in place until he ejects, and gives the entire ship along with all its modules. otherwise, just issue a killmail on all player deaths. let the suicidal pilot brag about his self-inflicted death on the killboards. if he is fast enough, he might even get credit for doing the most damage to his own ship. ps - not supported because i really don't care."

"there have been a number of times where i'll encounter some random issue on tranquility which i've never been able to reproduce and which is not mentioned on the known issues page. so i head over to singularity to try it out, just to find that i've (once again) neglected my skillset on singularity and that i'm now weeks (sometimes a few months) behind tranquility, and can not even try to reproduce what i was doing on tranquility because i cannot fly that particular ship or use that particular module.sure, i could still file a bug report, but how often do you tell someone that you encountered a problem and you have no idea how to reproduce it? as a software developer myself, i find that very annoying and rather useless.ccp has stated that you should not be able to \"set\" your skills on singularity to whatever you wish, as that would prevent people from testing skill training (a bunch of hogwash if you ask me, but whatever). nonetheless, the idea i'm presenting shouldn't conflict with that: it would not allow people to set your skills to anything you wish. rather, it would simply copy your skills from tranquility to singularity.additionally, when someone doesn't pay for their account, it expires (obviously). when singularity gets mirrored, that account remains expired, even when the player resubscribes after the mirror. to fix this, intervention is required by ccp to allow the singularity account to be able to connect once again. my solution should also resolve this, in my opinion.furthermore, ccp has stated that copying data from tranquility to singularity takes time and effort. i've realized this and have also taken it into considering into my idea. since we're only copying subscription and skillset information, very little effort should be involved, and it should all be automated. there's no moons to reseed, no starbases to remove, no manufacturing/research array jobs to fix.the idea is that you can log into your account on the eve-online website, and click a button that will set a flag on your tranquility account to set it for copying (or perhaps adds your account to a database of accounts, depending on whichever nets faster results).then, during the next tranquility downtime, a script is automatically run. this script looks for all accounts with the this flag set (or all accounts in the specified database), and copies all of those accounts' information to a temporary database. particularly, accounts' subscription details and characters' skillsets are copied to this temporary database; other data (such as assets and corporation information) can be ignored if feasable. once done, the script unsets the flag (or resets the account list database to empty). tranquility's downtime resumes as normal.now, it's singularity's turn for a script during downtime. this script is quite similar to the tranquility one, with an added feature: the ability to convert the data into acceptable data for the current singularity mirror. in particular, this will apply any skillset changes (new skills get set appropriately for testing, etc). the script looks for data in the temporary database, converts it, and then copies it to the singularity database.the whole process would thus take two downtimes to complete -- about 48 hours at the most after activating the process through your account information on the website. this allows for players to be able to catch up to tranquility on singularity so that they may test things there, without the interference from other players that they would receive on tranquility. this also allows players' expired accounts on singularity to be updated with new subscription data from tranquility. and this process is not exploitable: it works one-way; you cannot copy your data from singularity to tranquility.what i'm requesting is for the council to bring this idea to ccp. please support this idea."
"i don't know how well this would work from a technical point of view, but i like it in principle. it's certainly worth having the csm bring this up. /signed."
"sounds good to me."
"had a chat with hardin after he returned from csm meet on iceland, and he pointed out that the issue with limited standingslots was one of database issue/lag.pezzle suggested to raise the number of standingslots in the thread below;"
"seems a good idea. just have work on defining how we decide they are inactive - ie how long since last activity - which rules determine they are inactive etc etc. do corps need an upkeep cost like alliances have now? would not paying that get them scrubbed from the database?"
"can't support this. some of us occasionally go away for a while; sometimes accounts go inactive, sometimes they're maintained to keep up skill training but have minimal use. it'd be disincentive to return knowing your corp may vanish, and that seems footbullet to ccp.besides, who knows if/when someone may crank up an old corp again? losing that history and structure would kinda suck. there's always a chance it comes back online again, for rp or alliance or pewpewpew or any other reason we want. i can't imagine, with the raw computing power ccp has going for it, cleaning out x number of corps is *really* having that much effect on allowable warslots?i'd be open to considering this if we could get something quantitative from ccp regarding this.full disclosure: yeah, i'm thinking of oracle. sue me."
"bad harlequin:i defintly agree with you that there are concerns about corp/alliance history, and as jade pointed out; how to impliment it/judge who are inactive.it all comes down to wether or not the database will greatly benefit from such a purge.this is something only ccp can answer.since they did indicate that corps/alliances had an impact on their database, its something ccp could look into and see if its worth the performance gain vs loss of corp/alliance history.if a corp/alliance is deleted, it could always be reactivated, but ofcourse someone could claim the identity right infront of your nose.as a fellow roleplayer i defintly see the need to hang on to ones past/history and i see your concern."
"just no.i can see why you would do it. but the data resources, from what i understand, is not the issue. inactive corps doesn't add load. it's just standings that is the issue and the way it works.so really, i guess there is just too many concerns with this without benefits. i suppose alliances just have to manage their standings."
"i dont think the reason for this upcoming is not managing of standings, but rather the difficulties you have to face wenn founding a new corp. many names and tickers are already used, looking some corps up you find them to be a one man show. as i am not a friend of such, i support this :)"

"i would like to see issues that are brought up here available on an in-game interface. essentially there is too much rubbish and such on this forum, and i often find my self paging back to find if there are any updates on a particular thread i was interested in. this is certainly not the only solution, but here goes. a person would bring the idea up on this forum.if the idea got enough votes it would be transferred to the live server where actual voting by the players would take place.from an interface on the live server, you could see the issues that made it, give your actual vote towards the issue being passed, see the current status within the csm, see the votes for and against, and it would have a link back to the forum thread. if the thread made it to the csm, they could lock the thread, or place it under another archived part of the forum, and keep this for current topics. the issue that i see is that this is way too messy. its like trying to vote an issue in a korean parliament. lape. lets streamline the issues and make this whole process manageable.pardon if this issue or something similar has come up. i am not aware of any similar solutions. ~ dru"

"i was against the introduction of jumpclones, and i am definately against a reduction in the timer.the problem one of force projection. the very convenience that people crave for casual play is unbalancing when in the hands of more \"hard core\" players.the ability to be in any one of five locations in the blink of an eye, in to a station jam packed full with ships of war bristling with weapons, and out in to combat moments later, is bad enough - but at least currently you can only do it once a day.no sane player would want to increase people's ability to project force in this manner (it would benefit my gameplay greatly, but that does not mean i think it would be good for eve).i am actually interested in if people want jump clones so they can move about easily, or if (as i suspect) they can use them as a way to protect implants when they pvp?if it is the later, then maybe rather than screwing further with the already unbalanced jump clones, maybe it would be more pragmatic (and certainly more honest) to propose a new mechanic to protect implants.personally i don't think that implant protection is a good idea either, but i would take a move in that direction over shortening of the jump clone timer."
"deffo love this idea, everytime i jump clone now i am worrying in case i will miss a fight somewhere because of the long cooldown."

"i am not supporting because the idea of belts on the fly as a solution for macroing sounds great, however, lets not kid ourselves, macroers will just devise a way of scanning them down first, creating bookmarks, and then working off that list. also the solution to overcrowded belts in hi sec is simple. move to low or null sec. plenty of ore there. its almost as if thats what your hulk was designed for.less macro-mining is good, however what happens when eve loses a chunk of its community? i would say that 1 out of every 5 miners i've met in hi-sec were \"unavailable\". no guarantee that they are macroers, but still. could the reason that ccp doesn't stamp out macroing is that macroers still pay 15 a month as well? as cool beer drinking all around fellas that they seem to be, they are still businessmenif this idea is to get macroers out of high sec, then i say this wouldn't help. so i do not give support. get a better idea and i will support. as far as ccp finding new ways to go about optimising their database - they shouldn't need a request from the players, that should be something any good dev team and dba should be researching already.~ dru"
"i like this idea, also hoping it will bring a wider variety of ores found in these new belts"

"the content of your post doesn't seem like you're bringing up an \"issue\" that needs to be \"addressed\". instead, it seems like you're asking a question of the general public, to which you already know the answer... after all, if you could export the xml data on inactive accounts, then you would have done so and wouldn't need to post about how you can't. give ccp their money and get on with your character trading :)"

"have hundreds of additional collision detection needed for each player using missiles? nobesides, line of sight and such doesn't appy to this game, sadly"
"hey you stole that idea from the french navy! where would one keep such ships and how many would you be able to carry? i can carry about 16k missiles, can you carry 16k anti-missile ships?unless of course you are suggesting for a way for frig pilots to sacrifice for a mom or something. the idea sounds bad because all you would have to do is place 500 frigs in front of something and essentially they become amazing armor. blob factor goes waaay up."
"a. 500 frigs? lol @ using them as armour. just give all of them a single primary, ???, profit.b. one missile breaks a hole in the armour, and all the other missile will just get in through that hole.who knows, you have defender missiles which stop missiles, why not defender drones?"

"like the title says.this csm thing started just a few weeks ago and already everyone and his mother is posting threads and ideeas. search function has been a joke ever since i started playing and compared to some here, i'm a yungun.introduce an automated function that at let's say ... 100 aproval votes makes the thread sticky. every week after that double the requirements, 200, 400, 800, 1600 ... most of you know how this progression works. without good visibility an ideea is going nowhere, and without being sticky, the only good visiblity you can give a thread is to start a flamefest."
"well we now know a lot more about which kind of issues fly and which don't and have a much better idea about exactly what ccp would like us to be bringing them in the formal meetings. in the next week or so we'll be publishing some guidance about how the eve population should go about formatting their issue threads in the future to increase their chance of being taken up by a csm rep and successfully getting voted through the csm itself. the more groundwork and research done by the community poster, the better rationalized the arguments and a decent level of understanding what can and what can't be done within the fabric of eve online, will help these things along immensely. sadly we aren't going to get better forum tools in the forseeable future so we are going to have to live with this forum functionality - but hopefully it'll become apparent which issues are getting successfully escalated and we'll post some examples of good issues and bad issues to give people a headup on future submissions. the number of approves is a very rough indicator of how good an issue is (with the exception of joke threads and stuff like that) but i don't think it would be a good idea to have these things being stickied and i think the forum mods would hate us for adding to their workload in any case.we did agree within the csm that each meeting would take up the 2 most popular unaddressed issues each given week as recognition of forum input from the community (alongside csm tabled issues) but if it gets to the point that these are always joke issues we're going to have to rethink."
"the ability to find useful information quickly and easily is paramount in this hustle and bustle world of information and technology. finding information for mmos and specifically eve online as it's the most complicated game in the genre, is also very important. all of the information you desire is located somewhere on this website, but most of it is so difficult to locate you can't find it.looking for that specific post detailing a guide or a spreadsheet to help you out? good luck! searching for information via the search bar at the top right is a recipe for aggravation. hits are outdated, out of order or simply not listed. \"sort by date\" doesn't work as posts still aren't kept in any order while \"sort by relevancy\" only lists threads from last year and never anything recent.the search bar needs a revamp or better parameters to pick up newer posts and information. no longer do you have to search page by page for that post you made last night, now you can find it all quickly and easily."

"in my opinion, there shouldn't be a war dec system based on rp, since the ratio between rp'ers and non-rp'ers is quite skewed to the latter.here's my suggestion:currently, you pay concord as certain amount of money to look the other way, while you wage war against another corporation. the cost is scalar with the number of war deccs and last for a certain time.the current price of is quite low for most corporations, but you should also remember there's smaller corps with 1-5 members who want to wage war too.how about having war deccs scale with the price you pay for them? the amount you bribe concord for, also determines the amount of isk damage you may cause to a corporation, perhaps determined by the base price of the ships you destroy. you'd have a given factor for payment to damage calculation. say you'd pay 100mill isk and you could do damage to that corporation for 500mill isk in total.there's other things to take into account of course, like the number of war decs and if the war should last indefinetaly."

"looking forward to reading the minutes as well as seeing the newspaper articles."
"just got back also.ccp clearly treated the whole process pretty seriously. our meetings were with senior devs from pretty much every department within ccp - many of whom were giving up their own personal time over the weekend to participate in the process.i wont go into too much detail as minutes will explain more but basically on simple issues we basically got yes/no answers and if it was no we got pretty good/straightforward reasons why it was no!on more complex issues it was clear that much of what we were proposing was already being looked at by ccp. on some items we were definitely 'in-tune' and on others ccp explained why 'technically' certain things wont work (or may work - but only if gigantic resources in terms of programmer time are thrown at them - but even there we sometimes came to compromise 'solutions' which ccp are looking into.what was very rewarding for me, and other csm delegates, was when occasionally there was a a 'lightbulb' 'eureka' 'why didn't we think of that?' moment where a csm idea/suggestion either directly or indirectly prompted some sudden insight and improvement idea. it actually made us feel like we did have something useful to bring to the party! it was also interesting to see how the various carebear vs hardcore pvp dynamics play out even within ccp and i particularly loved the reaction of one dev (who shall remain nameless) during the can flipping debate - who loudly exclaimed 'but that's my stuff' in summary it was a great experience and i think both the players and ccp will benefit from it going forward. my main concern is on timescales - while ccp are taking forward a lot of our suggestions these are by no means guaranteed to enter the game short term (or even by the time the next csm has to be elected). but at least we know they are on the agenda and in the 'pipeline' now - and we will of course be using our exalted position as 'internet chieftains' to push things along anyway completely knackered (had to take a half day off work this morning) but also very pleased that i took part and that everyone worked a lot better face to face than they did in a couple of our online meetings. long may that spirit of cooperation last"
"yeah, this is typically the point where an anticlimactic period occurs; you guys are all excited about having done a great job and accomplishing a lot, the rest of us will read the minutes and discuss them and fight over them and maybe come up with even more ideas and [issues], and ccp... will need time to even start implementing some of the stuff y'all discussed, so maybe we'll see it next year or later.coding takes a long time, so interest in the whole csm process will probably disappear long before ccp implements anything, unless you and future csm councils keep track of the current [issues] and their status, and ccp implements some sort of status reports for [issues] beyond the initial yes/no/soon response, to keep them on the front page."

"raising the prices and introducing a seemingly arbitrary timecard while removing options is one of the most ignorant decisions i have seen in a long time.i won't be renewing my subscription if this stays, since i don't especially enjoy grinding isks 5 days a week just so i can get to do it all over again next month. cheers."
"i support this, please dont get rid of 30/90 days!"
"well its not going to be popular with this thread. but since this is a big issue and people are understandably interested to hear the answers to the questions we asked: ***the answer is basically they (ccp) don't like the the various grades of gtc's because it over-complicates the admin and it does nothing good for ccp's profits.ultimately they'd prefer people to be directly subscribing by credit cards (or alternative payment means) and while gtc's are going to be there as a fall back option they feel no obligation to support all the various types we used to have or keep them at the same effective discount they've become true the relative weakness of the us dollar.pressing them on the issue yielded the very honest answer:eve is a premium product with a huge development effort, high class graphics and major design on new features and functions. stuff like walking in stations is a whole new graphic engine thats world class in the industry and fundamentally its our choice as to whether we want to pay for quality or not.so the outcome is basically:60 days cards is what there'll be and we need to understand that ccp would much rather people directly subscribe by credit card / or alternative payment method straight to their accounts - more money gets to ccp development that way, and as gamers we have to decide whether we are happy paying a bit more of a premium product or not. eve was never designed to be a discount mmo and is never going to be priced that way.we did make the point that it would have been better for ccp to be more honest about this message rather than mix it up in slippery marketing spiel and claims that this was an \"industry standard\" pricing structure and that kind of thing.they agreed. in the future we should get less market-speak and more plain-talking.full answer will be covered in the minutes when we get them published but thats pretty much what it'll record. i know its not what a lot of your wanted to hear but i can see their point, and i've got to say from my own experience of the gaming industry i do respect this kind of \"want-the-payment-direct-sentiment\" - it works for a quality outfit like stardock, and does ensure that our subscription and payment goes on a far more direct route to development funding than typically occurs when funds get chased around the table in the marketing and distribution sphere.end of the day, i started paying in gtc's last year too. my reason was simple economy, the relative weakness of the dollar made buying gtc's for dollars a no-brainer for a euro based player simply because it was 33% cheaper. ccp have told us they'd rather we subscribed directly and all payed the same rate. sure we'd gotten used to a discount but ultimately we've all got to decide whether going back to the paying the basic rate is worth it. for me it is, and i can respect the honesty in describing this game as a premium product that costs premium rates. seeing the significant investment still going into eve and getting first hand insight into future and upcoming expansions helps of course - but ultimately, everyone needs to reach their own understanding with personal budgets and just how much you are prepared to pay for your entertainment. for me its pretty easy, i don't buy the cheapest beer in the pub, and i don't expect all beers to cost the same. no reason why all mmorpgs should be a uniform price either and i'm happy to make a payment decision based on what i perceive eve is worth rather than comparing it to other products and lamenting the loss of weak dollar gtc discounts. hope everyone finds this answer informative."
"this issue brings up the problem with the csm. there isn't really any real power there. if ccp refuse to address this issue (as they are) then no one can do anything about it.if so many people want the cards changed back, then ccp should do it, regardless. i expect quite a few subscribers will be lost due to this."
"well the \"power\" was the power to ask a question and get an answer. we can question ccp, we can make suggestions, we can set priorities for fixes to game issues and generally influence the future development of gameplay focus. thats all pretty impressive stuff. but sometimes we're going to get answers that the player base didn't want to hear, and sometimes answers we specifically didn't want to hear and its up to us as discerning adults to just understand we don't always get our own way.i didn't get \"my way\" on the destructible outposts thing. but i got to ask the question and got a very detailed response, respectful discussion and ultimately a potentially excellent compromise solution on the issue. other items on the agenda besides the gtc's got a \"no\" for various reasons, but all of the refusals were respectfully presented and informatively justified by ccp. i think its very important to realize that csm is not a wish fulfillment mechanism, if we're taking issues to ccp we have to explain why they are in the interests of the community and just how they will benefit the game just as ccp need to tell us their reasons and position. on gtc's sure its hard that some people (myself included) will now pay more for our subscription, but i do respect being told straight that the change means more money for ccp and more money for development that will keep eve online as a premium product in the industry. end of the day, they promised we'd get the chance to make proposals, raise issues, ask questions and get substantive and detailed answers from senior staff at ccp. they kept that promise. now the challenge to the community is to best use the csm procedure to benefit the game of eve online for all of us."
"i think a very clear indication of ccp not being swayed by the vocal minority. the plain fact is that the previous gtc structure did not make financial sense for them to keep. and arguing against a company looking after its bottom line because of the insignificant dent it puts on your own pocket is not really effective."
"well, that seals the deal then.-1 account on july 24th. i'll train a long skill in the hopes that my rl financial situation gets better.here is the breakdown:1 battleship every week, t2 fitted: 120-140 million isk1 pilgrim every 2 weeks, t2 fitted: 200 million iskthis equates to needing to farm 1.3 billion isk per month on average, to just pvp on.add in a 90 day gtc (400 million isk), i would need to farm 1.353 billion isk per month.for a 90 day gtc, and funds to pvp with (this is a pvp game, right?), i would need to farm isk for approximately 1 month, for 2 more months of \"play time\".now that 60 days are almost the same cost as 90 days where, i would need to farm for 1 month, pvp for a month, etc.. to afford game + pvp.no thanks, that is too much like work.so.. farewell (on july 24th).very poor decision ccp."
"yes, please bring back the 30day and 90day gtc. lots of good posts here for the reasons why."
"/signedthis is a very poor choice in direction for player retention."

"that is actually ridiculous, and embarrassing. congratulations ccp you have just alienated a huge section of your playerbase with your greedy notions (all the tripe about premium, remember guys this is a active player base of at most 35k people at a time ccp are using a tiny amount of server space compared to majority of other major mmo's)it simply boils down to this 1. ccp wants more money, and are prepared to make eve the most expensive mmo on the market to achieve this, 2. ccp wants to be able to predict its profits well in advance so wants everyone to pay monthly via credit card (in spite of the credit cruch i would just like to add)i want no further part in it and will be terminating my subscription"
"your newsletter, i will subscribeopinion, thread-watchers: is this specific enough (current alpha values are useless vs. current ship stats, boost arty alpha) to warrant its own thread, or should we continue to show support here (help arty in some as yet unspecified way)?edit: i fully support what i glimpse of siddy's idea of ship-shaking, duct-tape unwrapping, rust-flaking shuddering volleys of horrifically-sized shells that rattle your teeth when you fire 'em even thru the pod fluid... but may or may not miss completely, hit the guy next to you, only get fired once every other week or some combination thereof.i *think* snipers can have a role with massive alpha strikes in finishing off wounded targets or suddenly adding an extra whomp to a target who previously thought he was tanking just fine. maybe. discuss?"
"exactly, this sort of damage is what artillery needs. it will make it feared, and actually fulfill its role. artilery shoots huge projectiles really far, and while may not be accurate, makes up for it in shear power.and about the maelstrom bonus change, i think thats a great idea. 3/4 times, people are fitting artillery on the maelstrom, so give it some support towards alpha, and the damage bonus would help that. losing the rof bonus would lower dps, and the damage bonus would boost alpha, keeping the ship balanced."

"it was revealed during the csm that:therefore, i move that ccp focus additional resources into providing the mechanisms to allow individual corporations to sign up for fw whilst also belonging to an alliance."

"i'm happy to support this and i'll undertake to write up the issue submission for the next round of formal talks of course. i personally feel its a pretty clear-cut thing and it would be of benefit to many rp alliances and will help balance out fw and bring more people into those conflicts and enable further exploration of the system capture mechanics and associated gameplay areas. what i'd also like to see from people supporting is how they feel the multiple-corporations from single alliances issue is handled though. the \"fix\" we were told about basically allows any corporation currently in an alliance to join a militia while staying in their own alliance (so its a situation that can lead to some complexities that will need to be addressed in the issue). for example. an alliance with 4 corporations: 1. one corp could join the amarr militia, they'll be able to shoot (and be shot) by the gallente and matari militias - but in empire the other 3 corps wouldn't be able to help them. this could lead to confusions. 2. what if all 4 corps joined different militias - they'd be at war with all the fw militia corps and themselves.3. if all 4 corps joined the same militia it'd be pretty much as if the alliance did join the militia as a whole.so we do need some guidance on the rule to be followed here. if this proposal is supported shall we say?1. if any corps from the alliance join x militia then the rest of the alliance corps can only join x militia too?2. if any corps from the alliance join x militia then all the rest of the alliance corps must join x militia?3. only one corp from the alliance can join x militia?etc etc.see what i mean? we need to not only support the principle but also what specifics we want to see. i'm personally in favor of any number of alliance corps could join any one militia but once any single corp has joined up the rest of the alliance corps can only join the that militia too. hence ensuring that alliances can only effectively \"support\" any one militia."
"i support this wholeheartedly and believe this should be a priority.this seems like the most sensible iteration - once corp x has signed for a militia y, then other corps in the alliance can only sign to militia y. helps stop silliness."

"damnit, do i have to agree with rodj ?"
"oh gods, please, yes. as i've said before, rpers unite into alliances to keep their own specific diversities while working together towards a general goal. it allows us to make up for a shortfall in numbers the might join one specific corporation.taking my own alliance as an example, if you were to merge two of the major corps - gradient and re-awakened technologies - it would be like dropping a box of ferrets high on frentix into a meeting of a stalinist planning committee just after a funeral (apologies to gradient there - please don't hurt meeeeee ). the idea of one corp tolerating, or even hiring, the attitude of the other would be completely unbelievable. in an alliance, with separate corp chat channels, it's much much easier.not all the extant alliances want to be their own faction living in 0.0 - when we created ourselves, we didn't know we had to. some of us have decided to serve a faction, and those of us in that boat would very much like to join the big war our factions are in as full participants not as pirates lurking on the boundaries."
"i think its one of these \"rp pride\" issues that we have to get on board regardless of wanting to shoot amarrian's in their faces (though since its an issue to let us shoot amarrian's in their faces it ain't so hard to understand )"
"i'd say option 2, for preference, or option 1 as a second choice. option 3 is pretty much the same as where we are now in em, with one corp farmed out to the militia and the rest of the alliance waiting hopefully for one of them to wake up."
"yes pls.3. is meh, 2. would probably be difficult to implement under the current system. 1. is of these my favourite.but i vote for 4: once one corporation in an alliance joins fw, i would block the two hostile militias for the other corporations in the alliance. the other corporations then may (but do not have to) to join either the same one as the first or the allied one. and i would totally leave it to the alliances themselves to how to deal with it if they cannot agree on a side.but if that would delay implementation, just remove the block and let them do whatever."
"i won't if you give me some of that frentix and never tell my ceo i took it."

"some thought needs to be given to the declaring war mechanics. either way if you have alliances and militias as war targets, you have two overlapping (possibly 3, if you count individual corps) as war declaration targets."
"getting pvp pilots into an alliance that wants to go low sec is hard enough without fw draining away all the available pilot poolsupported."
"i support this very, very, very strongly. it ****es me off that i can't be fully involved in the new 'sandbox' because i am in an alliance, especially since my alliance has been doing for five years what the matari militia was recently formed to do. what involvement i'm allowed is limited to a small number of inceasingly expensive wardecs, or causes a loss in security status. it's ridiculous that i have to leave my alliance to enjoy this aspect of the game.if individual corps were allowed to join without limit, this would be fine, and alliances could be left to deal with any issues caused by corps joining opposing factions. alternatively, ccp could allow alliances to 'declare support' to a faction (only one, and this support should be reflected in the alliance info), then allow corps in the alliance to join that faction or the allied faction. one possibility is that this could be jury-rigged through standings, possibly by declaring the opposing faction red, or something similar."
"not supporting.that's not to say i don't think it's a good idea (in theory); i'm more concerned about the effect of having multi-hundred-member corporations joining (and you know there will be a few). i think that would be the kiss of death to skirmish-warfare in fw, and the last thing we need is more blob-action in lo-sec.in an ideal world; sure."

"the inability for rp alliances to properly interact in the rp based war we have been waiting so long for is for me the biggest dissapointment in eve. so this sounds like the fix we so badly need to me. perhaps the executor should be able to select which faction their members will be permitted to join, for example the ushra'khan executor selects minmatar and all of our corps get to choose minmatar or stay out of fw."

"the original idea why i posted this in 2005 was to have a mid-size transportation ship that would not eat 1b isk and be still suitable for my transport needs.my needs have changed as has my profession, however... the situation remains the same.i do not need a 1b isk ship to move the 1 freight can with my entire possessions ( yes... i know... risk... yes mom!), because the risk is too high with one of those, to loose not only your belongings, but even 1b in ship's worth.with the proposed smaller freighter, i want it to have the same limitations as the big brother, though with a smaller ship comes also lower mass and better agility, making it still possible to catch that juicy ship, but not as easy as a big freighter.but whatever changes you implement, they will simply not counter suicide ganking of such shipclasses, which is being classed as overpowered in other threads anyway.my personal preference for this ship is the reduced costs and the more suitable cargo space for persons like me, who do not need 900k m<U+FFFD> of cargo space."

"well don't get too carried away (though snoopy dance is always fun!) as *every* thing we discussed with ccp where there were positive vibes is a case of *might* get added into the development queue, *might* get to be in a particular patch, and *might* get pushed up or down the development timescale as their whole process is (quite correctly imho) one of continuous review of how to improve things. their \"development pipeline\" is very fluid ...(but yeah, i'm doing a little dance about things that i hope will arrive \"one day soon<U+FFFD>\" too ;-piz"

"i just read the op and was going to say this; i would say that great minds think alike but i would rather not go there with a goonie.i do think that the only way to settle this system is to set reactions as today its one mineral but if ccp re-balances it will be something else and the same cycle will happen so ccp needs to set it so that a more common mineral 100 (xyz) can be turned into 1 (abc) mineral or something of this nature so that the system balances itself and ccp doesn't have to balance it every 6 months."
"umm not a bad straw man argument there akita , now lets see.yes i said a, b and c, the straw man is your d and e which you misuse my obervations, your points b and c to advance. look what part of \"ccp cannot take into account player actions as they are beyond thier control\" do you not comprehend?. the inherent security status of low sec is reflected by the rats not the players, rats are programmed at a set rate and strenght according to security status, players vary in strenght, numbers and occurance and are too variable. if players were taken into account any system that has players/pirates in would be considered low sec under your straw man. don't bring in concord as its an even later addition (and a reactive mechanic) and was made to reflect risk reward, hence suicide ganks.and statement d is in operation, you get high returns mining in low sec even with depressed mineral prices, i do make more profit in low sec mining in a burst than i do in high sec,."
"higher yield roids still have to compete with easy to obtain (read much easier than mining) loot and drone drops."
"in a hulk i can outmine high ends on ark and bis compared to a friend running drone complexes. in a group i get an even bigger bonus. i can live with that. for whatever reason drone bounty is paid for in mins. i would say they need more low ends to allow for production in deep 0.0 easier instead of the overabundance of high ends though. what bugs the hell out of me is that i can with nearly maxed skills (for solo i only need exhumers v and di v instead of at 4) and cannot get straight trit mined from huge 0.0 veld roids with t2 veld crystals faster than my comparatively crappy cruise missiles skills can get me trit from rat loot. and believe me i have very crappy missile skills. i don't want to trash rat loot drops because for most of the game space (non-deep 0.0) mining is faster than rat loot from cruisers and frigates. beleive me i tell everyone in corp who wants to get me veld when i complain about trit shortages to rat and sell me the loot instead of veld mining. drone mins are specially designed to be the bounty reward in refinables. trash loot from standard mobs giving me more of any mineral than mining focused on that mineral while also giving bounties just miffs me.my .02 isk"
"gee, i don't know... which part of \"a implies d\" don't you understand ? b and c are just reinforcing it.all of the above, it's not something that resembles your opinion, it is your opinion. you do like to use words like that a lot as a last line of defence, don't you, troll ?at best, negligibly so. at worst, not at all. point being, it's nowhere near the ratios it's supposed to be.the point was in introducing much better yield veldspar (and other lowend) rocks, so you'd be able to mine lowends at a relatively decent rate (compared to mining highends or getting them from alloy drops) in 0.0, so it becomes feasable to sell ships cheaper in massive amounts out there, almost so cheap that it makes sense to use insurance fraud on the spot instead of hauling some highends to empire to sell them there - that means more highends get \"absorbed\" locally instead of getting exported - which in turn means whichever highends escape that treatment get a higher value when exported."
"bimbo is epic :-) i love this thread ...i wonder what bimbo would do if akita took the effort to eliminate all his points by dev/gm quotes (i can think about many that i saw myself).i did quite like the alternate shuttle bpo example. that would allow to transform one mineral to other mineral given some waste and cost.btw the largest problem with tritanium is the manipulation cost associated. nerfing compression on trit was a bad move as it increased the cost of manipulation greatly.for example you need around 8 million units of tritanium for a dominix battleship (from memory, i did not check the actual bp). that means around 10 jetcans of veldspar (one yields around 700k trit). that's only the tritanium. you can get the needed midends from about 1/2 the cans of various midend ore and highends are even less effort.i do not loot every mission i complete, but i can build a dominix like every month from loot alone. no need to mine a single roid (i will have even abundance of highends to sell and fund the insurance).the other nice idea in this thread was the mineral usage by system type. f.e. shield components need one mineral, armor components another, laser turret components next one etc. this would be based on the originating region ore. there is to my knowledge and exlusive ore for each highsec empire. of course each component would require also other minerals, but the one selected will make the most part of it in terms of final isk cost. misc items will have a mixed mineral composition without any dominating mineral.coupled with the component manufacturing idea chronotis mentioned a while ago, it would make great benefit to the game.on the t2 components. i think equal rarity ore should be equaly used, i.e. having almost the same price. thus they should be equaly distributed amount different modules so the actualy module usage will determine if the particular material is popular or not."
"your logic sucks. at best, your axioms are woefully insufficient to prove your desired conclusions. a is a statement of how risk:reward ratios were calculated originally - there's no moral content there. b and c are similar statements of fact as regards risks from piracy. d doesn't follow from the three of them together, let alone a on its own. in order to prove d you don't just need to prove that ccp neglected to consider player risk when establishing relative roid values, you need to prove that it was a mistake that should be fixed, and none of those statements even attempts to do so. one can destroy your entire argument simply by accepting point a in its entirety(\"yup, they did. so what?\"). in order for you to derive your d, you'd need a logical chain like this:a: rewards to mining should increase as risk to miners increases (you didn't mention any normative principles in your original construction)b: lowsec is riskier than highsec. (implied, but not stated)c: therefore, rewards to mining in lowsec should be higher than rewards to mining in highsec. (your d)of course, you can replace b with \"mining in non-minmatar highsec is riskier than mining in minmatar highsec\", due to jihadswarm, or \"mining in busy systems is riskier than mining in empty systems\", due to lag and player theft, or a bunch of other statements that you presumably don't want to make despite their validity. and even after all that, all you've proven is that the current system fits within your principles, because hedbergite is still worth more than veldspar. the point you're actually trying to make here, that mineral relative prices have to be adjusted to more closely resemble base prices and their 4:1 ratios, is probably unprovable with formal logic and any set of remotely plausible axioms, but even if it is, after that display of logical prowess, i feel confident that you wouldn't get there even if it was. formal logic is the most powerful intellectual tool there is, but it's got hard limits on its applicability. don't mess around with it unless you understand it and are willing to apply it as rigorously as is needed to do the job."
"akita t my romanian speaking friend:you really do fustrate me, but i'll perservere with you as maybe you'll get the point.yes your d and e are made of straw as they already exist in the game as the distribution of roid types, you are using my observation on what players add (b and c) over and above what ccp are responsible for (a) to advance your position when it does not apply.if low sec had no player threats it would provide a much better return than high sec no matter what you did, mine, rat or navel gaze ffs.again it comes down to \"ccp cannot take into account player actions as they are beyond thier control\" you agree that i can make more mining in low sec, what we disagree on is how greedy we are/should be, you want a substantial reward difference, i don't, i just want it greater, just in proportion to npc risk, which it is. again you quote ratio's, but again i say ratios are using figures dreamt up by dev's like base prices, the moment they were set to paper they were wrong as they depend on the market which is at the mercy of players. the only ratio's set in stone is the mineral useage in bpo's, an average of all bpo's requirements would be the ratio of mineral requirement not reward expectations.you are trying to distort my post to advance your aim, you sadly remind me of an americian administration lackey, bet you could have sold \"iraq is a clear and present danger\" as well as any of the shills that did to the people who lack the ability to think critically.edited to spell romanian properly lolz"
"you can make more mining in low sec solely due to exploration belts which exist outside normal mining parameters and require special non-mining skills and equipment to find. kernite which is the only roid i am aware of which is in .2 or less (i could be wrong here feel free to check me) beats veldspar by less than 10% for total volume. add the fact that you will get full cycles of veld while kernite is bigger so part of an ore is normally wasted and you cut the total volume you mine down by an average of about half a roid per source. it is small but i am trying to be exhaustive here.the difference between 1.0 sec mining veldspar and .2 mining kernite is mostly negligible. editmore research. kernite is .4 and less. hedgbrigite is the .2 and less ore.from eve geek if this copies rightwith a cargo capacity of 900,000 m<U+FFFD> your ship can carry:veldspar 9,000,000 units (27027 batches) 69,837,768.00 iskscordite 6,000,000 units (18018 batches) 68,405,405.76 iskpyroxeres 3,000,000 units (9009 batches) 55,503,559.22 iskplagioclase 2,571,428 units (7722 batches) 67,025,467.26 iskomber 1,500,000 units (3000 batches) 53,657,805.00 iskkernite 750,000 units (1875 batches) 74,960,681.82 iskjaspet 450,000 units (900 batches) 47,447,318.70 iskhemorphite 300,000 units (600 batches) 64,237,996.80 iskhedbergite 300,000 units (600 batches) 81,482,822.40 iskgneiss 180,000 units (450 batches) 172,330,901.46 iskdark ochre 112,500 units (281 batches) 160,023,402.98 iskspodumain 56,250 units (225 batches) 107,118,931.50 iskcrokite 56,250 units (225 batches) 320,551,709.48 iskbistot 56,250 units (281 batches) 363,533,832.98 iskarkonor 56,250 units (281 batches) 415,034,105.76 iskmercoxit 22,500 units (90 batches) 409,735,511.10 iskhedbergite and kernite beat veld. hedbergite by approx 1/7th but is not found in all all regions and only found in .2 space or less. amarr and gallente get hemorphite which is less than veldspar. not saying you can't move but there is clearly a very small difference here. exploration belting and jumping to 0.0 ore gnesis is about 2x veldspar though."

"and that distribution of roid types no longer matches the original reward values, and the reason for that is ccp-introduced changes.no, i am using your own statements to logically show you how according to your own logic, if one would respect any sort of risk-vs-reward balance, you personally should actually be supporting e, or d at worst. ccp can't take player actions into account, but they can take into account the potential actions of players and their \"cost\" in form of consequences. as such, highsec, lowsec and 0.0 are properly delimited, and can be easily differentiated in terms of potential risk levels.npc threat can quite directly be determined by ccp.the fact you can mine traces of hedbergite here and there in some lowsec systems, or the fact you can try and find some 0.0 ore in exploration-only pockets is hardly appropriate/proportional reward.you freaking dense little thing... those base prices and those ore base price ratios, those are the intended ratios for rewards.what's so hard to understand ?no, they were quite decently followed in the early days and even for a couple of years, thanks to plenty of checks and balances in various forms, included but not limited to npc mineral buy orders at 55% of base price and refineables at 180% of base price.and therefore my claim that it's ccp's fault the initial ratios no longer mean much.and the bolded part is where you are (partially) mistaken.d follows from a without needing b nor c.what it does need however is a bit of common-sense, let's call it a2 : \"they did so for a reason, and that reason never dissapeared\". so, from a and a2, d most certainly does follow.one can not destroy the entire argument by accepting point a in its entirety, and your \"rethoric question\" is not so rethoric at all, it has a2 as a clear response."
"hold on....did you read herschel yamamoto's post just above mine? and what do you mean original values, come on the \"real\" value is what ever \"we the players who are the market upon which ore is realised as isk think we want to pay for it\" is worth. the base price ratio on ore reflects the npc set security level, the reward level has always been set by the market which does not reflect npc threat / reward ratios.what did ccp change? umm lets think, they removed npc buy orders for trit at 1 isk and then shuttles thereby making npc trit ceiling of 3.6isk not so available meaning players have to use the other players via the market and allowing trit/veldspar prices to rise, yup, they removed buffers to free the market.no, player risk cannot be counted in the security level equation as its an infinite variable, thats not logic you are using its wishfull thinking, you can potentially die in a 1.0 system, in fact people did all the time in the past so they had to make concord to persuade people not to do it so much, low sec does not have a deterrant, gate guns, come on they are not a deterant but an irritant, but that doesn't change the fact that security level is npc related not player related.so do you want a player driven market place? you know a truely free market or do you want cement mixed with your sand, ccp as you have observed is going free market as its where the pvp opportunities are; so captialist free market or communist price control?. oh! i remember, you hate communist price control, you told me about 15 pages ago.cpp are fully aware that mining rewards are totally dependent on the market (as they always have been), they are fully aware that minerals don't follow thier base price and ratios as the removed npc buy orders so we the players could set them. ccp are also aware of what the changes they have made are doing as they knew what would happen, they aren't stupid they get 300k ppl to pay them every month and grow every month too. so your claim that intial ratios don't mean anything is correct and ccp are fully aware of it because they seem to have caused it as it drives different decisions and outcomes in the game."
"no, that's not yet a ceiling we're getting at, we only got close to it in the panic following shuttle removal.the real problem was when they removed the really cheap tritanium sources in form of coupling arrays reprocessing.and that specific move was an abject failure on their part - removing the first \"stopgap\" without balancing the rest of the structure.they shouldn't have let tritanium get close to the ceiling in the first place.and the only reason tritanium got to the ceiling was because they introduced the drone regions, with an insane abundance of highends (combined with a total lack of other useful drops, not even isk - making the drone regions the main supplier of highends of the entire eve galaxy)... a change that was completely and totally under their control, sending all mineral prices spinning out of control.i want either a truly free market/economy combined structure or some form of price control.having a free market with a \"frozen\" economy is the worst possible combination - there's no real freedom in the market that way, merely the illusion of freedom : you're only free to do whatever's most profitable, competing with other people doing exactly the same thing in exactly the same way, until you can no longer tolerate the low margins and get out. that's not a free market, that's a joke.out of the two options, i would prefer a truly free market, as close to a real life market as possible.the ability to use different materials to get to the almost same results is a small part of that \"closer to reality\" thing.and the market itself is totally dependent on changes ccp makes, with virtually no player influence whatsoever barring reaction speed to the changesfully aware of the facts, maybe. fully aware of the reasons, i seriously doubt it.again, aware of the changes, maybe. aware of the effects prior to the changes, even if repeatedly warned about it by players, i seriously doubt it.oh, the \"they're not dead yet so they can't make mistakes\" argument. i really love that !my claim ? you mean your claim. my claim is that the initial ratios are the intended ratios, and the ratios ccp should move their collective behinds to maintain (witing certain tolerance limits anyway).the game reality says otherwise.the game reality says ccp as a company has no clue (even if there might be some individuals with clarity about the issue, they're not in a position to do anything about it, or not allowed to speak of it yet).no clue ast to why people won't leave highsec in larger numbers, no clue on how to handle mineral issues and so on and so forth.oh, yes, i did go there."
"some questions(because i've never completely understood the standings system), and some ideas.lets say i'm a pirate, and i kill a mission runner who has a perfect 10.0 sec status with a npc corp. do i lose status with that npc corp? i know we have a concord hit, etc, but i've never actually read a detailed breakdown of how security interaction works with npc corps, beyond concord itself. i'm also not a pirate, so i've never tested it either. anyway..hopefully, if you kill someone who's quite beloved, you take a hit, otherwise my idea for this is completely useless. i'm going to go forward assuming this is true.. and if it isn't true.. well.. it should be.1. most people getting ganked are mission runners, miners, people with positive security status with an npc faction of their choice.2. npc corps almost all have central hubs that everyone ends up migrating to because there are simply more agents to give missions in those areas, less worry about long flight times between one agent and the next.3. most characters live within a 7-8 hop sphere.if all these things are true.. why implement a faction just for bounty hunters. just allow npc factions to self regulate. what that means is, just implement bounty hunters into already existing factions. if you've been over by npchauler corp's galactic headquarters ganking people, chances are a lot of the people you killed were doing missions for npchaulercorp, and they were loved by its board of directors. you take appropriate negative status dings from npchaulercorp, and once it hits a certain point.. they decide they've had enough of you, and start shopping around for bounty hunters. add in a seperate tab of the lp store that lists bounties that have been put on players, that anyone with enough lp and a high enough standing with the corp can buy. the higher the bounty, the higher the lp needed to buy it.from an rp perspective i see this as a much better idea than adding an entire new set of corps and factions to eve. it makes pirates pay attention to not just who they are attacking, but more importantly what they are attacking. its no longer warfare on newbs, newb corps, and carebears. its a attacking the status quo, and the status quo normally figures out some way to hit back. heck, you could take this to the point of once a npc corp hates you enough, you're no longer allowed to dock there. have goods there? so sorry, you'll have to contract them to a trusted friend and have them smuggle the things out to you. it puts real penalties on ganking, in a way i simply like better."

"no, it isn't.they're pushing topics where 10 people support them just because csm members like it, even when support was very mixed. just because they like it.that's not representing the players, that's representing themselves.like jade and docking aggression timers (which is a utterly horrible move; with the dps/tank figures as they are, all sub-bs ships are practically guaranteed to die to bait/blob tactics, and bs are fairly likely too if the timer is extended too much)"
"well pretty much the whole csm and every dev in the room ended up agreeing that if you fire a weapon at another player in eve its pretty lame to be able to dock out of combat 45 seconds later. and its doubly lame if you are doing it in a capital ship that cannot possibly have its tank broken in that time span. dock/undock/dock games round stations are hideous gameplay and most pvpers know and appreciate this. if you are worried about being baited then scout and take care about beginning engagements - don't feel that the safety blanket of redock after aggression is something you should automatically have in all circumstances."
"while we are doing sweeping statements:\"living in 0.0 = gankers who only kill people who have nil chance of beating them in combat.\"now, i know that my statement clearly isn't true. sweeping statements never are. same goes the other way ya know - not everyone who lives in empire is a carebear. i actually respect the way in which you want to play the game, i just don't wish to be a part of it."

"this.i don't see the reason for self-destruct in the first place. imho the only way it should be allowed is if you had a radius of death and destruction like a smartbomb that affected friend and foe alike. that's self-destruct. none of this wussy \"oh look i'm magically an egg now buhbye as sail away on my fairy wings\" magic-painless-detonation crap."
"not agreed - i believe voiding the insurance on ships that self destruct would be better."
"issue is not to increase self destruct, but rather to give lossmails to the top damage dealer. simple solution - do what happens if a npc kills a target - which is send a copy of lossmail to top player damage dealeri will support this on the basis that the issue is about lossmails rather than the time limit."
"heh, ive said it before and ill say it again. someone killed themselves for you, saving you time, effort and possibly a few ships in your fleet, and your crying because you didn't get a text file?remember, no insurance, not even the default, for them if they self destruct.not supported, reassess your priorities instead."
"i just wanted to restate again that we are in fact playing internets spaceships so...lol irony"
"sry, nop. you still get insurance. thanks for playing."
"i think i have an interesting solution for this problem.increase the time, that is fine with me. but right now self destruct is like this...tick tock, tick tock, boom!why not instead of having the timer count down have self destruct slowly do damage to the ship. slowly draining shields, then armor, then structure. then boom.this way the attacking force may actually get the kill rather than the self destruct.in addition, why not send a kill(loss) mail anyways. with the self-destructor as the 'final blow', and the rest of the gents who did damage show up on the kill as normal.i think this option would go a long ways to ending self destructs for this reason."
"as most player know, npc ecm is not influenced by sensor strength of the target (there are numerous dev post attesting that). it is the only ew not affected by the characteristics of the target ship.as long as it was affecting mostly player ratting or doing normal missions with relative little interference by players it was a small problem, but now faction warfare missions and complexes see often a mix of pc and npc in the same combat. that make this a game balance issue as a caldari navy npc jamming the right (or wrong, depending on who you are) ship can change the tide of a battle and the target has no possibility to influence or prepare for this (to reiterate sensor strength, included the effect of eccm, dont influence the jamming chance of the npc, the target can be in a noob ship or a bs with eccm and the npc has exactly the same chance of jamming him).all other ew can be countered with the same modules/skills against pc and npc (or cant be countered if it is a target painter, but still the situation is identical against pc and npc).so i think it is time for ccp to change how npc ecm operate and modify the chance of jamming to include the effect of the target sensor strength.note: i don't ask for ecm use removal from the rats or for the player ecm to work on the rats."

"so you would rather have all this 'rubbish and such' in-game? moar crap for them to change and add into the game, inevitably leading to something being inadvertently broken?do i have to type out the words \"not signed\"?"
"huh. you could try reading the solution instead of guessing from the title if you like. the in game interface would essentially be like a ballot box. a clean and simple interface in which to vote on the topics which would act like a ballot box and status monitor of the latest topics, whereas the forums (which contain the rubbish) would be more like where the political mudslinging would take place. the only link to the two, would be a simple out of game link to the forums. i don't think their would be issues with it being broken, as we've had in game corp voting for sometime now. thanks for trying out though."
"although i am not against the idea of an in game voting interface, i do not think such an interface will solve the fundemental flaw of the csm, which is a requirement for \"votes\" from a fixed percentage of the user base, to force the csm to take up issues. this is not a flaw in the ideals of the csm so much as in the implementation. asking all subscribers to keep up with all these issues is simply too much. putting it in front of players, in game, will simply pass the burden along to another medium. it is wishful to think that a casual player will see the votes and take the time to read the forums to become informed about the issue up for a vote. my suspicion is that one of two things will happen - people will ignore it, just as many ignore patch notes that have a real impact on their game play, or people vote almost at random, based on a superficial knowledge of the issue presented."

"give me the ability to join without leaving my corp and alliance!"
"i actually know that there are already a few ;-)if you don't want \"multi-hundred member corporations\" join, do exactly that: \"sorry, your corp is too big to join.\"if you don't want sovereignty-holding alliances (or corps in them) to join, do exactly that: \"sorry, your alliance is holding sovereignty, we don't serve that kind here.\"etc."
"+1my only concern, given that this will generate an influx of larger corps into fw, is whether the losec sandbox (bleak lands etc) is actually big enough to accomodate the additional pilots.20 man gate camps on every gate in the region does not sound fun "
"not supporting this unless an alliance signing up for fw at the same time also sign off on their ability to claim sovereignty."
"personally i think it should require a vote by the whole alliance where they choose what militia will be joined. then the interested corporation with the needed standing would be capable of joining only that corporation.think about it, if it was done as you suggest without a vote the first corporation to join a militia will lock all the others to a single faction. it is not something that should be decided by the fastest corporation or even by the holding corporation."
"yes yes please, fw corps to be allowed to retain their alliance ties"
"this. i don't want to leave my corp to join up to a militia, a militia isn't supposed to be a massively organised corp but a group of individuals comming together for a common cause. dunno that made sense but it did in my head !"
"number 1 has my support."
"supported. it's disappointing that cva and u'k are limited in their participation.to prevent (more) powerblobs forming, maybe only certain alliances could be permitted to sign up their corporations? rather than looking to mechanics to be the be all and end all, the case is brought before a dev (maybe someone in community management) who decides whether to tick the box for alliance x? so the rp alliances would likely be guaranteed participation, but the likes of bob or razor or goonswarm would have to work harder. maybe even this won't be necessary. the more people an alliance has factionally warring, the fewer people they have defending 0.0.the big problem with tying fw participation to not sov holding is cva."
"this isn't about alliances joining fw, it's about corps that are part of alliances joining fw whilst retaining membership of their alliance."
"i don't see how it makes sense for a corp to commit to being part of an alliance then also commit to being part of another alliance/faction. a way for an alliance to commit to support another would be better.if it was to go ahead at corp level then this option would be the better of the choices."
"supported, but i would like to see every corp in an alliance allowed by the mechanics to join whatever faction it likes. the potential fun of shooting alliance mates is simply too great to pass up."
"yes. obv."
"option 1 seems to be the best to me."
"go for it. (especially since part of the outblobbing that was raised as a worry has happened but partially as an effect of various alliances not being able to join in, \"their\" side is getting blobbed...)"
"1.0"
"+1 this cause has my support, but reguarding the above comment, you may as well create a corp outside the alliance in the name of the alliance, as many have donein theory i'd like to see corps being able to join as they like, but in practise entire allian"
"yes."
"had a good discussion on this one. we made the point that its literally impossible to kill capital ships and well tanked battleships within the current 45 sec docking aggression window and this needs to be changed. we discussed the variable dock timer (after pvp aggression) for different hull classes (ie the bigger the hull the bigger the timer) and also a general increase in the timer to reflect the incremental hit point buffs received by all ships over the last few years of patches)ccp recognized that by firing on another player you are committing yourself to pvp and there shouldn't be an easy \"get out of the jail free\" card from dock/undock games.we also raised the issue of remote repping being abusable in station dock range (stargate jump range) warfare and addressed the possibility of having reps vs a ship in aggression timer counting as aggression for the repper. (ie if you rep a ship that cannot dock due to the docking aggression timer the repairing ship will also get the docking aggression timer). additionally we raised as a ui issue - could we get a docking/jump aggression timer visisible as a countdown - similar screen area to the global aggression timer. this got registered a high priority issue for fixing and balance."
"we had a good long discussion on these. i made the case for the changes proposed in this and other threads on the subject and csm/ccp debated the role of blackops and current limitations in the game environment. outcome was that csm advised this as a high priority issue and the prospective solutions on the table are: 1. increased fuel capacity - probably through implementation of a custom fuel bay for jump capable ships that allows balancing on fuel capacity independently of cargo bay size. 2. immunity to cyno jammers for covert cynos. 3. looking at the viability of adding other ships to the covert bridge capable class (including potentially the deep space transport grade tech2 industrials) ccp were less keen on increasing the jump range (felt that landscape of eve regions should still be an issue in deployment - ie those long pirate jumps were supposed to be a problem for blackops)similar on the specific buffs for lessening sensor resolution penalty, grid and fitting improvements. black ops supposed to be valuable for their role, logistics and tactical flexibility - not as straight combat 1v1 ships etc. as i said though, csm presented this as a high priority issue - and i'm very hopeful we'll get action on the fuel bay, cyno jammer immunity, and additional classes of covert bridgeable ships within a reasonable timescale. its flagged as a serious problem and fingers crossed we'll get fuel bays big enough to function and covert cynos in jammed systems soon as possible."
"good to hear they will be looking into it."
"black ops need rebalancing.supporting general idea."
"the most ridiculous ship/class gap in the game. it's friggin crazy!i just want to be able to hual one jet can of ore without spending over 200mill isk on a mammoth..."
"a itty v with rigs and expanders and gsc can empty 2 full jetcans. came in right at 105m last time i bought it. and it insures for under 2m isk. even worse than t2 insurance. i love this idea and am soon to have a new favorite csm i think. lol"
"i know people keep telling me, \"don't haul stuff in a ship that costs less than the goods\" but 100m uninsured value hauling around 6m isk worth of veldspar seems a little dumb :)wholeheartedly support this idea, even though its already been favourably received by ccp! i especially want something for mining ops, so i can visit a belt, tractor the fleets' jetcans (which means a few high slots, no turrets), then run back to base. low slots for nanofibers would be nice, to allow more agility so the round trip from station to belt to station doesn't suffer a bottleneck of 2 minutes to do a 180<U+FFFD> turn."
"supported. it's definitely a gap in progression."
"yes. i support this. not for long term but for those short skills. even if it were just que 1 skill up. or make amount you can que unlimited for 24 or 48 hour period. if you had several 2 or 4 hour skills to do.let's at least hear why ccp remains with this log in every 2 hours just to switch skills bull****. it does nothing to help the game really."
"i support simply getting a response. i think a que of somesort (set number of skills) would be supported by military people facing year long deployments or month+ long schooling."
"i'm tired of switching skills at odd hours of the night. make this game more accessible to people who aren't jobless, zit-faced, delivery pizza eating, nerdcore players."
"a skill que isn't needed for when i don't have time to log in and play (that's my choice), it's needed for when tranquility crashes unexpectedly and i can't log in and change skills. even a 12 hour, 1 skill que would be a great improvement. at very least an official response would finally put this issue to bed."
"yea"
"supported...unfortunately, ccp won't employee a skill queue feature, as this would encourage people to leave large periods of time between log ins and eventually get bored of the game / forget about the game / get out of the routine of playing the game etc. this would result in people starting to realise that they're paying for something they're hardly using, and ultimately ccp's subscription income would go down."
"you are assuming they implement an unlimited queue, ccp isn't that stupid."
"this debate is still raging?here's my final observation for this thread: when two observations disagree, at most one can be correct; usually neither of them are."
"why you still care about 2002 prices? didn't you start this thread by claiming to like the free market? if so, why are you so eager to return to the days of command-economy ceilings and floors on mineral prices? that requires no balance, no finesse, and no respect for player time, skill investment, or choice of career. you're just changing the laws of economics to suit your preconceptions. i admit, it does work in a fictional universe, but it's still as stupid as it would be in reality. let's review. here are your original a-e:a : \"ccp set reward only based on npc threat\"b : \"sadly lowsec threat from players is much higher than lowsec threat from npcs\"c : \"lowsec player threat is even higher than 0.0 threat from players\"d : \"ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than highsec\"e : \"ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than 0.0\"with the argument you're using being that a->d, and a+b+c->e. and, as stated before, your argument fails miserably. a-c are descriptive statements, d-e are normative claims. you cannot prove a normative conclusion without a normative premise. i grant the truthfulness of a, but all it implies is that mining rewards were originally set up to be roughly linear to mining risks from npcs. it doesn't imply that there's a problem, let alone that your solution is correct. b and c are irrelevant to a, to the point where i don't think any sane argument can use them together. a says that rewards are based on npc risk, b and c talk about levels of pc risk. if npc risk is the basis of the reward structure, pc risk is pointless to discuss. and what i meant by \"accepting a in its entirety\" is that if you say rewards were originally based on npc risk, and i agree, you've gotten precisely nowhere towards proving d. yes, rewards were established based on npc risk. rewards still increase roughly in line with npc risk - there are a couple blips, but on the whole it's not bad, even after years of price changes. so given that rewards were established to line up with npc risk, i can acknowledge that by pointing to 2003 prices, and i can even accept a2 by pointing to the fact that it's still fairly good now. actually, by doing so, i'm accepting a related point - that prices should line up with npc risk, which you never claim - but i figure i'll cut you a bit of slack. the funny thing about all this is that i agree with your fundamental point - lowsec does need boosting something fierce. but the problem is that you chose to make that point in such an offensively stupid way that i couldn't let your squalid excuse for \"logic\" stand uncontested. you use descriptive statements to make normative arguments, your method is rife with non sequiturs, and you speak of my \"rethoric(sic) question\" when i didn't ask any questions, let alone rhetorical ones. your methodology is a miserable failure, and i figured it was as good a time as any to attack it."
"i ran out of characters on the last post, but i couldn't let this little gem go:this word \"free market\"...i do not think it means what you think it means. your complaint seems to be that the laws of physics and engineering are consistent. that's like complaining that everybody at a pga event is shooting for the same hole from the same tee - \"oh no, it's been reduced to a contest of player skill! inconceivable!\". furthermore, your proposal, from what i can tell, wouldn't even fix this so-called problem - you'd just create more different ways of getting the same low* margins. when your solution doesn't fix your problem, you need a new solution. * - industrial margins are hardly \"low\" right now. you just have to know what to build. i don't have any points in pe, and i still routinely see goods i could produce at a profit. i don't bother(since i don't keep stocks of blueprints or minerals around, and i can only run one line), but any halfway competent industrial character is earning 20%."
"god, i hate these forums, i was just writing a 2000 char responce when it suddently reset everything for no apparent reasonsummary of what i wanted to say:2 possible solutions:1. very high-yield low-end asteroids in lowsec/0.02. increased yield/m3 for veldspar (best done by decreasing veldspar volume)result: highsec completely mines out veldspar (increased supply) -> reduced veld cost -> increased cost for everything else"
"the removal of npc goods like coupling arrays for reprocessing to circumvent player based supply had to go just like shuttles which mirrored them on a smaller scale, can't you see that ccp are trying to make easy ways to gain trit dissapear from the game over time to promote player activity. ccp are trying to use players instead of code to set supply and value as they already set demand, they are going towards the true free market ecomony where pvp is the name of the game. eve is non consentual pvp after all, its made by griefers for griefers, so its stands to reason that market griefing has to be built in as its part of the eve vision. truely free markets always get dominated by only a few parties (why do you think adam smith said they were bad, he did you know), mom and pop farming dissapears (and i know all about that) as monopolies take over, but there will always be niche markets (like organic) where small operators can profit from. however in eve the structure of alliance > corporation > sole trader all can benifit as the demand can never be satisfied for trit, with higher trit prices more noobs will mine, corporations will start to fight over veld fields, but for that to happen the price has got to rise.high trit price is a pvp opportunity for all, in the roid belts corps fight over who gets the roids, pirates get more targets, and miners get more reward but with increaced potential for grief. to maximise profits high sec mining corps will have to look to skilling up for a rorqual and moving to low sec due solely to war dec's over competition for veldspar roids. also with the introduction of fw which does seem to make low sec a bit safer from player agression, ccp are trying social engineering instead of set buffers to change players behaviour as they know the greatest profit for the least perceived risk is where players will gravitate too. thats where i'm coming from, its ccp vision, griefing for the sake of griefing, the powerfull abusing thier power until another powerbloc stomps on them. it also offers countless opportunities for ccp for game devolopment to keep all those 5 year old players interested and attract new players, if you look its always corrective leaps via new content not nit pick every month or so if someone preceives an imbalance.take the very long view from an objective stand point, you know roughly the eve storyline progression and its base paramiters that they sort of work to, you know that every 6 months or so change will happen,so don't get so worked up over a molehill which is what it is at the moment. the current situtation is liveable under for the well foreseable future, no low sec and 0.0 miners are migrating to high sec to mine veld for trit, people may meta game it, but even though meta gaming is lame and takes out the fun/uncertianty of life in eve (which is where the spice is), its not the same effect as the main moving out of alliance space."
"first off, for industrial characters, it's not so much just margin anymore but rather margin times volume. sure, you could be making shuttles and selling them at 30k each for a whooping 200++% margin, but at barely over 200 shuttles a day production limit using all possible lines, that's a measly 4-5 mil a day actual profit, at best, which kind of sucks imo. so, unless you list potential top profit per day alongside those margins, your claims are at best irrelevant. can you maintain a 20% margin for 1 bil daily investments ? what about 500 mil daily investments ? it's all about profit per day from a certain level upward, not about profit percentage.second, my argument was never about margins for industrialists. that \"margins\" remark was just that, a remark on how things work. heck, one of my mainstay arguments pretty much anywhere in production-related threads (be it t1, invention+t2 manufacture or whatnot) is that margins will always be relatively low for manufacturers unless you introduce a true economy of scale (i.e. manufacturing hundreds/thousands of any units/batches will result in a per-unit cost far below the cost of manufacturing a single unit/batch). i'm not even sure where the heck you want to go with it. as this was never the \"presented problem\", of course none of the solutions presented here do anything for it, since they're solutions for something else entirely.third, my complaint is that the laws of physics and engineering are complete and consistent in the real world, yet in eve they're all but a pathetic simulacrum. there's no such things as research and developement in eve : a player can not create an item that doesn't already exist, and the selection is very limited ; you can not research ways to use cheaper materials to get a similar product ; you can not improve the performance of a product by using better materials... and so on and so forth.for this reason, the claim that the market is player-driven, or the claim that the market is \"free\" has next to no value - of course it's \"player driven\"... driven by how many people do the math as opposed to how many fail to do so, and how fast they adapt - of course it's \"free\"... free to not participate when profits are too low for comfort, or free to participate where margins look good. all in all, everything in the eve economy/market is predictible given the full data on changes. when you can always very accurately predict something, that hardly qualifies as \"free\" anymore, does it ?"
"don't make me laugh. other than the goon's jihadswarm (which focused on ice miners mostly), a killing spree that only really lasted a short while (if they're still at it, the kills are negligible in volume), there's really not much in the way of \"griefing\" over veldspar mining.there's still plenty of veldspar in belts of systems within 5 jumps of jita, and the price of tritanium buy orders there is pretty damned high... if even there there's really not much of a competition going on......ungh, why do i even bother."
"you understand what your saying and what it implies? lots of veldspar roids in what you consider to be no risk space still doesn't supply sufficient reward to give enough profit : time ratio to promote it as a eve player activity. basically miners don't mine solely for trit (veldspar) because they can mine better profits else where......edit:..... or do other more profitable things, ffs having to put something so bloody obivious in is pandering to utter stupidity, but i'll do to stop more cretins. /edityes you get it finally, veldspar/trit is undervalued, not the other way round at the moment."
"do you even play this game or are you just intentionally spouting nonsense ?the only reason nobody mines for veldspar is that everybody's running l4 missions, not because everybody is mining something else or somewhere else.mining veldspar, you get around the equivalent of 5 mil isk/hour solo in a covetor, or up to 10 mil isk/hour in a larger gang with a mindlinked commander while flying a hulk and splitting profits with haulers.speed-running l3 missions in a drake you get more than 5 mil isk/hour pure cash from bounties and rewards alone, up to 10 mil isk/hour if you consider everything else too (lps at a decent exchange ratio, the occasional implant storyline, etc).speed-running l4s in a cnr however will offer at least 20 mil sik/hour in bounties/lp combined, more per account and with less risk if you're dual-boxing (50 mil/hour on two accounts combined is not abnormal).so, if you need something or somebody to blame, blame the fact mining is too lame to be an attractive alternative (unless it's very profitable) and mission-running too freaking profitable (even if a tad bit boring after a while)."
"bimbo... your position is flawed. the problems are real, the devs are aware of them, and are working towards solutions to fix it."
"and where on god's green earth can highsec miners find something more valuable than veldspar?people aren't mining veld because there's something better to do (missions, trading, pvp, whatever), not because trit is undervalued, it's like comparing apples to oranges.also, what kazzac elentria said"
"i posted a lot of numbers to back myself up to prove that veldspar is better than most anything else until you get to true 0.0 ore. i look to have been ignore to continue the bickering though."
"because we still have the same 2002 blueprints that were created and calculated based on those base prices and price ratios !!!can't you comperehend such a simple fact ?prices, price ratios and risk/reward system changed but the blueprints are still the same as they were in the begining.get that into your think skull.and special one for bimbo: we have a free market in the sence that you are free to starve to death. you are not free to change anything but the price. you cannot invent more effective methods or alternative sources to take advantage of material shortages and manufacturing limits.so we have a free market but a fixed economy based on fixed laws that were set in stone in the begining and did not change since."
"moons, pos and sov need fixing, nto sure this is the way but discuss it"
"supported"
"lol, you peeps really fall into a trap, can't you understand what i said, sorry for not adding pictures... or mentioning the bloody obivious (every competing action that has a greater profit potential) as you are too slow to grasp the big picture.if mining for trit is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract miners.all your really pointing out is that lvl 3 and 4 missions belong in a higher risk area like low sec as they pay too highly especially when loot and salvage is taken into account to be within the risk reward for high sec. as high sec only has frigate rats in belts it should be a given that the highest mission rat should be cruisers with the very odd bs, after all higher reward deserves higher risk. kazzac, i looked at jades posts @"
"then you weren't paying attention. csm meetings covered the 0.0 dilemma, the fact that there is no drive to move to 0.0 space despite that being game design. they also discussed the broken sov mechanics, how they affect the t2 component market with regards to prices, etc...it all got covered... you just fail at reading comprehension.either that or epic troll is epic*and thinking about it, i just agreed with jade in regards to some positions... i feel dirty now"
"/signedthough i don't nessessarily agree with every akita says, this one is spot on.the biggest reason that eve is not a free market is due to the restrictions that ccp has put into the manufacturing process. lets say you were making a car. in real life (yes, i know its a game) if the prices of steel went through the roof, you can make your body panels out of aluminum. then electrical prices soar, driving up price of that so you switch to polymars. crap, the epa just altered its rules on \"dangerous chemicals\", so you now are building your body panels in brazil where the restrictions are lower.in eve you have none of those options. if the price of moon-materials required for t2 ships are out of wack because of lack of supply (or market control of rare moons), you should be \"inventing\" alternative methods of building the ship with different materials. as it is you are bound to an over-priced supply of arbitrary stuff with no method of getting around it.give us alternatives because what we have now is mostly a shift in market control from the bpo owners to who controls the moons. hardly a \"free\" market, if anything the prices are even more tightly dictated now."
"you need to check the \"check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on\" checkbox too i'm seriously leaning on the epic troll is already epic option myself.but hey, free bumps !"
"but we are not currently discussing moon materials or t2 but risk/reward/profit ratio and how it applies to mining and trit, so only half of akita t's op and not the half were discussing in these few posts.umm makes me wonder"
"this is a game and it's suppossed to be fun. however a free market without the options i mentioned will always spiral into a deadlock situation where those with the resources have everything and the rest can live on scrubs. that won't make for a fun game. also there will be no challenge for anybody to attempt without a ridiculous high barrier to entry (as was the t2 lottery).you are arguing principles regardless of their application and results of that application and we are arguing game balance to make a game fun. thus we have no meeting point in the different views.no use arguing with you (and akita tried realy hard)."
"there, right there you shot yourself in the foot with a giant bazooka\"if mining for x is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract miners\"that is exactly what akita has been ****** saying for god knows how many postsreplace x with mexallon, isogen, nocx and your argument that \"trit does not need to go down in price\" is flawedjust look at procurement specialist's pricesevery low-end ore is less valuable than tritanium. thus, by your statement above, it would mean that miners should be attracted to mining mexallon, isogen, nocx, by increasing their price. this will never, ever happen without ccp intervention.rarity should be directly proportional to value, yet for tritanium, it is not.if mining for mexallon is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract miners.if mining for isogen is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract miners.if mining for nocxium is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract miners.get it?"
"you are an idiot. you always only pick a very specific part of the whole and never try to reason from the perspective of the whole game universe. you never seem to connect the dots (or are unable to)."
"well like said before, your certainly lived up to the brainless part....free bumps indeed"
"fix'dbut other than that, yup, couldn't have said it better myself."
"umm, currently the price of trit is high as demand out strips supply, other minerals are depressed as supply out strips demand due to the limited supply of trit.akita t has been saying nothing of the sort, she's saying trit prices are too high, the ratios between the minerals are broken and she wants them reinstated. look at the opyou are calling me out on me agreeing with myself, wtf!oh trit is under supplied i.e, rare in porportion to its demand as its a huge volume that is required. i argue all the time that trit prices are too low for this very reason."
"i thought internet spaceships were \"serious business\" not fun. whats fun, its a subjective when you look at it, so some have fun ratting, others mining, others sitting in jita doing the 0.01 isk manipulations, you just want cake because you don't have what the big alliances have as they aren't in here moaning about the price of trit are they?."
"no no no, i agree with the position that veldspar gives a great reward not in proportion to risk in high sec, but my point is under current market conditions to meet the demand for trit its price will have to rise regardless of risk reward as its under supplied because its such a high volume demanded.i have seen buy orders for 3.7 isk for trit, the average is 3 isk, there is enough isk around to allow a for trit price rise, were all just greedy and don't want to pay."
"bimbo's statement was that trit demand far outstrips supply thus with trit being the shortage mineral the price of trit must rise to attract miners to come mine it for the production train to get going again.no other mineral is used in such vast quantities (please everyone agree with that statement) and tritanium is currently the largest deadlock mineral so prices are having to elevate above originally intended to make it attractive to mine.my issue is that the only way to fix this problem (for those who agree it is a problem as the most abundant mineral in the universe should not normally be the train stopper) is to reduce the quantities required of tritanium, adjust bpos, or increase the supply somehow. this is like having a deadlock on universal hydrogen. it is everywhere.now i dislike this but my specific concern is that mining for a mineral should always be the best source of that mineral. this is why in 0.0 where i mostly live i want better yielding veld so that i can mine trit at a better rate than i can rat it. it makes rp sense and on the reverse side giving empire poorly yielding arkonor and other 0.0 roids allows the economy more freedom. and i didn't want to give a buff to just 0.0. i have mining friends that stick to empire too."
"not really an issue in 0.0. trit prices are lowered because it is so friggin painful to haul it to jita for selling. high ends match jita much more closely do to logistics. i still buy trit at 2 and pyerite for under 1 on buy orders all teh time.my main is telxkiskisrowr in goonswarm but procurement comes up first alphabetically."
"qft"
"well as moon materials and roid minerals are derived by different mechanics they should be split up. this whole thread has been plauged by picking on parts of peoples posts, so if you want me to discuss the whole moon and roid thing in one topic it won't happen as both are driven/controlled by different mechanics, even though they both effect t2 production and alliance captial production (who shouldn't have issues with prices of raw materials).moon mins are totally under alliance control, roids are not, but what akita t wants to do doesn't fix the issue in a decent way, its not elegant and good code is always elegant."
"of course he said that, relative trit demand is too high because relative highend supply is too highhe said that trit price is too high, and that the market supply/demand works fine, therefore it logically follows that:1. trit demand is too high;2. ratio between minerals is broken;i'm really tempted to report you for stupidity/inability to read, sadly that's not a valid reason to get you gagged"
"how can trit demand be too high, its a reaction to what people want to build ffs, low cost high ends have stimulated production which has led to the shortage.1. trit demand is too high also means too many people want to build stuff doesn't it!2. ratio between mineral values are not reflected in the market place as they are linked to supply of individual minerals to thier demand requirements. in game the roid ratio is fine, its just that high sec has too many high reward activities and mining veld doesn't cut it anymore, why mine when you can put on your posing pouch and run lvl 4 missions which really belong in low sec if the risk/reward is taken into account. ratios of requirement is set (bpo's) but prices/real values aren't as they are realised in a player run free market ecomony with a free price system."

"akita t did point out that the drone drops do not balance and she is correct, the drops are too valuable for the risk (reward is set too high) and does lead to a localised trit shortage as mining/reprocessing for trit is not cost effective. also it does have the potential capacity to flood the market (which is what akita t suggests but i'm not really sold on as its only 8 of regions out of 63), its a fix that is better than adding alternative bpo's as its quick and easy, and doesn't add pointless stuff and removes a localised anomoly."
"victory! at last ! recognition !the fact that zydrine and megacyte prices crashed heavily while tritanium experienced a heavy supply shortage almost immediately after the tntroduction of the drone regions (there's a lot more than just one - there's eight of them, all of them generating almost exclusively highends out of every belt kill, value-wise - that's basically one drone region for every other four 0.0 regions) should have been a dead giveaway.in base values, you get something akin to 3 to 6 mil isk worth of minerals per \"drone battleship\" kill iirc, which can easily happen every 5 minutes or so, if not even more often. allowing those drops to be almost perfectly balanced mineral-ratio-wise would be akin to letting the drone regions be almost fully self-sufficient (you'd only need pos npc-sold consumables, and that's about it), so you probably want to only partially balance them (say, leave 1/3 as is, and change 1/3 of highends value in mixed lowends values, that way you end up with only 1/3 of the previous value as export potential).so, in the end, you finally arrive to (almost?) completely agree with one of the several solutions i presented in the op.and it only took you, what, 8 pages ?"
"why not? every other 0.0 region can be t1 sufficient until you start trying to produce cap swarms. cap swarm prodruction simply takes more than 1 region of resources so no region can be sufficient by itself for that."
"what i say your name and your happy, lol, you do understand that i really only disagree with you on the perception of severity and the choices you give for rectifing it, i prefer the market to fix it as far as it can as thats better for the game in the very long term. i am totally opposed to the different mineral requirement duplicate good bpo's as it doesn't really add anything into the game apart from pointless complexity for its own sake. i think i may have suggested (if i haven't i should have) the addition of bpc meta lvl t1 good drops from rats with different mineral requirements as it stays within the story of eve and is of limited overall effect as it is producing existing goods that can't be manufactured at present and have a ready market. those goods could be anything that drops now, but it also leaves it open to ccp to give pirate faction ships as a logicial extention, an addition that a great number of people would like to see. i also agreed with on page 1 here: both of these add to the existing game by broadning it, opening up avenues not yet explored that already exist, a tweak not a revamp which will be tech 3 in a year plus.i'm all for a free market ecomony with free price systems that totally rely on player demand and supply. no npc station shop sources of minerals via reprocessing and insurance being tweaked to provide only a portion of the daily eden mean value of raw material cost of the ship when it was destroyed., that way player loss is mitigated to a degree and discourages ganking in high sec unless its really profitable. mining reward will always be driven by the market (and the market by logistics to a lesser extent) and roid composition will continue to reflect security status (npc threat), its known that ccp have been comtemplating changing the roid allocation across eve, that will be the time to tweak mineral make up and refinable quantities of the ores to lessen the trit bottleneck in production as the player base and thereby demand grows. risk reward is broken but i feel that its the lvl 3 and 4 missions that break it, they offer too high a risk and reward in comparison to the risk of the space they occur in, they should be located in the security status of the average rat's level they employ, so nothing larger than a rat cruiser could appear in high sec space. mission runners get low sec rewards fighting low sec npc's in high sec, and thats a bigger problem as it stops migration to low sec, however fw has open up the opportunity to move them, expand fw at the same time and let them have relative safety as missions are more a home guard role instead of a skirmish role like fw."
"yes l4 missions in .8 space are a bit absurd. wth is concord doing to let multiple criminal bs in? players can't get in. ways to alter productionthe actual ways to alter production belong in a separate thread. use that one or start a new one but the idea that something can be changed to fix it isn't bad. i still say that adding low ends to drone mis to produce more sustainable drone regions and introducing higher yield low end roids in low sec and null sec would allow the market to fix everything else itself. the drones and rat loot artifically devalue mining but i would not want another you get more ore fix. the suggestions like the 1/10th ore size where nothing can help mining don't really fix that disparity of trit needed vs minable amounts compared to zydrine/megacyte needed vs mining amounts. sorry i think i rambled. long day and getting tired."
"that's not how you seem to be expressing yourself, not by a long shot. the market can't fix it, ever, all by itself, without ccp intervention.if the current ores remain the way they are right now, if the current blueprints remain the way they are right now, if the current drone alloys remain the way they are right now, if mission-running remains this profitable and no other price caps are removed, nothing at all will change.if all remaining price caps will be removed, tritanium will slowly drift upwards, while the rest of the minerals will drift downwards, screwing up the potential revenue ratios even more.if insurance gets removed (or reduced), the entire mineral market will suffer a relatively even percentual drop until the new balance point.if mission-running in highsec becomes roughly equally profitable (given similar skill/attention levels) to highsec veldspar mining, then you might finally see a surge of tritanium volumes, with trit prices lowering slowly but surely to the break-even point between mission-running and mining. but that can only mean a huge outcry from the mission-runner crowd, which, for better or worse, make up a significant portion of the playerbase, so this option is pretty much out of the question.if drone alloys get changed to include a rather equal value composition (base-price-wise) of all mineral types in a typical \"drone belt rat drop\" (not in separate compounds which can be discarded, but in each and every compound), then their influence gets nullified and we go back towards a pre-kali mineral pricing scheme. still, we won't quite get there yet, since the old cheap trit reprocessing options are no longer there, and demand for capitals is increasing the more the game progresses (and that's trit-heavy), so it's still just a mere band-aid rather than a fix.the only two permanent fixes which no longer depend much on the drone regions or anything else for that matter is either the \"alternative blueprints\" idea (which isn't all that great for ore minerals, but it's workable and requires no coding, just the addition of some static data) or the total revamp of the mining system in such a way that all ores are present everywhere, but no matter what you mine, mining that specific ore in a lower \"truesec\" system will always result in more ore of that type extracted.so, there you have it : urgency, because a change introduced a year and a half ago screwed up the mining system, and recent changes have done nothing to fix it, quite the contrary ; and a list of possible solutions, from stopgap measures and band-aids that require little actual work on ccp's behalf, to complete solutions to current and potentially future problems (problems in case the solution presented is not chosen, but only the band-aids applied)."
"the goon on page one had a good idea. need to go wash my mouth out with soap"
"ganking should and is a perfectly valid option. however, ironically those against this proposal keep quoting that eve should have consequences, when they're busy using a system without consequences, namely suiciding.at present if i want to suicide gank a target, i & my friends roll 12 alts, fit suitable ships (kestrels are quite popular), gank the target, collect the insurance and loot, forward both to the main char, and delete the alt.this happens rather a lot. the sec status hit that comes with ganking becomes irrelevant in this case. on the other hand if a kill in high-sec resulting in concord voided insurance payouts, it would at least require sufficient profit to be undertaken.risk vs reward. the gankers should be risking something. the mission runners already are."

"????this statement is so full of fail, its not even funny . . . he is \"role playing\". something we all do everyday... not only that, he's an adult. this thread needs to be locked/deleted...ak"
"well made the pitch and ccp certainly took the discussion seriously, we had a decent discussion on the topic and debated the pros and cons and motives behind it. there are technical reasons why outright destruction of outposts isn't currently possible given the interdependency of programming and database issues (market, clones, etc etc) and we were asked the question of what exactly we wanted to achieve with this proposal. answer to this boiled down to: a) a way for non territory holding alliances to hurt territory holding alliances without becoming territory holding alliances (ie more options in the 0.0 sandbox).b) increased cost of warfare in 0.0 (attrition) making the cost of fighting more significant on the alliance scale.c) reward for \"raiders\" who can take outposts. we were offered a compromise solution around the principle of \"pillageable\" outposts - where forces can take outposts and pretty much strip out the fixtures and fittings (station services) and melt them down into components/minerals etc and ship them out in freighters. this gives a reward for capturing outposts that is useful to roving pvp forces \"space vikings\" and a penalty for lost outposts - reclaiming owners would need to invest again to restore stripped down services. \"bad\" outposts in poor positions on the map could just be stripped out by their owners forcing any enemy groups wishing to utilize them as beach heads to invest isk and materials to bring them up to functional status. i felt this to be a very good compromise solution and was happy that ccp gave the topic all due attention and respect and made the time on the agenda to think through the implications and offer a decent middle ground option in formal debate.made running for csm all worthwhile!"
"i'm slightly disappointed that i didn't find this thread earlier, but there is a better way to change 0.0 stations in my opinion. making them destructible isn't the course of action i'd take. instead, i'd prefer to see all assets in the station lost, and the conquering corporation able to run off with the spoils. i will not deny that is more and more difficult for small alliances to get a foothold in 0.0, but that could be dealt with in other manners - more space, removal of the dreaded local, or congregation with other small alliances. the idea of blowing up stations would bring meta-gaming to a whole new level. instead of \"haha i stole your titan\" it might be \"haha i stole your station, all your assets and then blew it up.\" further more, destructible stations makes reconquering space much less desirable, and leads to less pew pew. this is good if you like the idea of the superblocs continuing to spread like a plague, but it gives small alliances even less of a reason to settle permanently in non-npc controlled 0.0. by allowing conquering corporations to pillage all the assets of a station, i think you'll achieve the desired high-risk eve gameplay, without risking the further 0.0 foothold the superblocs maintain."
"that is why i disagree with the idea of this topic.it would permit the very strong alliances to just go and wreck everything the smaller ones have build so that would be very hard for them to get back the lost areas since to built outposts is a huge investment. on the other side the very rich alliance would hve no problem after devastated the weaker alliance outpost and lead them to go back to empire out of frustraion would have enough funds to rebuild everything at a later time.it has been said also that very big alliances consider certain parts of 00 as crap and they would prefer just destroy everything there and kick out the holders only to leave empty space. because for a big bad rich alliance a piece of 00 may be considered crap but for some opther players it could mean lots of fun and value. with this new idea you destroy the fun of players belonging to smaller more personable corps just because you the big bad mega alliance decided that their space is crap to you but not enough crap top let the guys be. this is griefing and kills the fun for many playrs not beloging to the biggest alliances out there.it generally favors the destructive/non-constructive way of playing. so, not supported.ps and jade i supported you in other threads but i don't think this idea had enough playerbase support to give you the right to go and present it to ccp on that matter for me it was an abuse of power on your part."

"i support this for the simple fact that the chair engages in childish banter with his critics.you dont see real world people of power posting videos on youtube to call their critics names and liars.(not that this has happend with the csm... yet)"
"well here's one this ones even betterthis one is epic slap across the facewe could certainly go on ...but anyways here's the bottom line. ccp recognize that the csm delegates represent different interest groups from the community and its our role to best represent our constituencies. we had an excellent historical lecture on the roots of icelandic democracy during the csm conference and heard ourselves described as \"internet chieftains\" responsible for thrashing out laws and policies in open and passionate debate. this is raw democracy and plain-speaking and its very far away from the sanitized image-politics of idealized process that some on this thread have lamented the lack off. we had a superb conference in iceland and each of the csm delegates did an excellent job in representing their constituencies and supporters and cooperating in addressing critical issues to the game at this time. at the close of business i asked my fellow csm reps if they'd be happy to see me continue as chair till the end of the first session of the csm and got their full support. so thats the deal really. anybody who didn't like the way i've handled the chair position this time around is welcome to stand at the next csm in the winter and who knows, get the support, promote your message, appeal to the voters and get elected and you'll get a chance to show us all how its done. until then lets get back to business."
"in my poor mind it'll bring too much power in the frigate hull.but af need love, definitely.here is what we have discussed many times in the past:first of all, af should have role. then it is time to rebalance (if need).in real world, such ships have application as carrier-based short-range fighters.they are durable, have power, but lack of range and need support mainly in refuelling/repairing.in eve, you can't actually dock to carrier, which is sad...and there are no real role for af... which is sad twice.things can be solved by set of changes. but i'd better ask our fc to explain it, he have very structured and rock-solid view of how it must work.i'll try to post tomorrow."
"it only seems logical."
"i like this idea as something for the drawing board. i'm in favor of anything that keeps the arms race interesting and evolving. taark"
"pay attention closely because this is complicated.i trained a long time to get my nano ship as fast as it is. i spend upwards of 300mil on each of my nano ships.the list of ships that can kill my nano ship... happen to take the same amount of training and time it took me to get it.if you want to stop a t2 cruiser with anything not t2, then your delusional unless i screw up when im flying it."
"how inconveniant to be required to use alternative tactics and (shock horror!) change your fittings occasionally"
"supporting for examination. i don't want a complete reduction as some are advocating, i'd like some proper thought as to the problem and solution. goumindong & marcus gideon have put forward some interesting notions from which something could be spun.people are busy arguing about 0.0 causing nano-ships. well sure, and if nano-ships only worked in 0.0 this would be ok. trouble is they work everywhere else too, where the counters that people propose often are not as simple to muster.finally, whilst there is some credence to the notion that 'your insured 20m raven shouldn't be able to kill my 250m uninsured vaga' this isn't really valid logic, given ccp's continual statement 'new players should be just as capable as old players'. new players lack cash and sp, and therefore arguing that the only counter to nano's is to get out of pvp until you've trained & earned more is not a valid one.(tongue-in-cheek) either that, or we get the truth out, which is that older players are vastly more effective and there's no point in pvp and everyone less than a year old should just get back to high-sec npc corps and stop wasting time and giving free kills away i think this proves the entire point of the need for a re-balance. since when has anyone ever tried to argue that nothing but a carrier can kill a carrier, or a battleship kill a battleship? next we'll be arguing that frigates must not be able to kill titans"
"thats the point i suppose, catching nanos does not require a change of fittings...it requires a change of ship to a limited selection that are sucessful only because they have a specific bonus."
"thats completely flawed. should my crappy noob ship be able to take a battleship? can one battle ship take on and kill a carrier? then why should it be that way with nano ships?all i am saying is it is pretty easy to stop them, a decent interceptor pilot can stop nanos real fast, intys take what.... 3 months to get into from the day you start playing the game? but should your t1 destroyer be able to stop me? no. should your big slow bs be able to kill me every time i show up? no.just because it takes a certain type of ship to stop a nano, doesn't mean its broken. it means you have to train a certain type of ship. wow.. imagine that. you dont have an i win button against my nano but either have to use tactics, a few certain ships, or just accept that i will be able to escape."
"actually no an interceptor pilot has very little chance of catching them unless they to also nano setup. which you'll find if you do that your inty goes pop pretty quick.it's a simple fix really. change the agility mod and force larger ships to take much longer to accelerate and then change the mod on webs so that larger ships slow down that much faster.then your little ships can still coast out of web range everynow and then like intended, and your larger nano bs and hac nanos, etc.. have a much harder time escaping a good web."
"on the contrary - my retort to your original flawed logic was perfectly fine. you're now changing your tune that it's all about 1vs1, which is not the point at all.it remains the case that for virtually every ship in existence, a group of other lesser ships can go take that ship down. it rarely matters what ships those are, just as long as you bring enough. such fights when committed to are decided prior to actual combat by fittings and numbers and skill. nanoships by comparison turn this on its head, allowing the pilot to dictate what engagements they fight, and to run away from those that are unfavourable; conversely anti-nano gangs must set up specifically for them, with specific skills and setups, and may even find themselves at a disadvantage because of it.ccp stated their reasons for changing the wcs restrictions as wanting pilots to commit to fights. it seems reasonable to continue this line of thought rather than have a double standard - or will you argue that only the rich and old should be able to not commit to fights?put simply, whilst i empathise with the notion that says you've spent time and money on your nanoship, that is not a valid argument. if it were, we could go back to wow and have levels, where time spent in the game determines how effective you are at combat. i don't think that that is healthy for eve."

"although i strongly oppose too much \"balancing\" and equality in this game, and i love how each race's ships are very different from other races, i do agree that the nighthawk should be at least slightly improved. if not both damage wise and power core wise, at least one of these improvements is needed for sure."

"i'm a 100% caldari-only character but the crappy crane have made me think about training for the amarr prorator. please make the crane more then just a nice looking blockade runner.//eremet"
"not really true with a pg implant, let us assume the crane gets 4 more grid. now if we fit for optimum align times (polcarbs and istabs) including a mwd and cloak and a buffer shield tank i get the following stats:align time / ehp / base speed / sig rad / cargoprorator : 2.3 / 9769 / 250 / 138.9 / 3125viator : 2.6 / 12222 / 266 / 138.9 / 3750prowler : 2.6 / 11618 / 289 / 127.06 / 4063crane : 2.6 / 13895 / 258 / 144.39 / 4375what is striking to me is how much quicker the prorator aligns than all the others but this is balanced by the others having 20-40% more cargo in this configuration.i think +4 power grid and +10% sig rad would be fair for the crane (translates into roughly a 0.1s quicker locking time for a decent hic for example) as it really needs something it is significantly worse at in comparison to the viator and prowler to compensate for its larger base cargo and buffer tank.horses for courses as always, if you want the best ship for a particular job then you need to train more than one race."
"economy: currently planets are pretty much just warp able objects with the cool stuff in orbit around them (belts & moons). issue. flying to empire to pick up npc manufactured pos fuel / maintenance resources. what if we (pod pilots) could scan planets (and maybe moons too) for the resources required to run stations. then had the ability to set up factories or mines in the confines of a tower pos or an outpost to run and control those terrestrial structures, perhaps multiple types of structures per orbital body based on the resources on that body and the type of pos available. this is a huge can of worms but if it is possible it could add a massive new dimension to the player based economy.uranium mines: where you can actually use those slaves that fall out of mission objectives, or if your a softy you could use robotics instead.robotics factories: suitable locations for establishing factories to make these little gadgets. plus all the components that go in them that are currently included in npc markets (electronics which can be used for t2, metals, microchips, silicates etc)cattle ranches: because everyone in their right mind just wants a good steak every once in a while. (outpost maintenance anyone? what do all those docked pilots eat?) exotic dance club: well they need some where to work. and putting them in jet cans is such a waste. oxygen distillery: pos need it, very few planets have it in abundance. that just names a few potentials. all the fuels and npc produced items, could become player produced. additionally create an empire demand for these products based on maintenance requirements for those stations. let shortage and the economy determine purchase prices. while some goods are manufactured in empire they are 'not sufficient' to cover the demands of billions of the empire's residents. basically any item that is demanded or produced by the 4 major empires (or player alliances) to feed and maintain their citizenry and stations, if it can be produced in null-sec; could create a much more vibrant and profitable economy. the advantage to this is that is adds much greater depth to the economy, and encouraged development of nullsec. this could add a new level of sustainability to 0.0 life and make alliances and factions truly independent. in addition to sustainable life in nullec it would serve to tie the alliances to the empires via supply and demand. the disadvantage is that we would all need to train a lot of new skills if implemented, i don't know how to run a uranium mine now or a cattle ranch. additionally it is a massive development project for ccp, probably on par with other major depolyments. comments please. taark"
"how about combining this with the need to buy planet property first ?the real-estate market this would produce could excite once more the industrial playerbase..who doesnt want to own x% of jita 4-4 :p similar to renting offices today.on a more serious note, owning a property would need to mean something.. and your suggestion answers that nicely."
"i have spent a lot of time in nullsec in the past, a significant portion of my eve career. one of our biggest issues was that 'theoretically' we were a self sustaining alliance, we could build our ships, weapons and bullets, but we had to run to empire for everything from oxygen to robotics, in order to prop up that industry. if i was a self-sufficient mega corporation (which is how i have viewed alliances and their corps) i would want to build additional assets in my territory that make me as self sustaining as possible. if pilots had a way to 'create' their own logistics base it would add new dimensions to: the supply and demand (pilot and npc) empire economy, inter alliance warfare, combat logistics, and trade logistics. if npc stations began demanding products for their maintenance (in addition to what they buy now) that could also serve to encourage more trade in empire and more profits in nullsec. other then the size of the perspective sandwich; something like this could add a lot of 'color' to the universe."
"interesting idea. this would take a lot of time to flesh out and implement, but it's an interesting idea and worth talking more about."
"would add a whole new dimention to the game, what about the stations that orbit the planets in high sec?would the npc's who own those stations also own said planet and would you be able to put up a station in high sec if you could get 100% ownership of a planet?tribe"
"excellent ideas. we should definitely be able to exploit planetary resources and the alliances in 0.0 should definitely be able to become self sufficient. i support this."
"pvp is typically a group activity in this game. but when it comes to making isk, that's almost always done alone.in empire, people run level four missions, or they mine low-ends, or they play the market, or they build and sell ships and mods. all of these things are mostly solo activities. sure, you can run a level four with a few of your friends for fun, but the game disincentivizes it, because you make more isk doing it alone.in 0.0, people rat alone, or mine alone, or run complexes alone (using two accounts...), etc. money-making is typically a pretty lonely activity. sometimes someone invites a few friends along to run a difficult complex, but those are pretty infrequent opportunities and only a handful of people are needed out of an alliance of hundreds of players occupying the space.i would like to see the game mechanics push player toward cooperative group-based pve activities for making \"the real isk\". that's the vision.these are things that are not the vision:rare pve encounters that are wildly, insanely profitable but that are tied to specific static locations in space and/or that only support a few players at a time. see static complexes.\"group\" activities that can be completed by some lone wolf with one account running a battleship and a second (or third) account running a logistics ship. see most complexes currently found through exploration.ventures that require groups to do, but aren't worth the time and effort of running with a group. see level five missions (which technically be soloed with a carrier, by the way).ventures that require hours and hours to see through to the end.ventures that yield rewards that cannot easily and immediately be divied up among the participants. see taking a fleet across the map to take a dyspro moon that feeds profits into an alliance wallet that you never see.ventures that allow the participants to be any safer than the sec rating of the space where they are playing allows. if you're doing a group activity in 0.0, then you're just as vulnerable as you would be when ratting...except you'll be with a gang of your friends if hostiles come around!any form of nerf to the current state of mission running or ratting. this is about adding something new to the game, not about taking anything away.if the vision is met, when i log in to the game, there should be multiple groups of my corp-mates who are eager to have me join them in one of several fun, reasonably-lucrative group activities. solo mining and ratting should become the domains of the anti-social and those who don't have enough playtime to complete a group activity. i will no longer need to have a movie playing on another monitor whenever i need to make some isk in eve.what do you think? sound fun?"
"replying to support my own idea."
"this was a huge topic of discussion and covered a while range of subjects. we were able to ask \"is this supposed to work this way?\" (ie are you supposed to be able to jump bridge capitals into a cyno jammed system) and the answer was \"yes.\"ccp did intend it to work this way and it was supposed to represent defense advantage and give the defenders capital superiority. they came back and asked us? do the csm think its current balanced and should defense advantage be lessened and we all (pretty sure) answered \"no\" its not balanced, and the cyno-jammer/jump bridge situation needs to be looked at as a high priority since its not improving 0.0 warfare and is currently very unreasonable in the current state of the game."

"yes but the server would still have to talk to your client to tell your client what colour to paint x's ship when you pass it at a gate, and the 45 people out side jita in horrible pinks and greens and the 500+ fleet battle."

"the simplest method of implementing this would be something like the ships' logs that ccp used to use.when someone kills you and you have kill rights on them, a log book is dropped in your hanger marking that person and the expiration time of the kill rights. whomever has that item in their cargo bay can shoot at the person it is attached too. i implemented something very similar in the nwn world i worked on...these items can be sold via contract or the market, or traded to others. nice part is if someone does attack a target and loses, there is a chance that the contract is either blown up or recovered by the target. needless to say if he recovers it, no more worrying about who is going to be shooting next time simple, effective, minimal coding.edited: forgot to \"support\""

"you do know that posts that don't have a support tick count as 'no' votes? e.g. bumping, or failing to remember to tick 'support' when saying yes. weird, but there you go, that's what you get in a forum with no poll system.i'd call this expansion for the autopilot almost essential."
"do any of you guys actually know anyone who actually does that? i don't. besides, it could only be done with two accounts and a whole lot of logistics (getting your alt in the same system as your main [without implants]). besides, you'd pretty much have to kill people (without them fighting back for them to get killrights) on a regular basis to get a bounty worth podding yourself for, and someone who does that is pretty much going to be a professional pirate (which means, if my theory is correct, that they wouldn't pod themselves for a few million isk). and, let's face it, the current system makes this even easier. so my idea would actually be an improvement. i'm not going to say it's perfect, but it would allow for more in-depth bounty hunting."
"there are now the 10 attribute skills, plus one lonely little learning skill. i am interested in a tier two learning skill that maybe costs a lot of isk (compared to other learning skills, 7-9 million isk?) and would probably require a large training time multiplier (7 or 9?), but pays off with a 3% bonus to training speed, for a maximum of +15% at a training level of 5. this could help close the gap between the very young players while allowing older players to diversify their skills or master others. if a young pilot trains his/her learning skills then adds a potential 25% speed bonus that would greatly help integrating young pilots into eve. the issue becomes balancing against 400,000 titan pilots. comments please. taark"
"i'm a newer player and i have an element of sympathy but i have to say no to this.firstly, the skill times are there to require you to specialise, to pick a few roles to be good at, not all of them. they also tend to require you to experience various roles before you dive into the deep end (start with frigates, move onto cruisers, and so on).secondly, there is no end-game in eve, and the total number of skills to level 5 would take something like 10+ years now. it's the journey that is important, not the destination.thirdly, your argument is fundamentally flawed. eve should be balanced such that old or new doesn't matter. you can become effective at quite a few things quite quickly, a few percentage points here or there doesn't make that much difference. if you're attempting to allow new players to catch old players, this proposal does not succeed, for two reasons.if you want new players to 'catch up', this assumes the older players don't just use this skill to extend that lead. on top of that, what do we do in two years time when the current crop of new players are 'ahead' and the new players want to 'catch up'?"
"another month of grinding learning skills? no thanks."
"if there was no learning skills, then the ranks for existing skills would be less. tbh, more learning skills is a bad thing. if you want ccp to forever maxout everyone's learning skills, with some bonus to those who already trained it up, then that is something that is more intresting."
"the problem is that it's the older players who would be the ones who train the skill up first, thus widening the gap.also, telling new players that they have to spend even longer training learning skills isn't going to enthuse them."
"no, no it wouldn't.learning skills are an unfun and unwanted waste of everyone's time to begin with.if you think the game would be better with shorter train times, make that thread, and you might get more thumbs."
"guys, guys, i think you're missing the point.he's talking about the 12th skill in the learnings tree, the second tier \"learning\", granting an extra 3% (or just still 2%) to attribute values (just like the tier 1 learning grants 2% per level).the most logical option would be to have it a rank 3 skill, costing about 3.15 mil isk (3.5 mil base), having as prerequisite learning iv, and granting an additional 2% per level to attributes.trained to l4 (takes about 2-3 days), it would pay off in around one month or so."
"no, we knew exactly what he meant.it's just that it is a really bad idea."
"i'm a middle aged pilot. and i am pretty sure that about a year ago there was something like 11 years worth of skills to train in eve. so there is no shortage of upper limit. i would train something like this to about lv3-4 because there are dozens of skill sets i am still interested in exploring. if someone is not interested in additional training that is nothing anyone should care about let alone hold against you. but i would love the training boost because i want to do more with what i have. i would just like to have the option open to anyone to choose for themselves."
"why? you're not forced to train it"
"oh god no. here we go again with the \"you're not forced to train it\" crap. no you just fall further and further behind everyone else. like starting the game 4 years later then everyone else isn't a big enough of a disadvantage. every new player i encounter spends the first month or so training learning skills and perhaps a few other skills along the way. i know i sure did, and hated it, nearly quit but anyway..... this would greatly widen the gap between new players and old because the older players who already have hac's , hic's etc. already have maxed their training skills ( gunnery , etc) and will simply train these new skills faster ( +5 implants)and thereby further reducing their training times and widening the gap.i do see your point though, maxed players will diversify, mid range players will catch up. but that doesnt work for the real new players.and yes, good luck balancing that with cap ships. attributes are much more important to the higher ranked skills...i appreciate your idea but i'm afraid i have to give it a big thumbs down. honestly i wish there were no damn learning skills."
"in reverse:first, no, if an older player can afford the +5s that far out strips the fractional increase i'm talking about. second, build into the system is diminishing returns for higher levels of training. so the \"greatly widen the gap\" as you put it becomes mute. if you train battleship to 5 as an older pilot it will probably take you 35-50 days depending on your skills and implants, a younger pilot would be able to finish the learning skills to a reasonable level and start training into cruisers and those weapons in the same time that the older pilot spends on battleship 5. big deal, the older guys can either train multi racial ships (which coincidentally would place them again at the same level as the young pilots) or they train some long skill and the young pilot trains learning and is pvp capable before the older guy gets that additional 5% \"whatever\" from that fifth level train. i think something like this would help modestly with the larger ships like you mentioned because if you have a base atribute of 20 and you get a 10% bonus from learning plus another 10%-15% from what i propose (lets say 20% bonus total) that means your result is about a 4 point increase from 20 to 24 on your attributes. learning skills don't just help the dedicated planning / skill nerds like me. they help everyone who plays and wants to plan their skills further then a few days."
"actually people with +5s would get more out of your uber-learning skill than those without them. the learning multiplier applies to implanted attribute points just as it does to natural points.your scheme would increase the effect of +5 implants from +5.5 up to +6.25."
"any new learning skills are welcome in my book! ^^"
"at worst, you progress at the same rate (or at a similar rate).however, percentually speaking, you get an advantage as a new player in \"catching up\", percentage-wise, with the old players.then they're stupid. with the revamped system we have right now, there's absolutely no reason to go with anything but \"all l4s\" in the learnings, and that's done in two weeks tops.given how a lot of l5s are \"mandatory\" for advanced skills that are not even that great, and how l5s take almost 5 times longer than getting from zero to l4, that means every little percentual gain means a huge actual performance difference gain.do you think t2 ships are all that great compared to t1 ships ? seriously, think again... other than specialist niche ships, they're not significantly better than the t1 versions, it only seems that way to you since you have much better support skills now.for something that takes 2-3 days to train, but boosts training speed by 8% (or even 12% if you go with the 3% per level version), at worst you can talk about older players getting l5 in it as opposed to not getting it at all. so, at worst, you're looking at the \"older\" player learning at 2%/3% faster comparatively... however, the lower guy just got a significant boost in training speed for minimal extra effort, which will allow him to bridge the gap between \"useless\" and \"usefull\" that much faster.sure, the older guy will finish his third l5 battleship or his second dreadnought l5 faster too, but who the hell cares ?"
"actualy the developers have spoken on the topic repetedlyaccording to them the net effect of the leanring skills were entirely negative1) it bascialy becomes the \"first\" skills learned meaning that players end up defacto frozen while their learning skills catch up. granted the \"new player\" experience has helped in that a lot of skills were added, but they have also talked about ways to \"get rid\" of the learning skills (either by auto granting full learning skills or allowing the skills to level up parallel to a non-learning skill) this has been seen as a bad thing by the devleopers because of comments in places that have public coments on mmos you see coments about how your stuck with newbiskills for over a month while you learn the \"learning skills\"2) all skills implimented since then were placed 1 or more levels higher simply because they had to factor in the faster learning skills. bascialy their idea is that you have to choose how you specialise yourslef, not make it so that you can play the \"flavor of the month\" game every day."
"to be blunt i dont have a problem with the idea of them adding more points to the skill stats. but i do realise the problem from the developers point of view when it comes to adding new skills."
"forgot the third and fourth point3) even the fact that the old skills are able to be leanred faster is a negative because with the new skills being set higher than they would have been without the learning skills, the new skills ended up being a barrier to advancment.4) the frustration factor of someone who thought they would be playing for a period of time and thus planned accordingly with their learning skills who leaves early (thus waisting time with learning skills) or late (why did i not train this learning skill 1 more level!)"
"they're not stupid, they're obsessive-compulsive :p"
"sorry but i'm on the if there is ever a safe way to replace learning skills to do it list of people.like removing advanced learning skills and making implants go up to +10 replacing all current in-game implants with times 2 the number current. so +5's become +10sthen it becomes part isk grind in which players would be able to earn them while learning the basic skills. so you could in a way get both at once."
"discussion on bombs ended with the outcome that they are currently too expensive, and too difficult to employ to be cost effective in the current eve environment. they've been sent back to be looked at as a priority by the balancing department and i'd hope to see the cost of manufacture reduced and changes to allow the bomber to launch them from a little further off (to give it better chance of escape). bottom line we flagged it as a neccessary balance issue and registered opinion that they are not working correctly on tranquility at the moment."
"this one came up for debate - ccp didn't want to interfere and said it was a matter for the csm to decide. the csm itself wasn't keen on writing the principle into the rules/constitution for future csm's and the general outcome is that any future csm can pretty much decide for itself how it wants to govern meetings and debates. we did clarify that the documentation will be changed so that chair's can step down and be revoted if they wish. at the end of the formal meetings in iceland i asked for a formal show of hands on whether the csm reps were happy with me continuing as chair for the first term and they all said yes. so thats pretty much the end of that. next csm will have the chair decided on majority vote but there will be some clarifications in the csm document to clear up the rules and ability to decide these offices."
"thanks - anyone else?"
"nothing wrong with scorched earth. there should always remain the opportunity to deny your foe loot (and if you care about such things, killmails).extending the timer is pointless unless there is no way to cancel it. otherwise the moment you enter combat, you turn it on and then cancel it when it looks like you're going to win.from a purely economic view, the use of self-destruct has no impact on warfare. the pilot is still out a capital ship and the modules. if your intel is any good at their job, you won't be relying on killmails to estimate the economic damage of your fights (not with these tactics about anyway). if you want to make a case that self-destruct impacts your isk revenue from loot, then make that case."
"i read a post on another thread and i thought of this idea: to introduce scripts for the damage modules aka for the ballistic control systems, magnetic field stabilizer,gyrostabilizer,heat sink it would work as followsi will take a heat sink ii as example.case 1 without script it would work as now 10% damage increase 10% rof increasecase 2 with damage script it would go 20% damage increase 0% rof increasecase 3 with rof script it would go 0% damage increase 20% rof increasesince as we know 20% rof > 20% damage in dps this would ensure that some people would prefer to use rof in cap stable ship setups but the ones that would like better alpha/lower ammo consumption would go for the damage script even if in the long run would give them lesser dps to rof script. that would offer variety and would help with the artillery problem as well to some extend. so what you think?"
"how is 20% rof better than 20% damage? 20% damage has a higher alpha, same dps (better when you figure in reload time), and lower ammo consumption."
"it'd be a boost to damage mod stacking, on the whole - you can separate them into independant stacking queues, making them half as nerfed. ships that have the slots could quite conceivably fit 6 damage mods if they wanted to get added dps - i don't have the numbers at hand, but i imagine 4 mods under your system would be better than 8 currently, and 6 would be far and away better, since they're still operating at better than 50% efficiency. because 20% doesn't mean the same thing in those two cases. assume a gun that does 10 damage every 10 seconds, or 1 dps. the +20% damage would make it 12 damage every 10 seconds, or 1.2 dps. the -20% rof would make it 10 damage every 8 seconds, or 1.25 dps. mind you, the higher alpha, lower ammo consumption, and lower cap use do compensate for this somewhat, but for raw dps on a single module, the rof mod is simply better."
"wow, my math-fu is weak tonight.wouldn't that kind of defeat the purpose of having the stacking penalty on them in the first place?i am not supporting. the modules that were given scripts were done so because they give two different types bonuses. sensor boosters increased targeting range and targeting speed, whereas weapon upgrades give rof and damage which are both factors in a single stat: dps."
"these might work better as rigs:+10% dmg (moar alpha) for -10% rof (shots take longer) -or-+10% rof (less time between shots) for -10% dmg* it would have to not be stacking penalized with current dmg mods* <racial weapon> rigging could reduce the penalty down to -5%.as it stand the current rigs are fairly useless with the way they stacking with dmg mods and effect grid/cpu. its rare you have the grid/cpu to spare and have less than 3 dmg mods already."
"no i was not intending to skip the stacking penalty this way. the stacking penalty would work per module not per script. so even if one would put 2 gyrostabilizers ii with 20% damage script + 1 gyro ii with rof script he would get the same stacking penalty as with 3 gyros without script as it happens today. and about the specific percentage amount increase the script gives it may seem stupid to use the rof but the increased rof could be more beneficient to guns that contain lots of ammo like autocannons in pvp where the artilleries could get benefited by the increased damage.and the exact values could be different. the scripts could be set as (+50% damage , -50% rof, so the current 10% damage 10% rof gyro ii, would get to 15% damage 5% rof with damage script and to 5% damage 15% rof for rof script so to tune down the extreem alphas and the high ammo consuptive rof.anyway, it was just an idea."
"0.0 is pretty bland. except in absolute quality, there isn't much variation between one region and the next. this comes with a problem: a few conquerable regions are good for everything: they have buckets of every sort of mineral needed for building, and excellent rats. i think that needs to change. i am not advocating making all regions equally good (as opposed to the current situation of many being equally bad), simply nuancing the hierarchy. rather than poor (geminate, every region between deklein and fountain, great wildlands (not conquerable i know, but still crap), providence etc) and awesome space (delve, deklein, fountain etc), i would like to see different regions being best for different sorts of resources.in short, i propose that \"stuff spawning mechanics\" be adjusted so that different hierarchies develop. so regions a, b and c might be the best places in eve to mine but d, e and f might be the best ratting areas (outside pirate 0.0) as opposed to a, b and c being best for both mining and ratting. in fact, the nuance can go further. maybe d, e and f are best for high end mining, but g, h and i receive special extremely high yielding variants of low end ores.first, however, a couple of general changes:systems exist where one is lucky to encounter even a single npc bs spawn, and the ores are barely better than in empire. this should be changed in two ways. firstly, ore quality and rat quality should be decoupled. secondly, the general quality of rats should be improved throughout 0.0. as a baseline, id suggest that 25% spawns in any 0.0 system should contain at least one bs. decoupling ore and rat quality is necessary for my proposed 0.0 adjustments, while generally increasing rat quality makes all 0.0 worth settling in for a time, even if its just a small corp moving in for a few days ratting.higher yield ores are also improved. instead of offering 5-10% more yield, they offer +15-30%.on to the meat of the matter: the following are six different ways in which regions could be strong. note that any particular region can have any combination of the following characteristics. super regions are still possible and desirable: they give players somewhere to aspire holding, but we get rid of armpit space. that is simply not good for the game. if players can't make any money, they'll never be able to challenge for the good stuff. a region should always have something worthwhile, but that is not to say that certain regions shouldn't have more good stuff than others.the first category of space is the low-end rich, high-end poor 0.0 area. this space may not have large quantities of high ends and if it does, those ores will only be found in a few places, while concentrated versions will not be present at all (and maybe there will only be flawed (-15% to -30% yields) versions of the high ends as well). however they do have especially concentrated low and middling ores (+50% yields or even more). obviously different regions might have different concentrations of the various low or middling ores. rats are average unless the area is designated a particularly good ratting ground.the second category of space is the high-end rich, low-end poor area. this space is pretty much the reverse of the previous category. abcms are abundant, but low ends are only available in standard or flawed variants. the +50% super ores of high ends exist, but are very rare indeed (perhaps only harvestable from gravimetric exploration sites). rats are average unless the area is designated a particularly good ratting ground."
"the third category is the good ratting area. this has a higher than average chance of encountering bs (perhaps 50% chance/spawn of encountering at least one bs as opposed to the basic 25%, this number can of course be adjusted) and is a good place to find the local rat types complexes via exploration. besides being good for raw isk, they are good places to find the named items that are needed for invention (if i remember correctly). unless the area is designated as particularly good for certain sorts of mining, it has the average 0.0 mineral concentration: access to +15-30% low and middle end ores, maybe a few systems with non concentrated high ends. such space might be popular with pvp focussed alliances: they have access to liquid wealth but dont require huge amounts of infrastructure.the fourth category is the good salvaging area. conceptually, it is related to the good ratting areas but come with certain gimmicks. besides having the increased chance over vanilla 0.0 of encountering bs, they have access to two or more kinds of npc, and a higher chance of finding good salvaging sites and possibly mixed-rat complexes (think worlds collide).the fifth category is what i call the luxury area. these areas have an enhanced chance of encountering faction spawns (though they do not necessarily require the increased chance of encountering bs) and also enjoy high concentrations of high end complexes (with all the increased chance of finding deadspace loot that is entailed). making new faction content, possibly t2 faction ships would make these areas particularly notable. a less dramatic gimmick could be t2 faction mod bpcs.the sixth and final category is the specialist industry area. these are the best places in eve to find booster materials or invention requirements. augmented and integrated drone sites might also be incorporated into this category. they may even have a high concentration of salvage sites. of course, a single specialist industrial area will not have all these qualities, itll just have one or two. like luxury areas, these are confined to small areas- boosters are not a great foundation for a territorial alliances entire industry to be based upon. specialist industrial areas are also fairly poor mining/ratting areas.so how would this system change eve? geminate for instance, might be designated a good low end mining area, but have no other notable qualities. delve might become a good high end mining area, with better than average ratting. deklein could be similarly endowed: perhaps it has a guristas luxury area and a good salvaging designation: perhaps it spawns guristas and serpentis together.note that \"areas\" don't have to encompass whole regions. some regions might have no notable global qualities, but instead become a collection of specialist industrial and luxury sites.by diversifying 0.0, it becomes possible to cater to a wider variety of playing styles, and possibly different styles of colonization or alliance mentality could prosper in different areas, possibly leading to culture clashes and the disruption of power blocks. would the pvp alliance in a good ratting region always have common cause with the industrial conglomerate stuffing their barges with +50% lowends next door? what with human risk aversion, this is perhaps an unlikely end, but with 0.0 catering to more than one playstyle, we're more likely to have different sorts of alliances. rather than one sandbox catering to a particular sort of palyer, we have several interlinked sandboxes where the rules are slightly different.i deliberately make no reference to moon minerals. these are an existing way of nuancing space and i don't think dramatic redistribution is necessary. that said, where a region has 20 or more high ends, i think the balance might be skewed too strongly."
"signed (how ironic)whilst we're on the subject, why have this forum, or more accurately, why have discussion in here?surely it would be a heck of a lot simpler to have each issue be a link to one already in features & suggestions (where the rubbish ideas usually get blasted because the people who care are there looking) and just a yes or no here?i guess my point is, this is where issues are presented, but we now have two features & suggestions forums to check.edit: doubly ironic - managed to lose the support bit by editing."

"agreed, missions, fw, etc npc jammers should work like pc jammers."
"agreed. but i need to say something on this. i have noticed that when i use eccm the enemy npc jamming is reduced severly compaired to non use an eccm.for example i did once a lvl 4 against guristas on a drake with my other character without eccm and i was like permajammed with intervals of a few seconds only. when i did the same mission with a bs and eccm on this character i could comfortably do the mission. i would get the occasional jamming here and there but nothing irritating. so maybe after all the eccm works. i can't have been lucky every time. i mean before using eccm the guristas mission were a pain i was simply trying to avoid them cause i was permajamed. now that i use eccm i do them regularly without much jamming. in any case i vote for yes."

"same mission, same conditions, same sensor strength. warp away, dock and return. you will see that the number of successful ecm change. it has more to do in breaking a session where the rng was throwing a lot of extreme results than in having or not eccm. at least in the word of the devs eccm has no effect whatsoever on the chance of npc ecm to blind you."
"agreed, and can't see any good reason why not."
"you should be able to change your skills anyway on singularity"
"not the corp deletion, but removal of standings to that corp if ceo/directors haven't logged in for 3 months.for alliances, if there are no alliance ruler out there for the same time.that way, corps will have their standing slots freed without bothering to check if the subjected corp/ally alive (shall i prefix it with \"still\" clause?)p.s.would help dealing with zombies too..."
"news flash, as far as i know none of the implants that give bonus to boost amounts or duration work for capital size modules or ships. the only thing that works is the implants that increase cap, armor, shield and the like. i think this is probably a known issue and ccp likes it that way for some reason."
"sigh. i wish sirmolle was on the team! at least he knows how to really communicate with the playerbase!"
"the next election should feature antivotes, forcing people to be accepted by several groups and not just one wouldn't be bad.i really hope jade constantine is the next christoph blocher. (you can find that on wikipedia :p)"
"goons are a cancer on eve, end of..."
"honestly: this!i am particularily proud of jade though who was my vote! but all seems to come around nicely!a good thing though is no one is acting as politicans: arse kissing that is! heated discussions are good and straight speaks is something i set very high!"
"eagerly awaiting minutes/list of rough time line and or reasons why issues are not feasible."
"sweet! (still has dreams of working at ccp so i'm very jealous :p)also the forum for the minutes is dead :p"
"haha my better part thinks she can eat it without an issue :p"
"i expect things to go uphill from here.good show, csm!"
"there's a fetish for that if you two are interested."
"i have read two articles giving both sides' view of the csm meeting that just took place in iceland. the first is the csm view--read it here. the second is an interview of a ccp representative--read it here.assuming you've now read both, what do you think?i think ccp's view of where csm should be working and csm's view of itself are two different things. it appears csm went in with a list of items the players want fixed (most of which ccp was already aware of and have in the pipeline to fix). ccp wanted to hear from them big ideas of where the game should go next.i have definite ideas of where i would like to see the game go next. i haven't heard any plans past ambulation yet from ccp. i think its high time to introduce planetary activities to eve. to begin with, they don't need to be much different than stations. you land at a spaceport and do station type things as well as interacting with the planet itself. i see room for all kinds of businesses players could engage in on planets. everything from farming to factories to planetary mining (opening up all kinds of new ores and minerals). i see opportunities for players to terraform uninhabited planets and plant colonies there. i see new resources for players to fight over, and new ways that system control can be established. in short, i agree with ccp's view of things--we need big ideas from csm, not bug fixes."
"i can agree and appreciate ccp's view on what csm should bring up. i think it was inveitable to bring up \"smaller\" issues in terms of vision. also, i think the big issue this time, as expressed by several council members(internet chieftans), was the lack of expectations that ccp has openly set towards the council. we can hope that people will start thinking \"big\" after reading the interview with noah. i urge anybody who has good ideas for where eve should be heading over the next few years, to post on the assembly hall."
"i think it would all depend on which employee they interview regarding what ccp wants from the csm. each department head at ccp would probably like to see how players feel about things that department may have control of, not just the future design of the game.the only thing i don't like is when noah says \"some little niggling ui issues and that kind of stuff\" if the players felt it was important enough to talk about then it is not some little niggling issue, whatever the issue might be.at first i felt that this was nothing but a pr stunt but i still voted. my opinion has changed about the csm and i hope that the players, the csm and ccp can work together and really accomplish something."
"i think this shows that the usual forum crowd are out of touch with how things work.they have these illusions that the devs do not read the forums, and because the devs do not post in whine threads they are no aware of the issues. of course they are aware, i will question your intelligence level if you seriously believe they are not.you know arguments like \"that is not what eve is about\"? with the csm we, the players, actually have a saying in what eve is about and where it should go. not that we can dictate it, but we can inspire the developers with good reason and creativity.bickering about the ui or nano-whines are not inspiring at all, contrary it is rather boring because you are already aware of these minor issues, that not even all can agree to is an issue.btw. i like the concept ideas for cosmos 2.0, bring it on."
"frankly, i would like to see a lot more discussions on the gsm forums involving topics on these two pages.btw. the csm should have been poking ccp about an update of those pages"
"i was really dissapointed to not see my revamp of satation undocking pointed voted into the csm docutrine. i still believe this was one of the idea that ccp was looking for, a complete rework of something, looking ahead and such. even then that idea wasn't very big, but if i had posted about my idea of letting players walk in space well... i think i would of of gotten flamed silly :pstill i'm going to run next time anyways under this banner of major game changing suggestions to bring to ccp. i believe that the newer players however are where all these idea will come form as even myself as a trhree old player will see old issues before future ideas sometimes :phowever it's important to get the incomming (as in 4-8 month player) players ideas on what direction eve could go after ambulation or within it.so now that i have a passport i'll be running, and hopefully you guys will see me at the fanfest this year too :) in which maybe i'll run a little campaign booth :p"
"i'm going to dis-agree as to the reasons for the difference in vision. the biggest reasons we (as a community) are bringing up the smaller scope issues is that we dont' know where these annoying issues are on cpp's development schedule. on any particular issue we don't know where they stand. therefore instead of working on future ideas and grand vision stuff we're stuck squeaking on the the stuff that may or may not be in the works. cpp and the csm are going to be stuck with these issues from the community unless we have a better idea on where they are going.now i can understand the wish to keep certain things close to their vests in order to surprise us with \"fun new things\" or to keep the market from \"insider trading\" issues. but for the stuff that's not covered by those two, we only get advanced warning of stuff when a dev blog comes up. cpp has let the section after the patch notes grow very stale. so we realy have no idea what's coming in the long, medium or short term, nor do we really know what systems (or ships) cpp is keeping an eye on with regards to future balancing changes.therefore cpp is going to receive a lot of stuff that they can honestly say \"yes, we're working on it\". to which the community replies \"yes? news to us.\".it's still a transparency issue. now, i'm not knocking cpp as they are much more transparent than, say, blizzard. but there is still going to be some duplication of issues, due to lack of awareness of development direction on the part of the community."
"thank you lavista. i voted for you to be on the council and i believe you guys are going to do a good job. it was inevitable that this thing would start slow, but i believe it will be something big as time goes by."
"while press releases (even by actual members of the csm rather than a neutral observer) are all good and well, it is the actual implementation of these which will still prove wether the csm is actually effective at all or still a pr thing, and tbh im holding out of any further comment until i see a full list of the minutes from the meeting with ccp.its always been noted the ccp prefers to take the opinion of the majority rather than the minority which the csm still is which is why they never solely operate on the forums influence, and the csm is more a representative of the forum population than the in game population."
"my big question after reading about ccp's vision for the csm is how the csm is supposed to handle making these big-picture suggestions. should they be issuing a \"priority-list\"? looking at that planned features page, it's all well and good to be adding all these cool things to the planned features list, but what it comes down to is which one happens first?"
"i was quite disappointed by noah ward's interview. to me he seemed to be coming over sometimes as extremely jaded and not at all enthusiastic, and other times as a bit of a pompous ass. i think that giving the csm no real guidelines in what was expected of them and then to complain about what was delivered is a bit hypocritical. it's like hiring an artist to paint a picture, and when it's finished saying \"oh, you've done it in an impressionist style, i wanted it cubist.\" after all, it would just have taken a one sentence note \"by the way guys, we would prefer you to look at big game-changing ideas rather than niggling little things.\" these presumably are the sweeping plans that (as he was *constantly* reminding the interviewer) take years to implement. i'm sure interest in the csm would wane if the first delivery of items raised wasn't until 2012.fact is though, what was presented was a fairly decent cross section of what the players actually care about (albeit truncated due to time and feasibility constraints). i personally couldn't really care less about faction warfare - its impact on me has been pretty much zero; right now i can't really be bothered with ambulation - but i don't know enough about it to make an informed decision. however, what i do care about is how irritating <insert minor ui tweak here> is, because that constantly affects me in game.sometimes it's the little things that make your game stand out above the others - it's a dangerous thing for your player base to play the game in spite of reasons x, y, z. if their tolerance for those issues is eroded over years of them not being addressed, you've lost a chunk of players because you were so busy focusing on the bigger picture that you let the little things get away unfixed.but hey, what do i know - i'm not a game designer (at least not a computer game designer, i've done plenty of the pen & paper variety), i'm just someone who has to deal with the end result as a consumer."
"i wouldn't get too despondent about that interview. we really did go into the csm process pretty blind and were making a lot of this stuff up as we went along in a really tight timescale in an environment of immense forum background noise and we still ended up with excellent discussions and great engagement with ccp. one of the areas we'll definitely improve next time around is simply giving ccp much more advance warning of the agenda items which will let them appropriately categorize the \"niggling issues\" and \"big vision stuff\" - many of the small issues just needed a \"yes/no/technically impossible\" style feedback and didn't need a formal discussion slot on the agenda. i think thats why noah was saying it was a bit disappointing to see those things taking up face to face time at the cost of the big picture development issues. next time around we'll still have room for the ui fixes and little things but because we're submitting them well in advance those will probably come back with a simple list of outcome that doesn't really need talking about in depth. part of this is a learning process for all of us csm, and eve player base too. going forward from here we're going to be able to give you example issue submission texts (that worked) guidance on what kind of things we can do, what kind of things we can't, and how to effectively word and present the proposals you want going forward. and end of the day we're going to improve the csm process for everyone."
"and you did a great job you guys :)"
"\"little niggling ui things\" ... **** you, what do you expect the issues to be? issues will always be the stuff that you don't fix sometimes for years. apparently, you're aware that certain aspects of the game are issues, but the fact that we've been complaining about them doesn't mean you'll fix them, and you want us to bring up grander things.fyfg (fix your game), and we'll talk.you want the csm to filter the signal from the noise... they have. things we've said need attention are the damn signal, not the noise.edit: i guess now we know how ccp feels about us and our silly issues. you know, the things we've spent the past month or so arguing passionately about."
"no, he was saying that because pointing out problems with the game in front of the cameras is bad. he wanted philosophical discussions about game design, which makes ccp look smart and on the cutting edge of game design. he didn't want issues, he wanted ccp to look good on tv.they are on the cutting edge of game design, btw, but damn it, the bugs and the parts of the game that are crappy just pull them back and annoy us to no end too. technical prowess doesn't trump lack of polish; dunno why they haven't learned that by now."
"a may be in correct in saying this ... but why is item 10 in this list of issues to be raised?reading through the linked thread it seems that most of the respondents disagreed with this suggested idea."
"i believe bane said he would try again next session. there are 2 more sessions not at iceland but with ccp with our current csm's."
"totally agree"
"serenity, did you just take the updates i made before, or did you go through and get all the new ones too? also, make a category for topics that have already been taken to ccp and dealt with. we really don't want those ones coming up again, because doing so seems useless. not sure if that should be a new thread or how you want to organize it, but there should be a list close at hand somewhere."
"i did all the updates from before, then asked the mods to make more room for categories, as most of the posts were now full. so now there is more room :)good idea on the ones ccp has already dealt with. i'll re-organise the content to make that next to the index."
"since mission running is my thing ...missions & agents, suggestions for improvement[issue] small changes to make missions more funplease can you add to the relevant section?ta muchly :)"
"added!"
".... nvm."
"epic fail, ccp.it's one thing to increase prices, but trying to hide it by claiming the removal of time code options is to conform to \"industry standards\" is pretty dirty.i'm also concerned about what this means for subscription rates. will players only be able to pay in 60-day increments there, as well? if not, what is the rationale behind giving some players a range of paid time and pricing options and taking it away from others?if you need more money, raise prices across the board and be transparent about it."
"most of players wants ability to be in one system with 1000 others without fear of lag or dc`s. if lag issues and dc`s was things of the past, less people would whine about this raising prices. \"ok, you solve problems, fixed bugs and exploits, did everything to make game more enjoyable, here you go i don`t mind price raise.\" <you would have much more this kind of answers, but sadly this isn't my imaginary world."
"this situation needs to be revised. an open discussion gets my vote."
"tbh i dont play this game to look at stuff in the stations, i play to blow ships up in space. make this add on optional and charge more for it. dont charge people for something most will not use or wont bother with after they have spent 10mins or so looking at itbring back 30/90days even at teh higher european rate"

"why not give every single player the choice to decide if they want to pay for that quality or not?! why force us to pay extra for these new features and expansions? why not give us the option to \"buy\" extra features and expansions only if we choose to? it would be a great plan:players who want new content pay more for it, and players who don't pay less and retain the option of buying cheaper, short term tcs. that's better than losing players completely, no? i would rather pay $30-50 every time a new expansion comes out, instead of it being forced upon me along with price hikes and removal of convenient options such as buying 150mil isk 30 day tcs.so far, it \"might\" be still possible for me to grind 400mil for 60day tcs every now and then in between paying with my credit card. however, if that option also gets removed, which i can see happening, it's \"bye bye ccp. it's been fun while it lasted\". either way, i will now be forced to renew my subscription much less often than i used to. if anything, ccp should give us the option of an unlimited skill queue. they could at least give us that much given the recent events."
"agreed."
"i don't know if it is already mentioned but players playing the game trough steam still have the option to buy 30-days for 14,95 usd. can ccp explain this?"

"supported with the proviso that sovereignty holding alliances are excluded.i think that this would better reflect ccps vision of 0.0 alliances as factions in their own right and avoid the possibility corps belonging to such alliances taking factional warfare breaks to keep board pvpers happy. i believe ccp are right in thinking that this would distort the intention of fw. at the moment an alliance is just too convenient from a mechanics point of view (war dec functionality etc.) for empire based groups to forgo. this has unfortunately resulted in many smaller groups ideally suited for factional warfare being denied the chance to participate.what i would like to see eventually is a third tier of player organisation, the player controlled faction. these would have the option of being made up of multiple alliances and would be by definition exclusively sovereignty holding. in other words as soon as an alliance claimed sovereignty it would become a player controlled faction and as soon as it lost its last system they would be bumped back down to a plain old alliance. they would of course be barred from factional warfare. tt"
"prove he is the only one to receive a ban over posting personal info.if people had really had an issue with how ccp had behaved over this and many other issues they would have voted with their wallets long ago, its not exactly hidden from new players either so that argument that people have invested too much into eve to walk away over such an issue doesn't really hold as the growth of the game wouldn't continue if people really did object strongly."
"the only one we know was banned for it, as the bans are private. posting what you have posted is against the eula, like saying that player xx was banned for so and so.for all we know there can be thousand of players (and probably there are some teen of them) banned to posting real life informations. kug was the only one making his ban know through outside forums from all i know. that is the difference."
"just because people haven't quit eve doesn't mean that the wrongful banning of players should be ignored. your argument is trying to say because people still play eve means that everything ccp does is right. also you are wrong when you state that this isn't exactly hidden because almost all talk about ********** gets deleted pretty quickly and in order to find anything about it you would have to go back through years of dev blogs."
"prove me wrong then because like you said the details of a ban are hard to come by and kept private. it would require me to have access to the records of all bans to prove my point but much easier for you to prove yours so find me a case where another player posted real life information on the forums and got a permanent in game ban."
"that's not how it works. i don't come up to you and say \"there are a thousand unicorns hiding behind jupiter, prove me wrong.\" if you assert something, the burden of truth is placed on you. you have to prove what you're saying is fact, everyone else doesn't have to prove otherwise."
"you made a categoric statement but offered no evidence to back it up, then claimed you couldn't and say that its much easier to counter your argument, because its more likely that there's evidence supporting the counter to your original argument... so in effect your saying that its far more likely that there is more than just one person that been banned for posting personal information. so in effect you've said your original statement is highly unlikely. that kinda also brings doubts to everything else you've posted in this thread and seeing as you the op, kinda makes me doubt the founding of this thread full stop if your willing to counter your own arguments. going back to your original post, it gets harder and harder to see your point, yes kug revealed what was going on, he did the community a service there not gonna dispute that. the methods are questionable not for me to comment on. but how he acted on the forums even with the best of intentions was still a violation of the eula and tos. in no way does his previous actions for the community exempt him from the rules, if you make one player exempt you open the floodgates and every tom, **** and harry will be demanding they be let back into eve because what ever they did was in the best interests of eve. in some ways its comparable to vigilantism a vigilantly is still a criminal subject to the law even if he's acting with the best interests."
"quite hard of hearing? it is prohibited by the eula to discuss bans on forums so you will not find information about bans, especially perma bans in the forum.got it?most players will not discuss perma bans outside the eve forums so you will not find information on who was banned and why.only those like your hero that will start whines saying \"i was unjustly banned for revealing several people personal informations\" will be found. and ccp will not comment in those outsider forums or in the ccp forum on that."
"the evidence that i can provide is other people posting real life information about others and not receiving bans because of it. kug got banned for posting the real life information of other players on eve-o. other posters have posted real life information of others on eve-o and remain in game to this day. now i was incorrect in stating that he is the only one to receive a ban for this because its impossible to prove. i can state that its extremely hypocritical to ban some for this action and not ban others as well. my point is kug is not the only person known to have posted real life information on eve-o but he is the only person known to have banned for it therefore it is completely ridiculous to ban him for it."
"/supportedpeople should have the ability to queue up skills as long as their subscription is active. after the subscription expires, the last skill in training should continue to train till the end just like it is now, but the other skills on the list should then not train until the subscription is renewed. however, you gotta admit that even this would be bad for ccp's business.. because people don't have the ability to queue up skills they sometimes waste valuable subscription time due to unplanned circumstances. you might forget to set next skill training or you might suddenly have to leave for a long time. these minutes and hours you \"wasted\" add up. this ultimately equals to you having to renew your subscription more often than you would have to if the skill training process was more automated. i'm sure ccp can see that, and so i seriously doubt they will listen to this idea. i know i definitely wouldn't, if i was running their business."
"i agree with the idea of a single queue spot to allow for skills ending during work or in the middle of the night."
"i would be in support of either one set backup skill or a one skill queue. you could limit the first skill to being under twenty four hours remaining. i would use the backup skill to train something i want to train but its too damn long so you could chop chunks out of it while finishing annoying 3-10 hour skills.i have tons of unfinished skills all over the place on both characters. my time is limited and unpredictable because of work. it would give me more control over training as some weeks i cannot plan when to logon due to real life.i cant wait to see the response and explanation."
"an official response to this subject would be good."
"from my notes of the discussion it was pretty much a yes in the following form: something like ... you nominate a primary and a secondary skill. the primary is the normal training skill and when it runs out it automatically flips to the secondary. this means you get to put the short time-skills anytime you like in the knowledge that they'll flip to a longer secondary skill when they finish. this was seen to address the main problem of short skills finishing at odd times without giving into a formal 5-10 whatever stage skill queue that would just let people never need to login. i think we voted the fix a high priority so hopefully should see action on it soon."
"but i like mining so i want it fixed anyway lol. changing all the bps and fixing mining like this versus just fixing mining was my perspective. that is why i recommended my idea so strongly instead."
"to be fair bimbo did start out saying that calling it a critical issue was misleading. also bimbo did sound for several pages like she was against the idea in total and not just how important an issue it was.does the thumbs up mean we support this being looked into or that we support all of akita t's proposals. they need a second thumbs up option i guess.edit ok and yeah i already voted support figuring it was the this needs discussed option but after 8 pages it gets hard to remember sometimes :p"
"it means what you want it to mean, that's why you have comments.it usually means you support either the idea or the stuff written in the op.in this particular case, the op clearly states that how the issue is solved is of no particular importance, it only states that the issue is urgent and needs \"a looking at\" asap.besides, showing support to an issue only means you want the issue discussed by the csm, which only means the issue might get eventually presented to ccp, not even necessarily in the initial form.in other words, thumbs up means you care to have this issue discussed about (more or less) officially."
"isn't the purpose to carve our own empires. why would being self sufficient be bad. it seems like the point of it all. yes trade has to happen for t2 components and datacores for t2 stuff and pos npc fuels but for everything else we should be able to provide for ourselves. i am the melt it down guy and my wife is the build it back up girl for 70-80% of our in corp production when the troops are home."
"/signed for additional countersi find is ridiculous that someone can freely scan a ship and know whether they will make a profit or not.1)insurance for concord kills need to go.2)skills need to be added and the ship/cargo scanners shifted to chance based according to those skills3)counter-modules for the scanners need to be put in.4)mechanisms need to be put in to allow a support fleet to protect slow, vulnerable ships."
"1) it is a popular suggestion2) ship scanner is chance based already3) there are already counters that make cargo scanning impossible4) webbed instawarp freighters, remote repping support, falcon jammers, scouts?"
"every time i've tried it i've been 100% successful. if it is actually chance based, what skills effect both scanning and counters?gscs and freight cans haven't blocked scans for a long time. what are the counters?1)remote rep doesn't work; cycle rate on the remote reppers is slow enough that at most one cycle gets off before concord would respond as it is once you factor in lock times. plus with the very short range of remote reps on anything but logistics ships combined with the random jump in points you can't bring your reppers to play on the ship you need to protect. 2)falcon jammers cannot counter until the attack is underway or they get concorded, meaning the ship is already mostly dead before they can engage. they are also helpless against gank squads of bss as they can't lock and engage enough targets fast enough to drop the dps to save the gankee.3)scouts works, but there are many places in eve where you have the option of going through x gate or going through lowsec to get to your location. no alternative routes are available meaning if you do find something you can't go around.but this has been covered many times in the 100s of threads on the subject."
"although i hardly operate in high sec these days and i don't believe high sec should be 100% safe i do believe it should be reasonably safe. it seems way too easy and riskless to gank just about anything in high sec.tl/dr version: agree 100% with leandro salazar."

"i do a lot of mission running - it definitely forms the largest amount of the time i spend within eve online. there are a lot of posts on these forums about missions, but in line with ccp's wish for the csm to address more far-sweeping issues, i got thinking about the direction in which missions could be moving.i think that at the moment, the largest problems with missions are that:1) they are relatively static, in that once you have selected the mission, the same things always happen - you kill x structure, it drops loot; you kill y npc, a fresh wave of npcs appears; and so on.2) they can all be done with a single ship set up.3) they have no grander structure. missions with a logical 'next stage' never deliver that next stage, and each time you get the mission, it's all worded like it's the first time.smaller points with missions are:4) very little apparent tie-in between standings and/or agent quality with the difficulty/importance of the missions5) the agents give out inappropriate mission types6) there is not enough variety of mission structure to increase the 'spice'.i believe that unless all of these issues are addressed, then we are basically wasting our time. some of the issues are intermingled - e.g. fixing 1) might have a positive effect on 6). the 'win' here for players is to stop missions being as much of a boring grind, both for the ones running missions as a 'profession' as well as those who are doing it to farm some isk. the 'win' for ccp is that players will be less bored by content and will be more likely to subscribe for a longer period of time.so, to address my points one by one:1) static missions. i propose a solution here of simply randomising the spawns. instead of having a specific set of ships appear, each 'wave' of enemies has a rated difficulty. i.e. a particular wave has a difficulty level of 5. a bs might have difficulty rating of 2.5 a bc 1.5, cruiser 1, and a frigate 0.5 - instead of the spawn being a fixed spawn of 2 bcs and 2 cruisers, throw in the chance of it being 2 bs instead. (these numbers are for illustration only. i'm not trying to say all bs are as tough as each other, or that a cruiser is half as strong as a bs.) you could rate specific named spawns or ship types higher, and also modify the rating depending on the fit - a tackler frigate may score 0.6 rather than the standard 0.5 for instance.also very randomisable are structure loots and spawn triggers. i will credit the forum readership with enough brain to figure out the details without further guidance :d2) single ship set up. this would need some new missions putting in. i have put some ideas on my thread here, but in summary:a) missions requiring a small-hull ship, be it for speed, stealth or other reasons, such as a pirate-hacked acceleration gate.b) new tactics needed - a tackler is required to lock down a ship with too hard a tank to break in order to reach the loot, or the need is to get in and out undetected under cloak.... continued"
"3) some of the issues here can be resolved by a simple re-wording of the mission text so it doesn't read as if it's first time, every time. even a simple flag that gives the current text the first time the mission is run, and then gives text like \"you remember that guristas space telescope you destroyed a short while back? well, they have done it again, the persistent little buggers ...\" etc. and so forth. however, to truly address the issue you'd need to have missions that escalate by mission level. for example, in the fictional mission \"blood raider extravaganza\" the level 1 version might be a handful of frigates in first ds room, a structure + a cruiser (named commander who with his last breath shouts \"this won't be the last you hear of us!\") and maybe a few frigates in room 2; the level 2 version might go to 3 rooms, upgrade to a few more cruisers, and the commanding officer of the level 1 boss; level 3 - 4-5 rooms bcs and tough cruisers, the next boss up + 'secret' room; level 4 ... etc.4) the graduation of missions may well already be in place - it would be nice if it was a bit more visible. i have a standing of 10.0 with my (q19) agent, 10.0 with the agent's corp, 8.5 with the faction... and yet i get a whole string of low value easy missions. i would expect that as you increase standing with the agents/corporations/factions that they would trust you more and give you bigger, better and more important work to do. (i also believe that once you get into the upper 9s of faction standing that they should trust you with the smaller caps as well, but maybe that's just me :) )5) the table of which agent types give out which types of missions is well-established. however, with some of the divisions you may as well not bother. surveillance agents give 95% kill and 5% courier. internal security the same. command gives 97% kill, 3% courier, security is 90% kill, 5% courier and 5% trade. intelligence agents give 85% kill, 15% courier... and so on (percentages based on the table on www.eveinfo.com). if i work for an intelligence agent, i want to see missions where i am actually gathering intelligence. if i work for an r&d agent i want missions where i am testing out experimental mods, or rescuing an npc ship where something went wrong. if i work for an astrosurveying agent i want to do some surveying and exploration... i could go on. fact is, we need more than four mission types (kill, courier, trade, mining) in order to properly supply the agent divisions which we currently have.6) i've mentioned some ideas for some variety in mission structure in the above sections and there are more on my other thread, so i will not repeat them further here. there has to be something more than 'go there, kill that, come back', or go there, mine that, come back'.all of the above is aimed at addressing the boring & repetitive state that missions have come to. i don't like that people can power grind missions using a single ship and a single set up, because they are all variations on a theme. there is some hope on a recent dev blog in which ccp are looking at implementing several new missions, i just hope that they are just not more carbon-copies of what we already have.other things for the future?there are other things to consider for the future of mission-running as well or course - for example, player-created missions. i personally can't see how that would be achievable - eve players are not generally noted for being philanthropists to create missions for other pilots to do... courier missions can already be done, as can trade (market orders).... continued ..."
"i can see a future for mining & manufacture missions based on a contract sort of thing, particularly once it gets higher than individual level. a corporation could set up a contract requesting, for example, 100 million units of tritanium, or 1,000 cargo expanders (or whatever), listing the payment, delivery address and timescales, which could then be accepted by either an ambitious individual or a specialist mining/manufacturing corporation. naturally there would need to be 'default payments' to stop people griefing by accepting these contracts and then just not fulfilling them, therefore denying the target corporation the goods it thought it would be receiving.competition between players for the same mission (idea by morgenrei) - give the same mission to several players at once, either in compoetition to complete the thing the fastest for extra reward, or making an impromptu gang.consequences for mission-running beyond missions themselves (also by morgenrei) - so you've run so many missions your standing with guristas is -9.99 (me!). they are not going to like this. you are en route somewhere, when your warp drive gets temporarily disrupted and you drop out... to find a squad of guristas bs sitting there waiting for you - and they are not happy... give them scrammers so you can escape if you're in a shuttle or something and quick off the mark, otherwise, better hope you're in your mission runner and ready to fight..."
"of course i support more variety and dynamics in mission running.i've just grabbed out an old thread about an idea of player created combat mission i was participated in: mission editor - should there be one?i still like the idea but the different opinions in this thread were quite conflicting."
"1. almost identical to my proposal. 2. i like this idea too, i think i may even have suggested something similar in the features and ideas discussion. specifically, i'd like to see missions that focus more on electronic warfare, stealth, speed, etc.3. interesting, but it seems like a lot of effort to write two descriptions of a mission only to have one of them viewed only once per agent.5. agreed, this is a pretty basic thing but a huge annoyance.you should start a new character as one of the industrial career paths. i believe that they have things like mining and manufacturing (even invention) missions, though they may have changed that recently."
"it's a well-known fact that currently, eve has some of the worst pve content of any mmo with pve content. this is terrible, but i understand that developer time is limited. here are some changes that i think are relatively easy, but would make missions much more interesting overall:1. fewer npcs, better npcslots of small, easy-to-kill npcs are pretty boring, in all honesty. cut their numbers in half, and double their damage and tanking ability.pros:-less graphical lag-slightly more interesting missionscons:-less loot and salvage-increased mission difficulty-potentially labor-intensive to implement (i.e., lots of time making changes to each mission)no more unnamed t1 lootcurrently, the loot dropped by mission npcs consists of 75-90% crap and 25-10% high-end named equipment. this has the effect of destroying the t1 market and reducing the viability of mining as mission-running yields a lot of minerals from reprocessed worthless loot. removing unnamed t1 loot will make looting a bit faster and also yield more high-end items that would make up for the lower volume of loot.pros:-more viable t1 market (less competition from missions)-fewer non-mining sources of minerals-faster mission looting times-increased mission profitscons:-potentially labor-intensive to implement (i.e., lots of time making changes to each mission)mission leaders that retreat unless scramblednpc ai at the moment is insufferably stupid. they'll spend an hour pounding on your ship even when it's obvious that nothing is going to happen and won't retreat after your ship casually blows up two thirds of their force. obviously this is a tricky situation because you don't want to frustrate players and you don't want to generate lag either.a relatively simple change could add some more interesting dimensions to missions is to designate a \"leader\" within a group of npcs. this npc will have a better bounty than normal npcs, and will occasionally check to see how much of his force is remaining (technical details to follow). if most of their force is destroyed, they will attempt to retreat by gang-warping themselves out of the mission area. you can stop this from occurring by warp scrambling them (or alternately, let them go). i don't know exactly how it would be implemented as i don't work for ccp, but as a programmer i believe this can be done without noticeably increasing server lag.pros:-missions become a bit more like pvp-missions are more engagingcons:-may slightly increase lag-potentially labor-intensive to implement (i.e., lots of time making changes to each mission)more dynamic npc spawnscurrently, a mission will spawn an exact number of npcs every time it's played of an exact type. this is one of the main factors that makes missions predictable, and changing this can help make missions more interesting.this could also be done fairly easily. each mission spawn is assigned a point value:frigate/drone: 1 pointdestroyer: 2 pointscruiser: 4 pointsbattlecruiser: 8 pointsbattleship: 16 points[ii]note: these are just sample numbers, real numbers would be balanced by ccp based on damage/bounty values/etc[/i]a mission with a spawn with 50 total points could be spawned as:-1 battleship, 2 battlecruisers, 2 cruisers, 2 destroyers, 6 frigates-2 batteships, 3 cruisers, 2 frigates4 battlecruisers, 2 cruisers, 4 destroyers, 2 frigatesobviously limits will have to be placed on this in order to keep ratios from being skewed too towards small or large ships.pros:-more dynamic mission contentcons:-moderate difficulty of implementation-possible balance issuesi think that these three changes, combined, will make missions more enjoyable, more dynamic, and generally less soul-destroying as they are now. it'll also have some pleasant side-effects for the t1 market and mining. can i have your support on this?"
"please also see my thread here. :)i think my main concern with the above is that if your mission objective is to kill or capture the leader, you would be kinda screwed if he warped out. inevitable response to it will be to kill the 'leader ships' of a wave of npcs before the others, therefore removing the check for them to warp out.also not too sure about the whole loot thing. if you're going to remove the loot you will remove a fairly major source of income for the mission runner, and also stop the new player experience in realising that some of these oddly named things offer better performance than the regular mods. however, if you were to balance that with a revamp of manufacturing to allow for higher quality than normal mods to be developed by higher-skilled players, might work.and i gotta agree with the dynamic spawns thing, since that's in my post too :)"
"thanks, i'll check it out. i've thought about this. the easiest solution is to just not have the objective npc be part of a group with a leader. regarding killing the leader ships before the other npcs to keep them from warping out, this is a perfectly acceptable strategy in my opinion.i should clarify here, by loot, i mean unnamed t1 loot only. so you'll stop getting things like 1mn afterburner 1, but will still receive any of its varieties in the loot table. i'll update the op to clarify."
"sounds like a good idea, but i agree that it might be hard to implement."
"both thumbs down (vote here)one of ccp design directions is walking in stations. the more stations there are the more this expansion will be for everybody."
"supported"
"no way, 0.0 needs more infrastructure, building pos' is a way to allow for regions to remain populated. to allow pos' to be destroyed would mean when an alliance pulls out of a region, all the infrastructure would go with it. . .as it stands, 0.0 needs more infrastructure, not less.and when we take a region and over-extend ourselves in the name of pvp, do you think we would leave anything behind except promo/dyspro deathstars and cyno-networks to have the ultimate advantage? do you think bobwould have left all those stations the goons and reds are living in now if stations were destructable? 0.0 would be a constant state of build and destroy, build and destroy. the only way i think this should be allowed is if you can have lots of stations guns and be able to man them from inside the station. . .but it would have to be amazingly well defended."
"exactly. and moreover lets see what would have happened if that idea was already implemented.lets suppose this situation.a big bad strong alliance of the sw invades the northwest.he has the best means of destruction and manages to conquer one system after another with ease.the problem is to manage to hold all these areas. becasue there is a problem in that. you can't posess so many players to control effectivly all the space you want. and jade came here and proposed something to remediate this.now bob can just go and destroy the outposts of the other alliances then retreat back. the next week the alliances manage to make new outposts but guess what bob returns and destroys them again and again and again till everyone pays large tribute to bob for a non aggression pact. bob wins eve and gets big trophy cup.a week later everyone leaves eve to go play something elseas it is now bob has harder job to do. if they declare war to some other alliance they need great efford to conquer systems because as things are now they give the weaker guys a chance to fight back because the expansion at a very large scale is very hard because you need to be able to hold the systems you conquer and be able to fuel them and be able to defend a large front etc and all that needs big player numbers."
"supported. i think this would make 0.0 combat much more rewarding and exciting.also, give the ability of deploying mannable sentry guns around stations."

"well i appreciate your position on the issue zaran and also your reasoned debate on various other threads but i'd like to comment on this \"abuse of power\" point. the long and short of it is that i stood in the csm elections on a particular manifesto and was presenting myself as a candidate to advocate small unit pvp, dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 0.0 space. i published in advance the kind of issues i'd be promoting and taking to ccp if i won. i got the largest number of popular votes on that manifesto and felt that gave me all the authority i needed to take the issue to iceland. what we need to remember here is that the nine csm's represent different parts of the eve community and not all those parts will agree with each other or see the worthiness of particular idea. the assembly hall forums is a chance for the general community to express an opinion and make a case - but its not absolutely binding on csm's unless an issue reaches the voting numbers required to mandate an issue going on the csm agenda. we have the responsibility to look through these threads and judge popular opinion on a variety of factors. in this my read on the thread is that pretty much everyone who supported the motion in the election campaign posted in support here. pretty much everyone who opposed it in the election campaign opposed it here. there are reasons against well expressed, but there is a lot of just parotting that position and many many alt posts and one-liners that bring nothing to the table. the principle of these assembly halls is that we only register supports - we don't allow votes against, and thats because its not really a \"vote\" per say, its a place to discuss the merits of issues and have them \"seconded\" by members of the community that feel its a good thing to talk about. strictly speaking it would be okay for a csm rep to raise an issue that got \"1\" support (seconded!) and 500 posts of \"not support\" - and it would be for the rest of the csm to represent their own constituencies at the csm meeting level and decide whether it was a valid issue or not. in this case (for example) this thread got 48 supports (which places it mid-way in the supports on issues table for the things we took to iceland) it got 506 responses, of which many were \"not support\" but you do need to take those with a pinch of salt - we know that each player can post with alts \"not support\" - we know its easy to just copy the arguments of others and post \"not support\" for political reasons etc etc. but i'll grant you, it looks on the face of things like a relatively unpopular discussion point. so if that was the case then it would follow that the csm's would reject it right? but at the csm level it got 7/9 votes to escalate it. this represents: 11007 votes (the combined electoral support of the pro-escalation csms)vs1671 votes (the combined electoral support of the anti-escaltion csms)and that does represent a very different picture i think you'll agree. all i'm saying is that don't assume that we (csm reps) will always be swayed by apparent unpopularity on these issue threads. one liner \"not supported\" really doesn't matter in the big picture. good arguments do. i'll say absolutely clearly now that my own personal metrics for supporting or denying escalation on issues has nothing really to do with any number of one liner \"not supports\" but everything to do with good arguments. one good post with well-reasoned critique is worth thousands of negative posts. and at all points i'm looking at these things as: a) does this issue benefit the constituency i was elected to represent. b) will this issue benefit the overall game of eve. c) is this something that i think could be done."
"and ultimately look at the outcome. we took the issue to the ccp, had a decent discussion. i now know that removing outposts from the game is not technically feasible (within a reasonable programming budget due to cross-dependency of other in-game systems). but we do have an excellent compromise solution on the table now involving pillageable outposts. if this question hadn't got raised we'd not have discovered that. so i'm very confident that in the long term this was a good topic to raise and i believe the 7/9 csm vote that represented 85% of the cast votes for the 9 csm reps shows that the system really is working. all the best!"
"this is a good compromise. i like this. as eve gets older and isk because more and more readily available, more outposts will just keep popping up on a whim. all these 'expensive' toys are becoming old hat and far less special.i hope they make it sufficiently expensive enough as well as difficult enough so it isn't too easy either way."
"points taken jade.one more thing though. you mentioned that you got elected for to advocate small unit pvp, dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 0.0 space. which is what happens in real life too. politicians use mild or words to describe much harsher changes they have in mind. and when they get elected with a vast majority of votes they claim that they have the big majority and promote their plans but the truth is that if the people who voted for them knew in advance the whole package of changes things would go much differently. you mentioned that you got these many votes and i can't deny it that if that is the case and you got all these votes of course typically it is as if your vote = 11.000 people. but what i suspect is that you didn't tell them your whole idea of how exactly you were planing to promote small unit pvp, dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 0.0 space. because the terms you used could mean anything and it was very smart of you to use these words. i mean i would have voted for you if i had read these promises. but as you see when i read the whole package of your idea i disagree with it. and i bet that every single of the 11000 people that voted for you for this exact thing had a different initial suspicion in their mind on how this would be achieved. lets see what one would get out of your words.1) promote small scale pvp. people would think that you would help so that things would change so that a small alliance composed of small corps can have a chance against big alliances. what happens with your idea is the exact opposite.2) dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem that could be anything but for certain sounds nice.would i vote for you if i had read that? probably yes, because with the words you used it seemed very cool but whaen i would get to find out what you really meant to do i would disagree. but now it is too late. i still don't know if all these people suspected what your were planing or if they got deceived by your very cool sounding terminology.so i am asking you. had you mentioned the whole idea as it is posted here or only these nice phrase about \"advocation of small unit pvp, dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 0.0 space\" ?i won't get back to it, i am just curious.and that doesn't mean that i don't agree in many other matters you proposed."
"only makes sense..."
"definitely, here's the paragraph i used in my election manifesto - linked below the sig and here on the jita park forumsi was entirely honest about the things i was going to be promoting well in advance. i don't think destructible outposts came as a surprise to anyone who read the election manifesto"
"no support"
"yes we really need a thumbs down option. there is some crap ideas getting peddled here that need banishing so that ccp don't even contemplate them"
"on 2nd thought, i'd like to have the option to post a thumbs down too, but that we still have to post to show support, if you care about the issue, you wont mind if people know what you think on it."
"but if a thumbs down was implemented it may stop the thread being turned into a free for all with people baiting and de-railing the subject which also is not a petition !! umm... forgot to support !!"

"so what you are3 really saying is that you should be able to kill my nano ship.thats what this boils down to.,you think an escape tactic is flawed. that a ship fast enough to outrun a bunch of 'lesser ships' should not be allowed to persist.regardless, anyone who armor tanks an interceptor needs to learn how to fly them, anyone who tries to shield tank an inty needs to learn how to fly them. they only nano! thats all intys do, thats what they are designed for. howe do you not fit 4xod2 on an interceptor? my inty with gang bonuses and no implants goes about 9k. way faster than any non-billion isk vaga. (billion including snakes across the boards.. which for high end snakes is a whole lot more).i understand its aggravating to not be able to catch and kill a solo or small gang of ships. but thats why we build them that way. there are counters, yes they require tech 2 ships. i see nothing wrong with it. when vagas get away from me i say 'damn.. should have caught that fool' i dont start screaming 'nerf nano ships!!!'"
"nanos, ******* invincible:"
"and what do you think will the nanopilot do when he relizes hes getting hit for any significant amount of damage? hes going to get out of range. its not about how to damage nanos, most times even drones can hit them but you cant hold em down. even a overheated domination web only has a range of 19.5 km.and if you neut them they can still use the remaining time of their mwd cycle to gain range.at the present state you need a combination of ships or rapier/huginn to take down solo nanos. if you want to fight a nano gang you will need a significant higher amount of non nanoships to be able to kill them -> blob"
"not supported. nanos are not invincible, unless the pilot is a total idiot.the amount of training and isk spent on those ships should be rewarded with higher survivability. nano is fine, learn to counter it. oh, and yeah, your pve drake will not be good for it."
"not suppoorted.imo nano ships is working as intended and are not invulnerable."
"fit a neut to your bs. wait for them to turn it off (they will due to cap), then neut them, watch them sit as dead ducks with no cap, no speed, no nothing. then mwd to the in a battleship and web them and kill them in 10-15 secs.also note above killmails, nano upon nano killed by a rupture. a ruptureyes, those 6mill t1 cruisers."
"i generally agree with this. as others have said, it's a very complicated topic intertwined with a number of other things but leavings things as they are render small-gang warfare to be very difficult. any interceptor who can catch up with a nano to tackle will usually be taken down in a few shots, well before the rest of the fleet has a chance to catch up."
"not signed.few days ago we took 3 plated bcs (brutix, myrmi, harbi) and an arazu into lowsec to look around. came up against a nano-rapier, nano-curse and a falcon. we disengaged, unwilling risk the arazu to counter the falcon.when we left the rapier was in deep armor and struggling with 2 webs and 2 scrams on it. the myrmi was running low on cap charges thanks to the curse or we would have stayed.our blaster brutix couldn't get into effective range and the myrmi was perma-jammed so didn't get its drones (t2 hammers and warriors) into play but my harbi was having no problems at all ripping into the rapier even before we got the web on it (overheated mwd ftw). if we weren't such carebears and made the conscious decision to leave i would have had that ship."
"couldn't agree more with that statement applied on even a more general scale."
"i dont fly a nano ship but i also do not support this idea there are plenty of affective ways to counter a nano ship yes you have to make a dessision to fly that type of ship instead of another but isnt that what this game is about. choices. if you nerf everything you dont like eventually everyone will be flying one type of ship and one setup because that is the only way the game will be 100% fair. leave the nanos as they are and get over it."
"planet exploitation? it's about time!! it's been lightly talked about in the \"drawingboard fourm\" as a one-day-to-be eve minie rts or something like that. i'll get the direct quote.-----------from the drawing board:simple planetary interactionthe probable first step for planetary interaction, where you can manage planets from a station or other suitable structure.moderate planetary interactionthis would feature flying over planets and interacting with the planetary surface. this will likely follow on from simple planetary interaction.full planetary interactionplanetary rts or other hybrid game form. yarr. the long-term crazy professor phase of planetary interaction.------------i have long drempt of the day this could become a reality. exploitation of planet services (as this thread suggests) feels like the first step in this chain."
"interesting idea, but if implemented it should work both way.it is cutting the umbilical cord between 0.0 and empire as 0.0 will no more need any empire resource, but then empire should stop feeding 0.0 entities with free isks.the only empire resource will become the isk so it stop self spawning in 0.0 in the form of bounties and subsidized insurance. the isk spawned by rats should be substituted by better drops, so that the the ratter final reward will stay the same. doing that 0.0 entities will become rich(er) in assets, but cash poor, so keeping a reason to trade in empire (converting the assets in isks).if that is not done each 0.0 big alliance will become a totally self sustaining entity without any need of external relations."
"you (all) raise some interesting points. this would be a huge can of worms. but i think that it could integrate nicely with some of the planned walking stations and yes i have read the planetary interaction but i think that a more 'precise' use for terrestrial resources would add detail to the eveverse. your point about \"cutting the umbilical cord between 0.0 and empire\" is a head scratcher, now that i have had more time to think about its implications. i think that as a counter balance to the desire to be self sufficient that the monetary reward for marketing goods and services (station parts and food stuffs) to the faction (npc) stations for their station maintenance. there would probably need to be a strong demand incentive in empire for those goods. one method to handle the issue of 0.0 divorcing itself totally from empire space could be the structures needed for terrestrial structures are only produced in stations like caldari steel or chemtech; to build a greater role for those racial corps in the player economy. use a system similar to the one used now for control tower parts where they are best purchased in empire then transported to nullsec. i think that a greater roll for the lesser known corps could make them more relevant in the eveverse, and that would be a good nice side effect. a second solution could be that rarity per region be utilized to assist trade. similar to the moon mineral rarity, not a ridged hierarchy but more like the racial preference for certain results some areas just have a little more of some thing, like uranium vs. oxygen, rarities being reversed over regions. thank you all for your positive feed back so far."
"interesting idea that has potential.the md forum goers have been calling for a removal of nearly all npc related items in favor of everything player made. this could work."
"i've advocated for this for a long time, actually. less reliance on empire? good. fewer npc-sold goods? even better."
"lot of thought to put into this development, but definitely a route to follow. the only thing to avoid it to transform what now is a isk sink (npc produced pos fuels) in a isk faucet."
"i fully support this subject. i have posted many threads in the back and while ideas may differ here and there planets need to become something important in eve. they are scources of all life and raw minerals more than any moon or outpost.and if you vote for me in the next csm election i'll make sure planets are on the voting agenda for the csm meetings."
"i'm all for it, as long as isk making in ways you speak of, remains just as hard, as it is for miners or mission runners. if it becomes easier for pvpers in the process, this will ultimately screw things up, and make the pvp activity the only activity in the game. one of the reasons why eve is such a good game is because it offers so many things to do for a player. it offers relatively equal rewards and incentive for doing all that, provided you trained the right skills, and you know what you are doing and you know how to do it well. taking that \"balance\" away, will no doubt have negative impact."
"huh. well, at least tell me what sucks about this idea? - too vague/hard to understand what i mean?- you prefer single-player for making isk?- there are already a bunch of great group-oriented ways for making isk that i don't know about, making my idea irrelevant?- you don't want the developers to spend time on this when they could spend it on something else?i know that personally i've had about all i can stand of ratting and mission-running all alone. it's so damn boring, it's not even like a game anymore (although i love pvp). it seems like if there were a cooperative component, making isk could be made into a more complex, game-like activity instead of just a big repetative grind. so consider this an invitation to flame and explain why this idea sucks."
"i didn't see it but might be blind. why not scale the mission waves by the number of people currently at the deadspace. not straight 1 to 1 mind you but maybe 3 people get twice the spawns?edit mining is much more fun with a group where you can bull**** in the fleet channel"
"i support this whole heartedly. it would make it more clear how the player base as individuals view and support the ideas given."
"1 account 1 vote?i agree."
"1 vote per account seems fair."
"i agree!"
"good ideas, by the by. anyone think of any else that the op can edit into their starting post?"

"according to ccp's lead dev these would be niggling little problems that they don't want the csm looking at, and therefore unimportant, but /signed anyway.you can do #4 without the map by the way - if you have bookmarks in the people & places folder you can use set destination to someonewhere you don't already have a waypoint set, and then use set destination again to where you want to go. cumbersome still though. i'd rather have a right click in space option of \"remove current route setting\" or something.as for the market suggestions, maybe a quick fix could be to set it so that it does a data load when the screen is opened, but then have a 'refresh now' button rather than forcing a refresh every time any information is requested (obviously on a sale/purchase a minimal amount of data would need to be checked to make sure the item is still there to sell/buy but that's better than a full data dump every time). result = reduced server load, reduced lag, reduced visibility of non-existant multi-threading... looks like a win all around to me!"

"does anyone who supports this idea have an idea of what this would do to 0.0 battles/jita or any location in space for that matter, with more than x amount of ships? lag bomb ftl. the servers would have to transfer your logo and paintjob anytime you landed on grid with them. i think lag is enough of an issue with this game. wait until technology improves before this should even be an option. the server currently only needs to load the standard skins and its still pretty bad. this is just asking for it. while to the untechnical, this sounds \"a cool idea\", it is not. it would make high traffic spots and fleet battles even slower. ~ dru"

"seeing as issues will now carry over to the next election here goes my post :)cooler weapon effects that don't effect gameplay at all! what do i mean? well it's simple really, you allready see these effects i propose on capital weapons.gattling autocannons have a cool model of a 6 barrel gun ststem. the autocannon it'self fires a shot every 2 seconds. now while my idea doesn't change the dps or for i believe it would make the weapon cooler when fired if graphicaly it fired 6 shots every 2 seconds. note once again completely cosmetic change.another place weapons could look better are ammar quad lasers opr lasers in general. how cool would it be if while pluses stayed the same if true lasers were graphics a solid beam that never lets up? to add to this the laser effect could move around the hull of the targeted ship swaying back and front as it tracks tearing the hull apart!other changes include any weapon that graphical shows 2 cannons or says it's quad for instance. now you take this a step forward and add in shield effects so those 6 shots a second on the minmatar gatling gun make water like ripples when stopped by the shields.and to make it even cooler while your shileds are up the shields should open up a little making holes for each shot you fire. or in ammars case form through the shields pulling a bit with it!and becuase it's kinda under the same idea, capital ships have cool looking wrecks... why not other ships? at least give battleships wrecks that look like the hull of the ship and move down from there.vote mothermoon for csm, the potential canidate"
"not *entirely* sure about this - current csm has another 5 months (or so) to serve, and they have another meeting in iceland in 3 months don't they? :)hang on, this should only be the kind of thing we would get if we were playing a premium quality game with a monthly subscription, award winning graphics, cutting edge programming and design.... oh.... <looks at ccp> .... waits ....."
"i think some of your suggestions are a little too much, however, i think weapon effects should be looked at and always a toggable graphics option for players.but, really truly believe projectile weapons need cool effects. how come there is no visible explosion on a target vessle when firing artillery? just one example."
"yes i know some of my ideas are a little over the top but if taken to ccp any list of upgrades to weapon effects should be listed down by time and resources, meaning yes the whole shield thing is a bit instance, but the idea is to get the smaller easier to program detials in and think towards the future 2-3 years down the line.like explosions for atries, great idea!"
"you're right, battleships and dreadnaughts did become obsolete by the middle of the 20th century and building of these stopped, however building of proper battlecruisers stopped too. also if we're going to compare the navies of eve to the navies of now then cruisers should also fade into the background as they are far less common now than at any time in their history. frigates would remain reasonably common. however we should all be flying around in either carriers or destroyers as they are the 2 most common surface vessels which have comparable versions in eve."
"you know before ccp boosted cap hp's by 300% folks thought that cap ships were nice but to fragile for routine use. actually once upon a time, i'm lead to believe, a deathstar pos could alpha strike a dread out of existence. if ccp wants to deal with cap ship online they need to reexamine the cap hp buff of two years ago.dal"
"wasn't just cap ships that have gotten an hp buff. the hp buff also hurt minmatar on the scale for fleet work and their specialty of \"high alpha\" but when people have so much hp alpha didn't matter as much but this stuff needs looking into."
"it was a 400% increase, and the chance of a deathstar one-shotting a capital back then may be a little bit of a tall tale (if it was a minmatar large with all large artilleries that all got wrecking hits, well, maybe, but i've never run the numbers)."
"not reading the last page where the csm reply is before posting? priceless"
"i have read some of this thread here and found the ideas to be very interesting. perhaps we can vote on having the devs seriously consider them?real space initiativethe different style of jumping from system to system is the most interesting to me."
"supported, of course."
"over all i love the idea, though i can't support it, it would mean an almost complete redesign of eve, at least the major parts of it. the idea is great, i would love to play this game however i think it would need to be eve-online ii."
"supported!also a \"create/remove hangar\" option would be nice (some people need 3 hangars and others 20...). and it would be nice to have that option not only for corp hangars but also for personal hangars. (i just thinking about personal mission running assets where hundreds of items must be collected in one single hangar today. to have the possibility to sort this a bit would be fine.)all this of course only if such an improvement does not contribute to lag, otherwise forget it."
"supported... even one additional one would be nice."
"yes please."
"please. especially since any pos utilization requires the player to put potentially valuable resources in corp hangers."
"definitely need more hangers, my wardrobe is getting very cluttered.hang on, is that not what this is about? ;)"
"would be great."
"hello,in the market under \"implants > skill hardwireing\", the imlants are only divided by slot type.what i'm proposing is the possibility of more divisions. that is, make the current slot divisions into those ones with expanding arrows, and then under each one have the implants divided into type, like tracking enhancing, turret damage etc.an example is this.slot 9 would have- turret damage- booster side effects- mwd cap usageetcsorry if i've made a hash of explaining this, basically make the implant list look like the \"turret and bays\" list with more drop down divisions."

"ccp should bring back the 30 day time cards as a lot of places in australia are not selling the 60 day ones anymore. this is stopping people like myself from playing eve simply because we don't have credit cards or debit cards."
"they need to introduce 120 day gtc as well"
"if only there was a 31 page thread about this already on the board ;)i believe this was raised in iceland by the csm and the response was that the change has been made because their pricing model wasn't working as intended (tm) and they needed the extra cash that this change would generate in order to fund new development.to answer the op though, i personally feel that ccp should be able to provide you with a list of stores near you which still sell the 60 day cards (i am aware that in australia, 'near' can be a relative concept). note that as 60 day cards are now the smallest 'denomination' that more shops will start stocking them again, assuming that the reason they stopped buying them in was because most people wanted the 30 day ones - might be worth a conversation with the store manager of the place you've been buying your 30s to let him know 60s are the future :)"
"perhaps if they didn't all go off to iceland in the first place we wouldn't have an increase, assuming they had expenses paid for them to go of course."

"unfortunately, the ability for people to gather ore is already pretty impressive - a capital ship for mining couldn't be any better than a hulk, otherwise it could potentially do bad things to the mineral market.i would be fine with a mining capital ship like this, however:-similar (no more) ore output than a hulk-large cargobay-ore compression technologyperhaps a bonus to mining laser range would be interesting..."
"we don't need a capital miner so much as we need variety in mining itself. strip miners and the hulk are the end atm. just adding a drone specialist mining ship nearly equivalent or equal to the hulk or some other ideas would be great. it would be like saying no ship will ever be better than a vagabond so every trains only for it and anyone without it is considered beneath it."
"i'd like to see an offline movie-making package for eve, where the would-be movie producer can place stations, celestial bodies, and ships as they please, and then direct those same ships to maneuver, fire, warp, etc at pre-determined times. this would be accompanied by the ability to place static cameras anywhere, with a multitude of additional camera tools, and to record the events as they unfold, so that these set-piece battles can be replayed repeatedly, for the perfect fraps capturing.anyone who has played the il-2 flight simulator knows how easy this is, and how it allows for some incredible movies to be made with a minimal of fuss. if we had these tools, i believe we'd see a lot more high-quality movies, and a game such as eve deserves it."

"as many of you know, you can only train one character per a account. thus leading to a decent amount of players to have multiple accounts.i would be interested in discussion about a way to allow us to train multiple characters on one account, but there really no reason for ccp to allow this due to they would lose profit. i do think there are people with single accounts that boardline wanting to start a second character(or buy a character with isk) and if there was a small charge of '5 usd' per a additional training slow on a account may be profitable for ccp. while being profitable it would also be a benfit to a person like myself, who doesn't really need to be flying two accounts at the same time but does enjoy being able to train and fly for a vary of ships."
"supported. kinda dumb the op has to double post to support."
"this has been debated to death, and i just have to say it: no. it would seriously screw with the balance of the game (imagine training up a freighter pilot to trade, a badass miner and a specialized recon pilot at the same time). if someone wants to do that now they can, but it takes a lot of excess cash or isk, so there's at least a cost. if you want to start a new character, sell your current one (if it has more than 5 mil sp). if it has less than 5 mil sp, you aren't really losing much by starting over."
"agree to disagree. since character sales are supported, you would be able to train the pod pilots along side your main and then sell it off.. it would make the character trade market die completely because everyone would be able to do it."
"i'm not sure what you guys are complaining about. the current system is a lot worse./signed."
"like some already said, none of the boost amount implants work with capital modules. for a good reason, i might add. because with a high-grade set, a shield recharge rate on the passive buffer shield tank would be completely out of balance.not really. the thing is, implants and such giving extra buffer which doesn't regenerate on it's own just gives some extra time for the ship to survive before it is popped. recharging buffer can very easily make the tank stable against much larger amount of dps than the tank could survive without the extra buffer. besides, passive shield tanking is already pretty awesome as it is."
"afs clearly failing in anything because they behave like bricks.ze mob demands nano afs. add low-slots to afs. match mass/agility of afs proportional to hac:t1 ratios.nano-afs would render interceptors useless ? turning the tables: introduce heavy interceptors (vagabond with ceptor resistances) and match hacs mass/agility proportional to current af:t1 ratios.no, just kidding :) nanoing afs will bring more fun."
"i don't really care about the csm one way or another. i'm of the opinion it's just ccp's joke on us players - a distraction of sorts. having said that, every time jade makes a goon cry i like him more and more. goons have stated pretty clearly their goal in eve is to make the game miserable for everyone else. why should anyone on the council, other than the two goonies, care two figs about what they have to say? stfu and go back to ganking miners."
"personally i would prefer any biases to be in the public domain - if jade had not said anything about anti-goon bias but had instead kept it secret and sabotaged goonswarm's <sarcasm> no doubt noble and glorious </sarcasm> grand plans with his awesome power to call a vote in csm meetings (a power so awesome that my knees are trembling. really.)... would that be any better?i have way more respect for people in the public eye who acknowledge their personal bias than those who try to hide it."
"the direction this thread is turning isn't a surprise. as long as goons keep coming from a place of \"us against the world\", you might not be surprised if the world treats goons as such.csm, i'm glad you had a productive meeting. keep up the good work."
"well i know i for one am getting impatient for the notes. now i'm told ccp will have to go through the iceland face to face minutes first... may i please remind you all that ccp has yet to publish meetings 1-5 still? my guestimation is that we might see something at the end of the csm term... if there is any ccp actually reading this , please , if the meeting was such a fantastic success, why are the notes and list of yes/no/not possible - still unavailable. this continuation of not knowing means issues that have answers are still being kicked around in assembly needlessly. would it not be more productive to section out the done items? i mean really... the \"in development\" page is from october of last year. 9 months old... okay rant off :(edit - i have been corrected 2 of the meeting notes have been published (not in proclaimation where they were to be)"
"our csm secretary has had rl intrude quite brutally this week and the minutes from our side are going to be delayed a couple of days. please be patient this stuff will get done. in the mean time there is a mostly good shc thread covering some general issues and outcomes hereand i've been going through some of the specific threads on assembly hall and giving the results as i come across them. i know its frustrating to wait, but please try to be understanding. if you do want to know what happened about anything item specifically just ask and i'll check my own notes and try to give you an answer. okay?"
"but were the fish yummy"
"thanks for the link jade, google search only goes so far :)"
"to be fair, it is a bit tough to get past the minutiae or \"niggling\" as he puts it when it has been a thorn in the players side for so long. i would wager if we can get a lot of these \"niggling\" issues out of the way you would see quite a bit of grander ideas. can't see the forest from the tress, kind of issue.but ccp has to understand that the first blast for the player base will be the things that we a) have been promised to have been fixed b) do not understand why it can not be fixed because of the lack of communication. (if there is a lack of communication you have a lack of understanding. if we do not understand, how are we to focus on \"the grander ideas\"?)if ccp would just open up communications a little better, their customers would probably be willing to work on topics on a larger scale.but overall i am glad to see this happen. it seemed to be a good initial run. i think now the csm has to look at the suggestions in a different light now. if they viewed our concerns as \"niggling\" then we have to start being creative."
"agreed, it's hard to look in building up your mansion even higher, grander... when the garden still has yet to be tended. or the driveway needs repaved, etc...polish and clean the house first, before we start making plans on room additions."
"this to be honest, in fact going even further try to build up on poor/buggy foundations and the whole thing could collapse. every new expansion introduces more bug and imbalances and these things ccp promise to fix then they sweep them under the carpet with the next \"insert big idea here\" expansion and we never see them fixed. building new content over bugs only creates new buggy content. and there is only so much buggy content one can take. we can go and beta test for free if we want bugs why would we pay for the priviledge?it seems to me that the real issues and conserns are just \"niggly\" issues to ccp. but i suppose their record of issue handling/bug fixes already told us that."
"back in the day when i did martial arts, my instructor used to tell me that the better i wanted to be, the more perfect i needed to be with the basics. he used the analogy of a pyramid - the higher you want to build the pinnacle, the wider the base has to be. sure, you could have a narrow base, but if you want the thing to stand for five thousand years and more, the fatter and sturdier it needs to be.similar thing to this really - before you want to start reaching higher (i.e. lurching from one 'big thing' to the 'next big thing') you need to make sure that the basic code and indeed game mechanics can support what you're trying to do."
"been doing metaphors and fables and hints for the past few years, nothing gets through to them. not even the frothing at the mouth i've done above. you guys feel free to continue to ever so gently try, shrug.this is ccp."
"why should they listen? after all, the whole tone of that interview was that according to noah, we all know jack about game design - he is the man, the uber authority on the subject, and it's his responsibility to smack down all those upstart youngsters who come bouncing in with enthusiasm and fresh ideas.i am paraphrasing here - but to be honest, that's the impression the interview gave, and why i called him a pompous ass in my earlier post :)personally, i would think it would be better business practise to figure out how to put those fresh ideas into a game without stripping them of their sparkle and shine, otherwise it will just go stale. but i don't earn big bucks as a lead designer, so ... <kow-tows to the man> ... i am not worthy."
"reading a pdf instead of a \"book\"? lol. thats a new one. no thanks.if they had the \"book\" for the kindle, then i would totally buy it.eve-tv needs to be purchasable through amazon's unbox and apple's itunes for like $1.99 / episode. i spend more on coffee in the morning. (or the subway).-jg."
"right, but then it can be stolen and thus why ccp didn't do it.which is silly because it's unavoidable now a days. even gamnes and such.howver my point is even less people will pay for it if it's pay per view becuase no one wants to pay for something and not even own it.so by working with i-tunes and maybe making eve tv twice a month instead of every week, players like you and me will give ccp money.however i believe a low erz shorter free version would be needed to .but it's to late for this csm... so for the next one!"
"i dont know if i believe \"rampant digital theft\" is the reason why eve-tv was closed down. i bet there was more to it than we know. maybe they were operating the show at a loss. maybe they lost their \"actors\" to fee renegotiation \"churn\". maybe the production team couldnt control costs effectively. maybe they didnt get the necessary number of viewers they needed.people will pay for stuff if there is value. radiohead kinda proved that point recently, yah? otherwise itunes and amazon's unbox (and their kindle device) wouldnt be selling so well. we wouldnt have had the writers strike - or be threatened by the actors strike. im not trying to litigate a case here, there is rampant theft, but there is also commerce. and a lot of it.as for eve-tv's perceived \"value\", id pay $1.99 / episode - thats about it.-jg."

"very important change!"
"supported."
"i would agree.. but only if the corps in the same alliance can not sign up on opposite sides.how disfunctional would that be.. hey in 0.0 we are best buds defending our space. but in the militia we are killing each other!!either alliance as a whole picks a side and then the corps can join or not join that side.or the first corp to join one side locks all other corps in that alliance to that side. (which i dont like as much because it could cause alliances to break up) but hey maybe thats what we need.at least if its an alliance decision. then the corps in the alliance can vote.. and if they dont like where things are heading they can leave knowing in advance what the alliance is doing."
"i want to get back into my corp tbh. having to create an extra corp for the alliancea.) added an extra administrative layer noone neededb.) splits the alliance, which sucks"
"first of all, how can you not see how much fun that would be?secondly, what if you've taken the time to reach standing 10 with caldari and amarr on your only character, but your alliance does a vote on which faction to join and it comes up minmatar. what are your options?1) grind minmatar standings and destroy the standings you worked to build with caldari and amarr2) make an alpha-clone character on your account and fly around in a no-skills frigate (and wish you were playing as your main the whole time)3) buy a second account just for fw.i mean clearly ccp should just start forcing people to buy a second account when they subscribe at this point, because so many things require it. seriously though i don't want to have to pay 2b to buy a decent character for fw; i just want to play my damn counter-strike in space already."

"he may be an amarrian, but damnit he's got it dead to rights on this issue."
"/supported.i've been wanting to see this for a long time. freighters are expensive, slow, unable to tank or defend themselves, carry way too much for what most players want, require big protection and generally, they are just a corp tool rather than a player tool. for the marketing industrial player, they are more trouble that they are worth.something smaller and can be fitted with a minor degree of protection, (even if it's only 2 or 3 midslots for a shield tank), is needed to bridge the gap. 100-200k cargo (carries 1 gfc with a small amount spare) and more agile than a freighter. the primary resource in eve is ore so it should never be limited to not being able to carry it. i'm tired of moving large amounts of trit after a spell of mining to sell at a better price but needing 5 or more trips each time. an expanded itty with rigs carries 35k, that's only 3.5 million tritanium, a pitiful amount compared to what a single person can mine in a session. however, a freighter is overkill.even if a small freighter was 200 million isk or so, it would be worth it."
"saying is not proof you have to actually show it. if its impossible to prove its kinda of a mute argument then. but it semi proves the other point that others have been banned for posting real life info. in your opinion it may be hypocritical to only ban some of those that post real life info, but im fairly sure ccp reserves the right to treat each case individually and look at the circumstances surrounding it. just because he might have pseudo-celebrity because of the incidents that led to his ban doesn't give him any right to be exempt from the rules. im fairly sure there are others that have been banned for posting real life info, should their ban be also lifted? change the rule for one you have to change the rule for all."

"one problem with that is that it keeps the racial spaceship command skills at one more than amarr and caldari."
"that's mainly because angels and serpentis both use gallente/minmatar as combination, not because my offered combinations don't exist. a even distribution would have all empires to be used three times but with the angel/serpentis double you'll end up with a gallente/minmatar bias...."
"other corps that have implants like the pirate corps in the history and game:* nomad: bonus to agility. faction: thukkerproblem: minmatar and they already have one more than caldari/amarr.* harvest: bonus to mining laser range. faction: oreproblem: they have ships already see mining barges.* virtue: bonus to scan probe strength. faction: sisters of eveproblem: humanitarian organization most likely not making awesome ships.* edge: reduction in booster side effects. faction: syndicate problem: another gellente group.mordu's legion commandthe origin of mordu's legion lies in the gallente-caldari war when a group intaki military personnel sided with the caldari.problem: is its gellente + caldari.their implants from rev 3:* centurion: bonus to optimal range of ecm, rsd, tracking disruptor and target painters. faction: mordusrogue drones:some factions mix and mash them together into a set of three ships.problem: most likely gellente + ________ and as seen gellente already have one more than caldari/amarr.possible fix that would make the bias equal. it would be like the amarrian sansha.royal khanid navy:the royal khanid navy consists of ships designed by the dark amarrians themselves, with a bit of help from the caldari, which the kingdom has always held good relations with.possible solution: it is amarr + caldari and with faction warfare going on it might make enough since to have a group of ships. only thing they would need would be a quick set of low grade implants. and it would fit the roles of having implants and having faction ships that use two different spaceship command skills."
"i like anything that puts more hulls in the game. but to be honest. i don't want a general all purpose ship. there are lots of those already in the game, and most of the current faction implementations are just larger stronger more pew pew versions of well rounded ships that are already in game. i like limited usability in ships, stuff thats very good at one thing, and maybe not worthless in another, but at least highly crippled outside of its area of influence.so personally.. i think we should be moving toward a more focused look at ship role design with not just faction ships, but all ships. which ccp seems to be doing anyway. so i'll support this, not because i think there is any real imbalance on faction ships, they are simply there. but more because i think something interesting could come of it if someone can think up a way to implement them for pew pew that, either doesn't already exist, or is currently setup in some anemic way which with a little love could make it a truly viable playstyle."

"well, the devs wanted regions to be only partially (or, rather said, sub-optimally) self-sufficient, in order to encourage trade of various items and/or materials between them.but when they turned around and nerfed mineral compression and carrier hauling, the whole idea became kind of questionable..."
"yes i am quoting myself :p. this is where i would limit it myself. i think minerals being available locally for basic t1 manufacturing should be in every region. it is why i want drone mins revamped to allow for more resonable quantities. drone region logisitcs are terrible in large part because of drone minerals favoring high ends so heavily. i know i am repeating myself. sorry."
"i can't be bothered with the rest of this argument, but to be honest the argument about the high price of tritanium bores me. if tritanium price is high, it means that tritanium supply is low, and tritanium demand is high. thusly, at some point some bright spark will be motivated to get into his mining vessel and mine veldspar. mining veldspar at this point can be seen as inherently profitable due to high availability, low supply and high demand.i give the tritanium price issue over not to a problem with the market but to either a lack of capable miners or laziness. markets are inherently self-correcting because profitable niches are quickly filled by intelligent individuals seeking more money. the tritanium \"crisis\" will sort itself out because people in eve want to make money. to be honest, on the scale of ease-of-extraction-to-profit ratio mexallon probably ranks highest, as plagioclase is plentiful, found in a large number of hi-sec regions and provides a goodly supply of mexallon. my fortune when i was a miner wasn't made off of veldspar or bistot - it was plagioclase.smart industrialists will always fill a niche in a market because smart industrialists both want and know how to make money."
"1. don't put more then 2-3 hundred mill on your ship.2. use alt scout. which would be tiresome after awhile.3. use cloak which kills scan resolution.5. forget any lowslots and fill them with istabs+nanos.6. ???what other counters are there exactly? the only real feasible option is number 1."
"no insurence for highsec ganker sounds right"
"option 2 being the most obvious, its not that it gets tiresome, its that you don't want to interrupt your isk flow by spending time ensuring your safety, failing that go ask the low sec mission runners who've been living with ganks long before ppl came crying to the forums.also l4 missions dont require a pimp fit to complete, so your low cost option is also fine.scan res isnt that big a deal in pve tbh, at least it shouldn't be, in some cases a cloak wont save you anyway.its easily done and i'm not going to tell you how, as i've said before it is a \"multi\" player game, you don't have to be in the same corp to work together."

"it's not the learning skill training time that is the problem, it's the stupid advice given to new players that they have to train them all right away.you can train the skills you need as well as the learning skills on a rotating basis, thus keeping you in new toys and gaining faster training time without outright sacrificing either one for the other."
"i like the idea to remove them. its ugly for new players to spend time to learn learnings. but the new way, need to be balance well. as old player it does not hurts me to lose the time i spend in them. i got my bonus for them. and without them new players can consentrate on the funny things, like new ships and weapons. in fakt of this eve becomes a lote more nooby friendly. and we all profit from more eve player.maybe ccp can put a explore the universe thing in the game. for example the newbie becomes the mission to fly to ruins in a system. or the the mission to fly 10 jumps into .0 space (with a guide in the front of course). and from the expirience the car will get in this mission, the pilot will get a short boost on one of the attributes. for example +2 to willpower."
"but remember that learning skills take patience and eventually eve has to a lot to do with patience. learning skills also scare away those \"fps morons\". yes, we might get more active players...but their quality...?learning skills don't just speed up learning, but you also learn while studying your current skills. getting a new skill everyday would make you skill hungry, not talent hungry. i've done tons of research on items/tactics etc. while waiting for learning skills to finish."
"i dont think, that learnings change the quality of new players. and i never hear that they make some one skill hungry.and at last i forget to hit the support button :d"
"this is a very very bad idea. first off eve is about players all playing the game together. but at the same time no players are = and the same. the learning skills like all skills are a huge part of that system.#1. we all had to go through learning the learning skills as a noob. its part of being a noob.#2. you dont even have to learn the learning skills if you dont want to its a choice. some people only learn there learning skills (the 1st set to level 4 and stop). then they learn the second set to level 4 and stop). these people then pick other skills they want and or need. and in the mean time lose out on skill points for all other skills in order to get what they want now.#3. as a person with all learning skills at level 5 both sets. i sacrificed the ability to do alot of skills in the beginning of the game. but now im learning way faster then many others esp with implants. thats becasue i made the choice!! to sacrifice then to gain now. some of the friends that i started playing with all of us from day one started at the same time i now have well over them in skill points some of them as much as 5 million sp's why because i decided no i will wait to fly that battleship or t2 ship a few more weeks. now im making up for it and bypassing others of my chars age. because of the choice i made. to me thats an advantage i worked for buy planning ahead.eve has never been about people being = its been about everyone being different. and one way i might be different from others is i wanted to learn all the learning skills to max while others did not.thats eve .. its about choices and about being different!"
"indeed - but the one to be viewed only once is the one already written :)i have one - a 23 mil sp mining/manufacture one. i've only recently started missioning with her though and while i get her skills high enough to fly her kezzie well enough to avoid being popped on the kill missions, i am still ploughing through level 1 mining missions. which suck. there seem to be only half a dozen missions when she actually has to mine stuff (which she is breezing through but since she is flying a hulk to them that isn't really surprising), but the majority of the missions she is running are courier with a smattering of kill missions. i mean, wtf is that about? comes back to my point about appropriate missions for agents - i'm talking to a mining agent, give me more bl**dy mining missions! if i wanted to run courier i'd do distribution agents!edit - regarding the linkage above to the mission editor thread, i think that would be a great adddition if some of the issues raised in that thread were addressed. i am an avid player of the thief games, and some of the best missions i've played are ones submitted using the level designer. and if ccp are hiring people to playtest the submitted missions for balance, i will happily send them my resume :p"
"i'm actually for a massive drop in t1 loot from missions, even if it means i make a little less isk. simply because i'm of the mindset that industrialists get ****** over."
"i disagree on some of the details, but overall these are good ideas. i like my t1 loot, but i'm willing to part with it if it's done right(i.e., don't just take it off and call it even, that stuff is a good 20% of mission rewards at times). and the rest just seem like either common sense(npc distribution changes) or nifty ideas(a need for pvp modules in pve)."
"support. i'm very interested in seeing isk-making activities become more challenging and fun. i especially like the idea about missions needing a tackling role to be filled, because it encourages group missioning.also, another related topic."
"fewer & better npc's + no t1 loot. thanks"
"yes, especially regarding the removal of unnamed t1 loot and the more dynamic npc spawns."
"signed.and maybe add a more advanced ai and targeting behavior to all rats."
"i like everything apart \"mission leaders that abandon the mission area unless scrambled\" because it will generate much trouble for players flying slow ships (bs) without an ab in lvl 4s. if you plan to remove that part i will aprove"
"good ideas,i like the idea that some \"leader\" would order some of his forces to \"cover his retreat\" if his forces are getting creamed... what could also be included is (as with some missions now) that after a given (perhaps random) amount of time, that leader returns with an \"overwhelming force\" as related to the ship (or ships) that chased them off in the first place.while i like the idea of more dynamic missions (variable spawns), various different ships of similar types (groups of weak ships, or smaller gangs of tougher ships) i worry that balance may be thrown off if the right combination of factors come together."
"i like"
"explosion velocity:precision light 3000m/s precision heavy 1000m/s <- ccp, you got a typo here, it must be 2000 precision cruise 1000m/s"
"all precision missiles need a buff, especially heavies."
"this is absolutely true. t2 missiles should equal, if not exceed, t1 versions. especially in velocity and duration. lag issue: the explosion radius thing consumes far too many cpu cycles and i wish that you just had a look up table instead of a floating point calculation involving trig functions.... for every explosion! if you want to balance the game we understand, but not at the expense of magnifying lag! complex math should be calculated rarely, maybe one calculation every few seconds could set a scaling factor? the present algorithm wastes server side resources!now truely, even if you do not find a way to save the many milliseconds each explosion takes to calculate, the t2 missiles all fall short of expectations. for any purpose, all of the t2 designs are flawed. regardless of skills, ship bonuses or implant bonuses, a t2 missile should always fly farther and hit harder than a t1!at the very least, the op's general idea is correct (and very well presented too) and i feel is very conservative! his suggest is just the beginning of an effective game balance (oh and i am not much of a missile fighter, i feel the same way about t2 hybrid ammos, they are unfairly nerfed!)thank you. edited to add my vote to this idea."
"agreed. precision heavies are just utterly horrible."
"matter solved then.it's relieving to see the people were not deceived in any way. i submit myself to the majority then...perhaps the destructable outposts is not so bad idea after all and the way ccp thinks of it is a milder compromise. if it was implemented and if supposingly an alliance would raid an outpost and strip it from it's services what kind of isk would be needed so that the outpost be restored to it's former state?"
"i do not support this idea. though jade may have acted hastily in the events in question, this does not mean he should be removed from his post for it.was it rude? yes, but not unreasonable.jade was elected like everyone else and should, and undoubtedly will, continue leading the csm until the end of his term.simply put, if you don't like jade when the time comes and jade decides to run again, don't re-elect him."

"agreed"
"you also agree to loosing faction with the opposing side for each kill then, right?"
"this already happens. so no loss inplementing this change"
"definitely agree that the importance of planets in each system is greatly below where it should be, and that they should be far more significant than just acting as a warpable celestial object as they are currently. allowing inhabited worlds to be developed in order to generate pos components, strontium, jump drive fuel and other necessary consumables for the sovereign alliance would allow for interesting developments, and this could additionally provide a target for small gang logistics disruption. for example npc hauler spawns could automatically deliver fuel to control towers but be vulnerable to hostiles intercepting and popping them, or planetary industrial centres could be hacked or targeted to shut them down for a given period. such a move could see the development of whole new specialisations. for example, an alliance could grant players the planetary governor role (which would require a new set of administrative skills to be trained, something which could boost the value of the currently neglected charisma statline) and give them control over a particular planet to go and sim-city it up, managing its output and needs to produce goods as the alliance required. this would reduce the need for npc sell orders and the market distortions they sometimes create, as well as allowing space-holding player alliances to loosen if not cut the umbilical cord of npc empire dependency and function more like sovereign powers in their own right.it would be great if we saw the introduction of spaceports on the planetary surface which functioned as cheap mini-outposts (with fewer station services and perhaps limited hangar space) to make neglected areas of space habitable without having to plonk down 30b or so for an outpost - and who wouldn't want to build their very own mos eisley, perhaps complete with cantina band? ultimately though, inhabited planets should also be the key to system sovereignty. look at the recent background writing on the capture of new caldari. we didn't get fiction about stront timing or station ping-pong. the caldari showed up around the planet with a load of dropships and deployed troops to the planetary surface to capture it, and frankly that's a far cooler method of taking a system than playing 'who can anchor the most giant space needles'."
"support!"
"would be very useful.and if it isn't possible as some have pointed out (lavista vista being one), then how about giving us the ability to divide our personal hangers up like corp ones."
"/signand i want that if i search after a time, they are alsow showd if they in a container"

"/signed.i am so sick of having to leave items out in the open so i can contract remotely. a fix might even increase server performance as it would discourage leaving everything out in the hangar."
"supported."
"i like this idea. and support it. i'd like to see group missions force different types combat setups for the group, though. there shouldn't be a defacto mission running ship. instead, you'll need a well balanced group of ships to complete it. tacklers, heavy dps, support, blah blah blah. set it up to where missions work like small gang pvp. implement a gang cap, so people just can't bring 200 ships to play.. but instead streamline it for a minimum and a maximum amount of players allowed. minimum means.. that if a gang only wants to have 3 members, the mission is possible, but they better have each one of those members performing a certain specific role to do it. maximum should be self explanatory.. the mission is allowed x number of players. if the game detects anyone not inside you're gang doing anything other than sitting there, including; getting targeted, or targeting.. all the npcs turn tale, warp out, and despawn. mission is auto-magicaly a fail.all that can be balanced, reworked, rethought, whatever. but i want strategical and tactical group missions... not just bring larger numbers. and i want them to be a viable way of making isk."
"i like the principle of this, but the devil's in the details. - do you create a whole new batch of agents to deal with this, or do you overlay it onto the current system? i prefer the former(gives you an excuse to spread the lag without nerfing santenpaa), but if you go for the latter, how will you deal with the screams from solo missioners? - what level does this kick in at? do you start it low, to let newbs in, but risk people running \"gang\" l1s instead of \"solo\" l2s? or do you do something crazy like modify l5 and/or add l6? - do you just make the new gang missions the same but bigger, or do you do new things? do these new things include mechanisms of forcing players to gang up to complete the mission?- loot splitting. 'nuff said. and that's just a sampler of the issues you'll face with this. it's complex and touchy, and if you do it wrong you'll **** off half the subscriber base. i know ccp said they wanted more big-picture stuff, and none of these issues are disqualifying, but they're all things to be very careful about."
"yep"
"group mission-running is only one aspect of what i had in mind. here are some of my ideas for that aspect:when you interact with an agent, you have two options: \"i'm looking for work\", and \"my friends and i are looking for work.\" if you choose the second option, you get a mission that requires a level of player cooperation and interdependency that simply cannot be achieved by one guy running multiple accounts. the mission needs tackling, and ewar, and remote repping, and sniping, and so on, all done at the same time and with some real player skill, in order to win. and in return, the players get rewards that beat what they could earn if they were running classic level fours all alone. enough to make it worth their while to go to the extra trouble of putting together a group and doing something more complex than \"activate tank, f1-f8\".players would be able to take part in these group missions from day one. just like with classic single-player missions, they would scale in difficulty and in rewards by level. the low-level missions train newer players in how to cooperate as a group by gradually introducing the players to different group roles and tactics. those same skills that are introduced in group mission ultimately help prepare the players for group pvp, if they choose to play that side of the game.no artificial mechanics would be needed to prevent \"soloing\" or \"zerging\" the group missions. they can't be soloed because there's too much going on at once. and sure, you can zerg them with twice as many people as the mission requires, but then everyone gets half the profit they would otherwise enjoy. elite groups of friends who run missions together should feel encouraged to hone their teamwork and personal skills to tackle missions as quickly and efficiently as possible without bringing more people along than the mission requires.eve is not a game that lends itself to cooperating with strangers. i think most everyone knows to only join a gang with friends and corp-mates. so, if there's loot to split, i would expect a group of friends to be able to come to a fair agreement on how to split it without the game doing it for them. some missions might even require a salvager/hauler role to be filled to get the loot out \"before it's too late\".i think there's a lot of potential for fun, drama, and heroism there. and, again, i don't mean for group ventures to be limited to only missions. what about:group mining endeavors: an incredibly rich belt of ore is found, but pirates have learned of its location as well. can you and your friends mine out the belt and haul away the ore before the pirates arrive with overwhelming forces, all the while defending yourselves from their advance guard?group exploration complexes: kind of like what we have now, only more complicated, fun and difficult (like the missions i describe above) so as to require an actual group of players instead of just some guy running a second account with a logistics ship. scale up the rewards to match the difficulty so that it beats out mindless solo ratting.group ratting: at *every* planet, there's a pirate installation of some kind. the installations are defended by high-bounty ships, and haulers fly in and out with ore mined from the surrounding belts and other valuables. very lucrative to lay siege these strongholds, but if you try to go it alone you're asking for a quick death. the installations might be equipped with a wide variety of defensive measures so as to require groups of player to work together to overcome them."
"let's explain some counter reasons why only some pve things are done in group:group missions/ratting: you can divide the bounties decently (equal division, independently from the real contribution, but it is acceptable), but you can't divide the loot and you have no chance of checking what the other people has looted. \"damn, that faction bs had only a tag and standard modules.\" true or false?\"we have got a officer xy module, i will sell it and divide the gain\". player divide 500 millions. true sell price? \"we have found only some ton of regular modules, i will pay them buy market price\" ouch, i get more reprocessing them. in a game like eve faith in other people honesty can get you only to a point. thenthere is the problem or really evalutating what the drops are worth.if player a want to sell for fast cash and player b want to put it on market at a high price, as it will sell in a month, who will decide? exploration:\"great, i have spent half day to find this site, and get 1/5 of the reward like the others\"any kind of activity:\"yes, i would love to do xy, but i can start only at 20.30\"; \"at 21.00 i am leaving with mygirl, so we shuold complete for 20.50.\" ecc.mining is one of the best group operations because it get a increased result for group effort (more security and more yield), it is easy to divide the profits, a single player can enter/leave when needed without doing much damage to the others. all things not shared by other group efforts. your vision is beautiful but would require:- a lot more thrust between players (in eve );- way better npc ai;- a serious commitment for ccp in developing pve.i don't see any of the above as probable. with all the above, any step in this direction can be good, so let support your idea."
"actually i was thinking of it more like this:*logs on*o/anyone wanna run an exploration encounter?yessome of us already are, you wanna join mid-way?sureokaylove tookay, i'll just find a new one for us. gimme a bit...[10 minutes passes]okay guys, i found a couple of options. do you like [a] or [b]?[people decide which encounter to run][everyone travels 2-3 systems to the encounter][everyone runs the encounter in 1-2 hours][everyone makes more isk than they would if they'd just been ratting]as for the trust issue, i have in-game friends that i trust, and i trust my corp-mates and alliance-mates. we split loot all the time when we do roaming pvp gangs; this shouldn't be any harder."
"sorry, but:- finding a exploration site is more like 2 hours,- i have complete thrust in my corpmate in my 5 mens corp (they are all directors and i routinely research my bpo in the corp pos without locking them), hard to say the same in a 150 man corp, especially if it is regularly recruiting ."
"hence my vision to change the game to make them easier and quicker to find, in addition to more profitable and entertaining to complete..."
"wouldn't it be ironic if we used all our characters to vote for this."
"good to see two representatives are supporting this also!!!agree totally take care,arithron"
"actually, and contrary to possible appearances, but it *is* 'one account one vote' currently.during the csm-ccp meeting i had an issue up about this problem - that we (as csm) cannot tell whether or not the 5% (at that time) vote had been reached as it was an 'account' measure not a 'pilot' one and we were advised that should the numbers replying to / supporting an issue where no csm member has picked it up then it only takes a moment for ccp to give us the number of accounts represented as opposed to avatars.this means that (a) making people decide which is their 'main' character on a given account doesn't need to have an admin process worked out, and (b) that the issues can't be stacked, as you worry about.iz"
"it's good to hear that ccp/csm is on top of this issue. however, at the moment, as has been shown by people in this post, the level of support being shown against a given issue is being skewed by people voting with multiple alts. and unlike ccp/csm it's those figures that we see and use to gauge how popular a given issue actually is.however, the idea of only allowing \"main\" characters to post in here would help to reduce the noise in the forum thus allowing greater focus to be placed against important issues as opposed to issues constantly bumped to the front page by people using multiple alts to give the appearance that an issue is more pressing than it actually is.please note, however, that this isn't directed at anyone in particular, more of a \"what if?\" potential situation."

"i have a g15 keyboard owned scrubs"
"g15 ftw, but yeah for those who cant afford one, supported."
"i think that topics covered by the csm still being in the assembly hall may detract from other topics not yet discussed. some people may not know they have been covered ad read / vote for them while they could be contributing to other issues.should we move them to a separate forum? label them?"
"yes, on both counts though i'm unsure of what impact it would have given that even with a multi page thread on an issue that tends to stay near the front page (skill queues) we still have multiple people starting their own threads on the same issue.while moving the issues dealt with to a seperate forum in order to increase clarity would be welcome it does lead to the issue that someone will look at this forum, not see the thread due to it having been moved and just start another one."
"ccp said they wanted more grand ideas to come out of csm.. well.. here is my grand idea.i want pirate factions to have a larger impact on eve. i do not like that currently, their largest reason for being is to dump huge amounts of isk into the game, and really nothing else. this idea is a tie-in to factional warfare, but it doesn't have to be.the four empires are currently fighting back and forth over low-sec. this means a lot of flux, my idea, in its simplest form is for pirate factions to try and capitalize on the current state of chaos. they do this by randomly, a few times a month, invading a system in lowsec.this means the pirates lock-down a system. gate camps, station camps, roving parties, reserve fleets... the works. players then need to kick them out. this should be a massive undertaking that takes a day or two for factions to complete. it comes with its own special missions, storyline missions, maybe even a few cosmos-like missions(can only be done once per event, but can be done again at the next event); all of which can only take place during an insurrection.basic working would be an overlay to the current fw system. the server decides that its bored, and its time cause problems for everyone. it then picks a system in lowsec, preferably several, one in each region of lowsec. it then flips control of that system to no-one controlling it, its owned by the pirates. after that, its a race, all factions get a point total for missions completed against the pirates. whomever can get to the arbitrary \"magic number\" of points needed first, is able to start the normal system of taking ownership of the system. caviet is, there is also a timer, for every hour after you hit the magic number, if you haven't yet taken control of the system, points are deducted.. maybe putting you under the number needed to try for the capture. of course, the other factions could also hit the point total, and start trying for the capture at the same time. after ownership of the system is claimed, pirates stop spawning, and mopup work begins.ideally, what you'd get is a bit of controlled insanity. you'd have large groups of npcs, fighting large groups of pcs, both of whom are then ambushed by another group of pcs. along with all the back and forth that it brings. it really wouldn't be who brought the most ships, because a small group of 5-6 people in the right ships.. while they couldn't normally hurt a group of 20-30... in this type of gameplay could really cause them some pain. as they aren't there to win the engagement. but instead to simply make sure the other side doesn't win. and, hopefully make sure that the pirates take out as many of the other side's ships as possible at the same time.additionally, because the pirates keep spawning at some timed interval(say, top of the hour every hour). one empire really can't lock-down the system without a huge number of ships. if each lowsec region gets its own event at the same time, it should spread it out enough on the cluster that no one faction should be able to bring enough ships to any one event, to allow that sort of one sided victory, without giving up several other systems in the process. so, we should get some rather interesting fights out of the ordeal.above is the idea in a nutshell. now, there is one idea which does not go into that system, but that i've wanted for awhile now in reguards to pirates... (running out of characters for this post)."
"pirate class ships:empires don't get them, they are completely 100% pirate only. they also require skillbooks you can only get from pirate factions. example.. after awhile the pirate factions have decided that they don't work under the same set of battle conditions that most fleets do, so they've came up with the privateer class ship. its a frigate/destroyer/cruiser/whatever which is uniquely suited to the idea of small gang pvp(or whatever). you need the privateer skill to fly it, plus whatever two empire starship skills would normally be required for a ship of its hull class.i have no idea if any of this is technically workable, i have no idea if its even a \"good idea\". but it is one direction i'd like to see eve heading in."
"i support the idea of giving the pirate factions a greater role. i know a lot of people talk about the jove, but personally, i'd be far more interested in seeing ccp develop the non-empire factions further.i'm not so sure about the insurrection idea, i'd rather see the pirates taking on a proper, joinable fw role. the pirate ship classes would be a good move, though."
"my topic on pirate faction ships might be something adding a new racial skill for ships isn't very likely right now but the fact that the ships get bonus's from both racial skills is a fun gimmick. that and the fact it is would more likely be easier to hack and slash two techs together than creating a entire new tech and probable easier for balancing."
"pirate only faction ships are really just something i think is neat, and i didn't feel like writing a second thread for it, so i just rolled it into this one. the first part of the post is really the meat and potatoes of my idea. and truly, i don't even know if its a good idea. i just want discussion about making the pirate factions more inclusive to gameplay. i find the current implementation of them as boring and half baked for a game of eve's complexity. it just seems than we can do better than using them as kill quests in the same manner that every other mmo on the market uses its npc factions. maybe not make them game defining points in the game, but at least allow them to make the game more interesting and give it some flavor in how you interact with them."
"i wrote a thread check it out."
"large railguns are dual barreled on their icon, however when i see them on the rokh they are single barreled. they need to redo the turrets and the way they move, on a naval gun the whole containing assembly doesn't move, just the barrel. although i am giving support to this item i believe that ccp should work on the gaimplay issues and on game balancing more than graphics. a great game will make up for ok graphics but great graphics will not make up for an ok game."
"hey as an artist working an internship at a small time game company i have to chime in. we love to have stuff to work on while the programmers work their magic. even if it doesn't make it in we're still making stuff all day.and contrary to the belief we all know a bit of programing to get by."
"i'm in favour of this. however, just like someone above mentioned, this should be more of a side project that can be rolled out slowly over time while focusing more on the bigger, gameplay affecting issues."
"i completely agree, i'm sure the client can handle extra bits n' bobs.which is a really good point. ccp have stated before they work in cells and that artists mainly do arty stuff.it seems that ccp do have quite a bit on their plates these days in the old visual department, they have ambulation assets to create as well as the rest of the eve universe which were left out last time, such as npc deadspace structures, pos, planets/moons, asteroids ect. there are also rumours of the good old ui overhaul.hopefully next year we can see cool gunnery/shield effects :d"
"has anyone actually thought this out? at a certain point, you can't make the changes anyone is proposing. why? because there are going to be a lot of players who simply play the game, don't get involved on forums, and while may dislike the current playstyle.. are going to complain as soon as their capital isn't nearly as useful as it was before. you can nerf capitals, you can boost other classes against capitals.. but the end result either way is going to be a very angry playerbase who hadn't been vocal before, and suddenly are now. because i guarantee you, that as much as we all hate pos warfare now, if hundreds of dread pilots all the sudden find that their main reason for having dumped several million sp into dread just up and dries up.. they are going to be less than happy.. even if they hated what they did.the only true answer, isn't a broad sweeping set of changes, or one massive change.. but instead, a well thought out slow progression of changes over a year or two...something like, but not exactly like.. this:(i'm sorry if this looks machiavellian, but this is simply an example idea of the timeframe, not a true fix.)step one:remove pos warfare, rebuild and balance all the dreads in the game for a new role... which is going to upset a whole lot of people.. so to sugar coat it.. intentionally over-power dreads at the time of the change.. people will still complain.. but they'll complain less if all the sudden they become awesome.step two:six months down the line on the next large patch, bring dreads back in line with real balance figures for their new role.step three:next large patch, introduce some specialty mechanics/modules/ships that are purely setup for some sort of anti capital warfare. under balance them, not so much they can't do their job, but enough so people get used to them.step four:and the large patch after that..rebalance the mechanics/modules/ships. so now hopefully everything is fixed.."
"supported, i don't know why people are not supporting the discussion of capital ships really while discussing them with great vehemence."
"id like maybe to see capital ships have sub-systems like outposts have. a bunch of battleships disabling a titans doomsday by targeting one of its sub-systems (high slot sub-system for example, disabling a motherships drone bay/cargo bay destroying any drones/fighters/equipment inside and stopping it deploying any more (maybe even a sub-system that allows it to control its fighters and drones)).disabling a titans/jump freighters (yes i count freighters as capital ships) jump drive sub-system to stop them from travelling. destroying a dreadnaughts high-slot sub-system disabling its ability to siege.these sub-systems can be repaired but maybe only with nanite paste/in stations and not by remote repping (since the sub-systems are more complicated than structure/armour)."
"because the proposal of the op is an open ended discussion without limit as to what would be discussed. in other words the proposal is to engage in a discussion between the csm and ccp where nothing specific is decided beforehand. in such a situation the csm reps would have freedom to make whatever suggestions they feel needed to be changed in capital ships without first presenting the suggestions to the subscriber base or even to the rest of the csm representatives.in essence, if this proposal were approved for escalation, it would allow suggestions on capitals to be sprung full blown upon a csm/ccp meeting without prior notice to the public, other csm representatives or ccp itself. this would bypass the regular methods of input from the subscriber base, discussion in the csm meetings and notification period ccp requires.any opposition to such ambush like suggestions would not have time to research or word their response while the person offering the suggestions would have had time to create a presentation.as far as the subscriber base is concerned? we'd find out about the suggestions and their implementations after they'd already been accomplished.windjammer"
"a discussion where we could hear ccp's open ended ideas on where to take it for the community as a whole to look at."
"ccp already dispenses information on their ideas in dev blogs whenever they wish that information to be divulged. further, the op's proposal is designed to present ccp with ideas, not necessarily the other way round.windjammer"
"present ideas nothing says that they have to implement them it would be something to think about open up a dialog and discussion so we know the limitations and other factors that would allow people to present new and better ideas that are in the realm of possibility."
"literally, this is a request by the op to present suggestions to ccp in the name of the csm without informing anyone of what all those suggestions will be.ideas which are presented to ccp from the csm are suggestions to ccp as to what the csm would like to see happen and by extension are presumed to be the desires of the csm's constituency, the subscriber base.the op's proposal would be a way to present ideas that avoid input (either support or opposition) from the subscriber base or other csm representatives. further it would do so over an unlimited range of unspecified suggestions regarding capital ships.currently the csm votes whether or not to bring specific suggestions to ccp. these suggestions must have been on the forums for 7 days to allow for subscriber input and discussion. if approved for escalation by vote of the csm, the suggestion is assigned a proponent to make the presentation to ccp. ccp is given ample notice to consider the pro's and con's of the suggestion. that way everyone goes to a meeting prepared to discuss it. for all practical purposes the op may as well have said, \"let's have a discussion with ccp regarding eve\".as far as discussion? that's what the forums are for, aren't they?windjammer"
"can you stop signing you post we all know who you are.also of the csm representatives quite a few of them only really would care about two of the capital ships and know less about the others. the two they would know are freighters and jump freighters because they are the only two allowed in hi sec. ankh only went to low sec to cap things in faction warfare and did not kill any one so i really can't believe she would know heads from tails about dreadnoughts or carrier combat. they go against jades view of the game and how it is played so he would not care if they are brought up. bane knows more about them than just about anyone i know. darius flies three or four of them on his accounts and has experience with them. harden is in 0.0 so he at least has a view on how they affect the game. inanna is a carebear who they do not affect. and all the other members would have free discussion on their views on it all also. so it would not just be the bane glorious power hour."
"one of the major problems with drones and their various modules, issues of lack of implants and balancing is that they are used on so many ships in so many factions.the balance issue is the main reason for the lack of drone implants, modules and new drones (that don't cost 10 mil and 100 hours of farming each to find and make).by limiting what ships can use what drones, the balance issue is fixed and new things can be implemented toward the use of drones without making them overpowered.if a ship is built with the use of drones in mind then is should be made so that its existance does not prevent new drones or modules from being introduced by its mere existance.they are on everything.but you cant introduce a more powerful light drone now because all the ships with 25m3 drone space or more just got a boost.you cant make more interesting and useful drones because the ships they were not ment for can use them since their are only two factors governing drone use.bandwidth and drone bay space.vanilla controls over a very dynamic weapons system.also, pairing these with weapons that cant be destroyed makes them too powerful. the argument of \"just destroy them\" is wasted on the ship that doesnt use them as their primary weapon.light ecm drones are a great example of the problem. they allow for 5 jaming attempts per cycle. the break of the lock means a relock and they are trying to jam during this also. but any ship with 25m3 space uses them.because while drone ships have damage bonuses, all ships use the other drone types the same way.that is the flaw.as it stands now, you can not add modules or cybernetic implants or new powerful drones because they will be used on ships they were not ment to be used on and ruin the ship balance and role that ccp has been working toward.the existance of these ships prevents the addition of more drone content. that is just silly.please ccp, either make a flat limit on a ships drone type use, make them work less effectively on nondrone focused ships or add a new control along the lines of bandwidth that would regulate drone use by type.as it stands now, drones are a dead end weapons system because they are used as secondary weapons on so many ships. you cant boost or add to drone use for drone specialists because everyone would get the boost.so drones stagnate or get things like the augmented versions of drones. faction drones yes. powerful, yes. but so expensive to make even 5 it is sick. but using this kinda control makes them unusable and therefore a waste of time to design and emplement because of their lack of use. exotic drones that never see the light of day but how much design time was wasted on this?has anyone seen them being used?my point exaclty."
"it may require a major rewrite to the eve programming, but i do believe this would make eve an even more enjoyable game."
"as sad as it sounds, after reading that... i agree with goumindong. while its a nice idea.. that has to be the most horrible implementation of an idea i've ever read. that entire system removes gates as choke points, and if anything eve needs more chokepoints to funnel players through, setup on wildly divergent paths, so its hard to cover them all."
"while people are right in that it would certainly change eve dramatically i still thinkit might be worth some consideration afterall some aspects of it might well be implementable."
"hey,i just had an idea for eve that will help everyone when coming to the end of their subscription.why don't ccp introduce a device that after signing in, it tells you how much time you have left on your account before it expires.maybe even if it was just to work on the last 5 days of the account so that the owner can have time to sort his/her payment out without losing anytime ingame. (i had important stuffs coming up)i think this would be a good idea because it allows owners of expiring accounts to fit 'going to the bank' into their busy schedules.i for one am for this as i found out that my account expired yesterday, and didn't get paid until today and kind of missed the closing time at the bank because of my busy schedule. and i ain't spending 200+ million on a gtc. so i am going to have to wait until monday .so yeah, there is my idea... i hope people like it.mehez"

"the csm is a fail and was even before the voting.candidates were pushing their own agendas from the beginning and havent waivered from those positions, by only supporting player raised topics that align with their own views.ccp has made a career of denying and clouding issues rather than address them; the csm is just a logical extension of that poor game management. it would be a nice surprise if ccp canned the useless csm and hired professionals to actually do the job.no offense to the people that comprise the csm as i dont know any of you, my disdain is for the process and the procedures, not the players."
"since the mining overhaul thread is my favorite one and ccp is looking for more extensive ideas from the csm, i'm putting it up for vote here. this overhaul includes:- multi-ore asteroids, including changes to mining yield mechanics, survey scanners and modulated mining lasers to maintain functionality/support multi-ore asteroids.- removal/reduction of static belts and changing them into locations that need to be scanned down within defined areas. (this would also require the addition of locations that replace static belts for ratting purposes).- alloy mining which is a low volume, condensed mineral type of mining that requires high activity compared to the low maintenance ore mining, promoting agile ships for mining that have greater survivability in lower security.- comets and comet-mining, requiring new technology, for a interesting and bountiful new mining experience.- solar mining as an alternative to ice mining for simple isotopes, more efficient but more dangerous (does not yield liquid ozone, heavy water and strontium clathrates)- gas cloud harvesting expansion that will add more opportunities to use the skills and equipment outside booster production, yielding a wide variety of materials or new exotic substances.support this is you want mining to be of greater variety, offer more choices and be much more fun."
"i want the asteroids opened to all security levels in a region but have higher and lower yeilds depending on native sec status. 1.0 gives like 10% yield arkonor and -1.0 gets like 5-10x yeild veldspar.i want medium and heavy mining drones and an ore specialty (or gallente heck why not) mining ship with bonus for mining drones. i support that there are several more fun things mining could get."
"i support expanding on mining options. well thought out threads this is linked to."
"yes"
"supported...with two thumbs if i could do that"
"you may remember me making a post a long time ago about neutral logistics repairing wartargets without getting a combat timer (ie, they can dock or jump instantly).faction warfare has escalated this to a new level.now we can have heavily-tanked wartargets in high-sec that tank the faction navy with the help of 'neutral' remote-repair ships that can jump or dock immediately, and not only that, but they don't get shot by the faction navy. this means that hostiles can go anywhere they want in hostile space as long as they have a few neutral reppers with them. on top of that, because of the random spawning of the faction navy, the neutral doesn't need to repair all of the wartargets - the faction navy will not attack some of them no matter how long they sit there.my proposal has expanded:1) logistics should give you a combat timer - you remote-repair a war target, you can't dock or jump for a while, just the same as if you shot someone. this was the proposal from part 1.2) if you remote-repair someone in a militia, you flag to the enemy militia - players and npcs. this means that if you repair a militia member in hostile high-sec, a navy detachment will spawn to attack you as well.3) the faction navy should spawn per hostile after a set period of time, instead of spawning for a particular number of them, and generally not attacking certain people. this ensures that any incursion is met with an appropriate level of force."
"i can agree to it, and it makes sence ;)"
"make sense."
"actively repairing someone whos a whos got an aggression time is like aiding crimals in rl. if you choose to help some one with a aggression then your actively commiting the same act as he it. they should be flagged."
"i agree, just one in a number of loopholes that need to be closed"
"not signed.i can understand proposal 2, but not 1 and 3.logistic ships and rr is used elswhere also, not only in high sec by militia."
"if you rr someone that has a global criminal counter you will be flagged and get a gcc yourself.if you remote rep someone who is in war, you will be flagged to his wartargets. so everything you said should be, is allready."
"1 is reasonable, 2 is necessary, but i don't like 3 - i prefer the idea of putting together a big enough force for high-sec raids."
"akiba: where else would #1 be an issue, really? repping pos's? you have a giant bloody force field there, right? repping people in your gang? you're getting shot at anyway right? the only people #1 really affects is people who rely on station-tanking to keep their logistics ships alive. everyone else can wait for a minute or two to dock again."
"from the top of my head;one situation iv been in several times is when you attack a gatecamp and they lit up a cyno and drop a few carriers on you. since most of the gang is tackled we stay on the gate and rr while we wait for the timer to pass so we can jump.i dont see the need for giving rr a combat timer, just because some militia dudes is playing the docking game with you.edit:fix the docking mechanism instead,, thats whats broken imo."

"i think the problem here might be that, as much as i like eve, there are still way too many problems in the present to be thinking much about the future.once they have ironed out all (or at least most) of the current problems, then people will start thinking about the future. seems to me this lead dev seriously underestimates the importance of some of these issues to the players.judging by my entire online-gaming experience though, fixing most current issues is wishful thinking as every gaming company seems more interested in creating new issues rather than fixing old ones..."
"although some of you have made some nice analogies i don't see it as an either/or thing. overall, i believe ccp addresses bugs and balance issues very well considering the magnitude of the game and the effects that fixes have on everyone. at the same time i want to see the game grow up.i raised two children. my overall goal was to help them grow up into mature adults. there were \"bugs\" along the way, and we fixed those we could, but the overall goals was to keep them growing in the right direction. that is the way i see eve."
"i had kinda some of those thoughts in a much less blunt, rude and angry fassionit seems expectations were different from this particular ccp boss. it is always frustrating to be poked about items in your todo pile, or have things added to it even. but my initial thought to it was actually, tough break mate. it seems more of a priority for the community to have a working game with its current features and a few minor addons than it is to get \"all against the joveans\" or \"planetart veichle race\" in 3 to 4 years. on a good note though it just means that your product is good and we like it alot...."
"actually some of us have grand ideas. many prominent industrialists and traders in the md forums have posted literally tomes of grand ideas to take the economy of this game into new areas and directions, expanding it into a real sandbox. allowing both the new player to experience without such high competition barriers like now, and allowing the older player to scale their play so that the time invested allows larger benefits.....but for those ideas to work, it requires bugs, ui changes, and changes in how the market works.i've seen grand ideas in the cnp forums, but during the discussion of those ideas, inevitably someone always points out that unless a is fixed, this b will never work right and will only make issues c and d.sorry.. the game is pretty ****ing grand and wide. it has a metric ton of content that most games can only dream of (seriously think of the scale and the number of items...) but right now it's time to hone down and focus on polish instead of adding content."
"this.actually i haven't followed much the csm thingy, just voted and hoped for the best. some good work has been done. now i read this interview and got on my nerves really.won't start on how inefficient the game industry is and ccp slowness, the all so important burocratic process that grow up with company grow (aka 3 devs doing more than a staff of 300), etc. but please, do you think we are stupid ccp? first fix and improve stuff and then we can talk about grand visions which you will say 'this is a no cause blabla'."

"great, hopefully this is what we need to make this idea reality!"
"just like you said at the end of you original post shar, thinking about the datacore pile you have waiting, and the seemingly impossibly long 60 day skill finished up is a damn good reason to start playing eve again if you were previously inactive."
"this i will support, but getting a long skill trained while the account was inactive is a great way to lure back players. the change of gtc to 60 days and a little higher cost was probably partially motivated by the people training 1 month in 1 month out but much more buy the rp farming operations."
"you \"gain\" a storyline every 16 r&d missions too. for me it was way more useful than the rp point gains.if that was ever done that way, it was well before the datacores, i started my first r&d agent in may 2006 and she gave me rp even the days i wasn't missioning for her. you can have all the issues you want with people running afk with haulers, but that don't make you \"all\". some people has issues with that, other people think that is someone is willing to risk his stuff going afk instead of piloting a 30-40 jump in high sec it is his right. please use real numbers, not make belive. 5 top agents (all level 4, with the appropriate player science skill at 5 (all level 4, 0 or more quality) give out about 500 rp/day. datacores go for less than 300k normally. so it is 3 millions/day, less than 1 hour of mining veldspater."
"i disagree!for a player to continue to gain sp and rp is a great hook. it distinguished eve from all the other games.my account has never stopped and i have never benefitted from this, but if i had to go away for a year (say national service or lack of funds after a baby born, etc) these things make eve a game i am more likely to return to.look. it costs nothing. it is not really an exploit. in the long run it makes ccp more money and therefore keeps this game going.let the expired accounts continue to earn something so they come back.no."
"a thousand times this. was going to reply, fortunately read ahead before opening my big mouth for once . rooker says it perfectly. please tell me you're kidding? think about this statement really hard for a while."
"my personal view has always been that if you aren't an active player (in this case defined as a *paying* player) then you shouldn't expect to gain the benefits of being a paying player - ie sp and rp.i - unofficially - raised this at the recent ccp-csm meeting in passing on another subject and it was indicated to me from the ccp side that they saw this as beneficial to enticing people back into eve if they feel they need to take a break from regular play. i'm still uncertain about it, though setting a long skill to level 5 and disappearing off for that period without paying is (to me, anyway) clearly gaming the system. commercially though it might well be better for ccp in the longer run to permit this. iz"
"sorry, nope, not in a million years. i have this thing called real life, and the fact that eve does not have to become a second job for me is one of the primary reasons i play. the sp gain while account is inactive is relatively minor benefit - since the skill training stops once the skill is finished.the rp gain while account is inactive is also a relatively minor thing, since those accounts are reactivated to collect the rp and the benefit of isk/cash is small. sorry not supported ever.oh, and since you consider using an indy with 1 miner ii to mine a large veldspar asteroid for a while \"lame\" - i can see that you obviously have no notion that eve is not a #1 priority of majority of the players - and at the same time it is beneficial to gain some resources while we do things like work, and household duties and things of such nature. again, eve is not a second job for most of us - and those two things you mention are actually of an extreme benefit for majority of the players."
"your defense of your real life simply comes across quite shakespearean; \"you doth protest too much.\" somehow you are connecting your real life demands in connection with \"inactive players\" and blurring the lines to \"active customers\". it's a false argument that you've given in entirety and one can only assume that you either have misread the idea or your evepeen is heavily invested in using inactive accounts so that you don't have to play eve like the rest of us who do not. you know, those of us who play the game fairly without exploiting the system??<sobs>\"waaaaaah, i wanna pvp all the time. damn people who try to change my eve from 'counterstrike' online!!!!\"</sobs>cry us a bloody river and go back to posting how you drink carebear tears. must make your whine go down better. nvm, discussing this with someone so obviously lame is not worth any of my time. in game or 'real life'."
"this has been discussed long enough so i'm just going to close with this: being an american i've seen what becomes when you set up a welfare state. inactive account skillpoint gain is not that and i probably should have brought it up in a different thread entirely.inactive account research point gain is the foundation of a welfare state. it is an automatic stipend that destroys an causality between reward and risk/effort.however if the so called majority is in favor who am i to fight that... i'm just going to do all i can to poison the well entirely. i'll just go on and detail the exact steps to game the system so that there can be hundreds of accounts per each player gaining research points. where will your real life be then? when everyone is doing it? short-sighted self-entitled fools. no wonder you need to exploit. ta-ta now, gotta go use my non-exploiting success to go open a dozen accounts."
"ok, lets see:the quote is: \"the lady doth protest too much, methinks.\" from hamlet. however, you, as majority of unwashed masses, misinterpret what \"protest\" means. you view it as \"denial\" or \"disagreement\" when it really means, at least in shakespeare, to \"argue for,\" to \"vow\" and to \"solemnly declare.\" in other words, \"protest\" is not a juxtaposing view of the subject under discussion, but quite the opposite, the desire to \"argue for the subject,\" so elaborate, so \"artful,\" so full guile, that it undermines the credibility of the one who argues. which, to further infer, using the quote, means that you are the one who \"doth protest too much, methinks\" for your chosen subject, to the point of loosing all credibility in the process. you are using every tool in the forum troll's arsenal to quash down any opposing view, and argue so vehemently for your proposal, with flame and trolling, to the point that, indeed, you loose all credibility in the matter. it is hard to see what you are arguing for, other than maximizing your personal gain, you attribute \"intent\" to me for example, of being a \"cs crybaby,\" while i i am not a fan of the game, which you would not know, of course. or, you take the position of mysterious \"us,\" thus assuming that while you have 5 supports in this thread and many more denials of your idea, trying to add weight to an argument which is lost. oh, and just to clarify things, i have two accounts: one is for jb as pure combat, and the other one is a 100% carebear t2 manufacturer and inventor. as such, again, you assumed that i was relying on \"inactive/active\" game to make isk in game, again falsley. if you took the time not to run headlong into a brick wall, and flame and troll in your own thread, you would have realized that i am arguing against your idea because it is detrimental to the majority of the players who have come to rely on that extra time when the account goes inactive to train that particular skill, or the meagre rp collected while they are inactive, as opposed to being tied to eve 23/7. that is why the developers of eve, as stated by the csm representative, are reluctant to change the system, the benefit of retaining the players is far outweighing the small and perceived inconvenience of those who would \"protest too much\" for their idea while representing it as the \"common goal.\"best of luck to you in your next fallacy."
"i have highlighted some trolling and flaming. 1) i am an american, and i disagree with you 100%. please do not use national distinctions to argue for things in a \"make belief\" universe of eve. it really means that you are taking the game too seriously and need a break. 2) if you refrained from trolling your own threads and creating a flame-bait posts, you probably would have had greater success in the matter. furthermore, the \"so called majority\" comment pretty much assures us of your contempt for the real majority who mostly disagreed with you in a polite manner, and were repaid back by you with contempt, flames and insults. 3) although i might agree with you in \"principle\" that gaining rp while inactive is not the best idea, and as a t2 manufacturer would probably support it in the long run, the benefit of retaining a greater eve population, in my opinion, far outweighs the detriment of the so called \"stipend.\"edit:i might further add that the datacores are not \"bough back\" from the players by ccp, and are actually traded as a commodity between the players' themselves, as such do not constitute a ccp sponsored \"stipend\" in any way. since it is not \"free isk\" given out each month. it still requires one to buy a gtc, collect the datacores, haul them to whatever current beneficial market, and wait for them to sell to other players."
"it is no more \"gaming the system\" than having that same level 5 skill training when you go to sleep. they designed it this way intentionally and for a reason. when i was without internet for 3 months (thx embarq morons), i almost didn't come back. but then i realized a long and very nice lvl5 skill had finished, so i patched the client, logged back in and prompty bought a time code (that somebody else bought from ccp)."

"would make sense, altho if one corp within alliance joins militia it should block possibility for other corps in same alliance join opposing 2 militias (nothing wrong if corps join say amarr and caldary or minamatar and gallente militias)."
"ok, so to help make it a stepping stone, we isolate fw players in their own bubble where they cannot interact with alliance communities, and set the game up so that their entire corp has to move from fw into 0.0 at the same time, and so they cannot have experienced alliance politics or organisation before they move?genius design.(already supported)"
"i support this, though am unsure on implementation"
"supported.its simply a matter of allowing an alliance to join only one faction, with the executor corp applying for the faction. naturally it will then be a matter of internal debate as to which faction should be joined."
"i would support this if it meant alliances had to sign off their ability to take sov. half and half wouldn't cut it, either dedicate to faction warfare, or dedicate to 0.0. it's gamebreaking any other way."
"new discussion thread here:"
"i support the expansion of mining."
"mining is fine. you get to do it semi-afk, you get to pretty much warp in on your choice of belt and get a go at it, and you can do in virtually every system in eve. you are still making good money, even if its not the best in the game.this needs a boost.. why?"
"because its a dead eny profession right now. given its the most important profession in the game (almost everything needs minerals to be made) thats quite a shame."
"why is it a bad thing? for what, an investment of roughly 5-6 million skill points, you get a viable profession that are you practically maxed out in. you can do it afk, you can do it with multiple accounts, you can do it out in 0.0 and probably rival what an npcer can get out there.a mission runner in a turret bs would just need that in gunnery alone. even a cruise raven would take a decent while longer to max out your skills."
"only if you are using a macro script, otherwise you need to be there to move it to the station, change roids etc.you can mission with multiple accounts as well, a cleaner and a fighter.i lol'd. nowhere near it, and that was when i was out there. with market prices dropping, its probably gotton worse.i have less then 1.5mil sp in combined guns, drones and missiles, and probably less then 3 mil of my sp total dedicated to fighting and tanking skills. i can solo most of the lower lvl 4's in a passive phoon. you were saying something amusing about comparative skillpoints i believe?"
"what we should be asking for is exactly the opposite of that. we need a class of mining ships that are _durable_. enough to tank a small gang of pirates until help gets there."
"well then you must either be doing something wrong with the way that you mine or you're in the wrong region. i've done mining in a handful of 0.0 regions and i can tell you that there are regions out there that have either poor belts, poor mineral markets, and/or sovereignty instability which can make mining something that you hate. conversely, there are regions that are \"golden\". case in point, i've recently moved to a 0.0 region new to me and mining couldn't be better. in about two or three weeks i've made around 500m in profit spending about 1 to 2 hours a day at it. i'm gonna guess that its probably a joke because there is little risk to high sec miners. i'm willing to bet that very few high sec miners get suicide ganked and the only risk i see in high sec mining is losing mined ore out of a jetcan (if you jetcan mine....many don't)."
"this thread was meant to be an experiment in so called democracy - was primarily due to the fact that there is a vocal minority who always whines about t2 bpos and a challenge to them to put their money where their mouth is. i did not see those whiney alts here, so.... i officially declare an experiment a success - more people want to whine and ***** and moan about the t2 bpos than they really want to find the truth, or have a definitive answer."

"a light freighter would be nice around the 250k-350k range."
"supported, i dreaded training freighter just to move around 100,000m3 of stuff and for a long time i just did multiple trips if the route was short enough. i'm sure most others had to same feeling.so yes, a smaller cheaper freighter would be used a lot more then ccp realise i believe."
"posting in support."
"i support this idea.i would love to see a smaller freighter, but nothing more then 100,000 m^3. after all, some freighter pilots do make money hauling large amounts of freight and wouldn't want to ruin it for them. especially since they did train all the way up and buy a full sized freighter."
"enough to carry three bs at fully fitted, rigged, trained for the smaller freight would suffice for me."
"then allow me to clarify. while the csm was originally conceived as a response it was eventually decided that ccp's internal affairs department would handle such situations. the idea of what the csm would be evolved into what it is today. an entity wholly seperated from dealing with avoidance, reporting or correction of any possible internal affair at ccp.thus when i say, \"the csm was not formed because of the banned individuals revelations.\", it is entirely true and correct. the csm which exists was not formed because of those revalations. and when i say, \"ccp did institute an internal investigation process largely because of incident kug publicized, but this has little or nothing to do with the csm.\", that too is self evidently true and correct.kugs revelations may have provided a catalyst to form a type of csm, but they have nothing to do with the csm which was actually formed.windjammer"
"like most players, i will never know all the details, and frankly, it does look like ********** did us all a service by providing evidence.but let's be clear: he did not make ccp look stupid, he simply gathered facts. now i have used google to locate lots of corp and alliance out-of-game conversations, and reading a publicly-available web site forum is not exactly hacking.if ccp looked stupid, it was not his fault. i think ccp should no only unban him, but make him a special representative to the csm, and empower him to act like the player's investigator (we need that!) but future allegations of dev or gm misconduct.oh, and before someone thinks i am in any way affilliated with pandemic legion, i have seen some sniggs in the game and was podded once by them, but i am not an alt in any way and normally not be sympathetic. but this makes ccp look like gangsters!ccp: hear the players, serve the players, not just take the players' money!i vote unban"
"there are many reasons why kugs should remain banned. here's just one:he broke the rules of the game. if ccp unbanned him, it could be seen that they therefore endorse his methods, which they obviously don't otherwise they wouldn't have banned him.plus, you don't seriously think kugustumen has stopped operating within eve just because his current account/s got banned at that time?"
"what rules?considering he admits he doesn't play; yeah, i think that's a safe assumption to make."
"i wouldn't admit to playing again if i were him, even if i were.really though, the lengths that ccp took initially to bury the issue and telling people to foad if they didn't like it made them very much in the wrong. the could have removed the illegal bpos at the time of discovery and it would have made it a much more moot point.there should be a whistleblower provision given to kug, as it has improved the game and made ccp get serious about game integrity."
"marisal, that i can recollect, the original ban on ********** was stated as being for posting rl info on another player. half the posters were up in arms because sirmolle had also posted **********'s rl info on these forums but was not banned. given this was at the t20 ground zero time, it was not a wise move by ccp. they then \"clarified\" that it was the eula workload violation, a horrifically vague catch-all. sirmolle stills seems to be playing. i'd go looking around for the relevant links/threads but my internet is behaving like an asthmatic sloth at the moment.since this took me about ten minutes to do - stoopid intarweb - are you against the unbanning of **********? do you think he was fairly treated? do you support the idea of a banning review in general but not for him?(apologies if you've already stated your position, trying to load pages right now on my connection would make baby jesus cry)"
"so is this a \"vote yes if you are in pandemic legion/goonswarm and friends\" and \"vote no if you are bob and friends\"??i tried to do a bit of research but couldn't immediatly find out, what corp was ********** in?the topic refers generally to banned players but seems like it is very specific to just this guy."
"ohhhh... all great ideas, really. also, how about using the elite officers faction (maybe mordus or eom) to offer a faction command, recon and logistics ship?requires less skills but not as robust as the empire faction ships, maybe with some slight nerf to the command/recon.logistic bonuses?it might offer people a way to experiement with these skills before they commit to seven weeks training or more.side comment to the reaction to my idea about a sisters of eve faction set: i did want to specialize the soe faction to be good a survival but weak on defense, all ships do not have to be pvp buffs!oh, and to the guy who suggested an ore faction, yes, they could have faction version of the mining barges (not exhumers though) to give advanced (exhumer-like) abilities to miners who lack all the skills. more cargo space, mining bonuses, a little faster and a little stronger. add a faction hauler from them too maybe.good ideas all, hope ccp is aware of this.still, great thread, thanks to fallorn for a good idea."
"main thing i want is an even number of ships for each space ship command skill to help with. i mean its not like one it matters much since i am working on getting ever races cruiser to 5 and i already have all their weapon systems up to cruiser lvl t2. i just want caldari amarr people to have the same footing as gellente minmatar and right now they have 3 less ships."
"the only way i would support this is if the skill queue was limited. like, only allowed up to level 3 skills or something."
"i agree with this. this is a game and people should be need to actually play it to be able to progress. since skills continue training even after your account is suspended(or at least did so a few months ago) one could stop playing for a year and so some really long skill training, maybe 3-5 months, and then another one equal in length straight after and with out having to play the game."
"yes yes yes yes i've been muttering about this since, oooh, when i started playing in 2003"
"i support i guess but i am confused.so before this counsil thing the eve community wanted \"a response to (said topic)\" and now we have a way of saying we \"offically want a response to (said topic)\""
"with people in fw posting in general topics & on coad, we need a place where they can post about subjects on fw. this will clean up the mess a little.fay"
"agreed"
"agree"
"ccp is slow"
"corporation, alliance and organization discussions - organization can equal militia. \"this is the corporation and alliance version of the intergalactic summit. all interaction on this forum is in-character and between corporations or alliances, not individual characters.\" seems appropiate. but no one wants to post there because of the crap that is posted in there. blame your fellow players for this. but it provides an ooc forum to discuss things.corporations and alliances summit - change title to corporations, alliances, and militias summit. \"this forum is for the discussion of ingame politics, conflicts, and other matters regarding player corporations, alliances and organizations in eve. news and press releases may also be posted here for information and/or discussion.\" in-character forum. to be honest a lot of igs stuff should probably go here but since igs is much more active. the rp in the past has been small so i suspect people rather just put stuff where the most traffic is and it wasn't here. this is a good candidate to be 'adopted' for factional warfare material.intergalactic summit (aka igs) - \"an in-character, roleplaying area for forum members to plot, scheme, forge alliances or declare intentions of war.\" this is a regular discussion for people involved in factional warfare among other things. it's in-character so some of the rabble is filtered out. currently much discussion about fw is happening here.factional warfare is born in roleplay just like everything technically is. try it out you may like it and find it makes the game a little more than just something like a shooter. so no, you do not need a forum, but you may want to suggest changing descriptions of current forums. in the meantime just bring up topics there."
"who posts seriously in caod though?"
"too bad, because you just barely missed the argument as to why your entire preemptive counter-argument is null and void.no, a lot more players won't become miners that will go mining veldspar in highsec, simply because highsec mission-running is a lot more profitable than mining veldspar, even if only taking into account the raw bounties (if you add the rest of the things like lp, loot and salvage, it becomes insanely more profitable), and that in the situation where veldspar might as well just be the best thing to mine in highsec and lowsec combined.if you want to go that way, then you have to seriously nerf the income potential of highsec missions... and i seriously doubt you want to see the feedback to that change."
"this is the way to go, they don't belong in high sec as i argued before, its the missions that really break risk reward as they are not set in the correct security for the rats they involve."
"good luck even trying to suggest that. in the original thread, the hint at negligibly nerfing highsec mission runner \"mineral income\" (not even significantly altering actual isk income) was met with utter hostility. now, imagine that, but from half the player base (if not more), and much stronger.feel free to post something to that extent and see the reactions.for that reason, sadly, if ccp is to do that, it's as if they would shoot their own foot."
"i think it would make sense to move this issue a bit higher in priority list. there has been a while now since dev's last acknowledged the problem."
"it can be done with ease.all melting results in a loss, somewhere.. somehow. doesn't even have to be a lot really, but just enough that it combined with the increased size of modules makes looting mods for mission runners that much less attractive and time wasting.use the gentle hand method."
"you forgot to check the checkbox saying \"check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on\" and here's a typical sampling of minerals you get right now out of melted loot out of a small mission set : 3.68 mil trit, 1.4 mil pye, 0.44k mex, 97.2k iso, 12.9k nocx, 1.4k zyd, 1.1k mega.as you can see, there's a heavy excess of isogen and megacyte in refined loot.and it's not just that. like i said, even completely ignoring lp, loot and salvage, you still make more isk/hour running l4 missions than you make mining anything in both highsec or lowsec right now... ...and if you add all the other things too, it becomes a lot less interesting to mine, only an option if you do it mostly afk."
"i wholeheartedly agree with op.perhaps insurance should be sent to the character that got ganked rather than being completely voided."
"not everyone is able to afford or willing to pay for a second account to scout for them.instead of providing a second solution you insult us, and then tell us what we already know, thanks!"
"scouting is just one solution, there are others and i'm not here to tell you how.as for not having second acc for scouting, how about your work together with other mission runners and catch on to the \"multi player\" side of the game.you all seem to be happy with voiding insurance for suicide ganks, i'm telling you now the people who do it properly wont be put off at all by no insurance, myself included.if they void insurance and people are still getting suicide ganked i'll bet my left testicle you'll be back here asking for nerfs/changes whatever instead of solving a simple problem with a bit of common sense, which is what you should be doing now tbh."
"supported all the way"
"i agree its to easy to gank in highsec."
"take away the insurance payout if you get concorded and that will help balance this play style a lot."
"stop trying to spin this. you are trying to make it sound like people are worried about accidentally shooting something and getting concorded, that is not anywhere close to what they are talking about.this is about the current system. basically it is all reward. it needs to be risk vs. rewardcurrently there is zero risk at all."
"remove the skills, let new players start with higher attributes and make implants the only thing one can do to speed up skill training."
"i would love this, to be honest, and yes, i am 4/4 on nearly all of my learnings. to be honest, the older players do not comprehend how much of a show-stopper this is for the newer players. trial accounts only last two weeks, which isn't enough time to even get all the learnings done. when the first thing you tell someone as they join the game is that they have to train skills so they can train skills, they instantly think that the rest of the game is going to be just like that. mind-numbingly boring.i believe someone said that 18 million isk isn't much at all. you must've started eve a looooong time ago, cause that actually is a lot of isk for a newbie. taking off the weeks of training time when they first start would go a long way towards putting people in the eve experience, and having fun in it, rather than feeling like they have to grind (and customer retention). i have something like 800k sp in learnings, and i would be more than happy to give it up to have more people play the game. some of the vets have gotten so obsessed with sp, that they can't stand the thought of having 1.2 mil less. so, remove learnings, and pin on that permanent sp."

"you can keep the band, give me the exotic dancers! i'm not actually referring to the ice products; there is a player source of that. what i would be interested in would be items like robotics, oxygen, uranium and the other 'station maintenance' items. things that would have a logical industrial tail before they got to us, as pilots. i would like to see the ability to control that logistics tail. i think that npc demand and supply of goods and services is important. i do not advocate dropping all npc supply, just creating a parallel system for pilots to create the same types of maintenance related items currently only 'created' and sold in empire and npc stations now. i think that there are two issues with this. o first, the most delicate balancing act for a massive change like this would be balancing the economic price shocks. if a system like what i am talking about is ever implemented there would need to be npc supply or the economy would go absolutely berserk, cattle would cost 1,000,000 isk each (if demanded as food stocks on stations, people would run missions just looking for that precious space cattle can) and oxygen or robotics could end up costing 10x or 50x its current rate which would unbalance pos supplies and costs all over eve, which effects moon minerals then reactions and t2 parts and then everything advanced. o second, developing then seeding the system and its associated resources, both the new factories, parts, bpos, skills and the physical resources, available on orbital bodies are going to probably be a chore on par with all three of the revelations trinity expansions. some remedies for this could be to make land 'leases' available on empire and lowsec worlds, (the more secure the higher the price?) similar to station offices, or charged as 'extras' to offices in local npc stations. maintaining npc supply would be inline with story line, after all if i was ceo of the caldari navy (or insert your favorite) i would want to have someone in my faction involved in producing the fuels i need to run my stations. adding a level of station demand for maintenance commodities could also be a nice way to start traders with some basics early in their careers. the possibilities are immense with something like this. taark"
"a lot of good thoughts here."
"i disagree on exploration complexes. they are fine in how long it takes to find them. i don't want the exploration profession turned into a sideshow that everyone has an alt for, simply because they are everywhere and easy to find. i like the idea of someone having to dedicate the sp to get exploration skills, and then dedicate chunks of time into that gameplay goal, to make money at it. i'm all for normal missions, or cosmos missions becoming easy to find and do for groups. i'm not okay with exploration missions becoming easy to find for groups. by their very nature they should be hard to find, it wouldn't be called exploration if they were in the sort of abundance you're talking about."
"i used 2 characters of mine.but they are on different accounts"
"i brought this up before and could not find it again. it mainly met with approval.1) jump clone vat pos array as its name suggests is a pos deployable array.2) it comes in various sizes - maybe from 5 to 25 slot versions.3) it will be reasonably expensive to purchase - say about 100 million isk for the smallest version.4) it will require a substantial amount of cpu and power to be online.5) it will consume an additional fuel to further increase logistical costs: biogel.6) it can be used by any corporate member (maybe alliance as well)7) in effect it will function like a capital clone vat array but fixed in one place., without the need for the whole hassle of having the capital pilot online.please see: this post here in the ideas section for more details"
"sure, i like it. but be prepared for the outcry of those who would say that it is giving too much to 0.0 alliances, and of those who say it is giving too much to empire pos carebears. anyway, no pleasing all, but i like the idea and it is easily implemented."
"video is renedered by client not server. lag is excess for lezines of devs. how can you reneder char portreits in game but not custom logos at ships ? zomg laggorz"
"such a nice idea to have alliance/corp logo's on ships :)and all the guys that keep posting lag lag lag, please read what other people have told you, you wont feel a different at all!"
"/signed for corp/alliance logos on ships.paintjobs is a more complex issue, i would only support it if they consisted of limited themes that remained distuinguishable from t1 and t2. so, caldari ships get a set of themes for their t1 ships and then each t2 npc company (like viziam, carthum, core complexion, thukker mix, etc) get a set of themes for its t2 ships.this would therefore remove not only confusion between t1 and t2 ships and also between t2 variants of the ship, but would also ensure that all the limited themes remained inside the spirit of the game.faction ships should probably remain unchangeable in this regard."
"alliance logos on ships would add zero lag. the logos already exist as icons in your eve install, and the client must already know the alliance of a ship/pilot to draw the ticker in space, on the overview, for standings, etc.100% signed and there's no reason not to have it.corp logos would have to be rendered/cached which might take a few milliseconds but that's no excuse not to do something."
"greetings.i would like to see the option of other players entering your ship, lets say a carrier or other ships, riding along as passengers or deployable teammembers for tactical operations.not unlike the galaxy transportships as done in planetside.those riding along cant do anything beside sitting either in their ship in the hangar, or sitting in an capsule in the hangar, and are subject to instakill if they fail to launch or exit during an attack for whatever reason that pops the carrier. make carriers more carrier-like if you will.would expand the playing experience and purpose for ships like carriers and similar, to have fellow corp members or other people onboard for tactical work.im sure you can imagine the coolness-factor of launching your frig from a carrier in some enemy territory in order to conduct havoc or tactical maneuvers.kuzya."
"motherships effectively provide this functionality already, through the clone vat bay. also, please note the existence of the features and ideas discussion forum."
"not just on the forums but ingame, there are spaces where the alliance you're in should show, but are blank if your corp is in fw.just sayin'."
"this would be handy if they're introducing a separate fw forum tbh."
"the only issue here is that there is also discussion of allowing alliance members to join factional warfare. the mechanics of that are being discussed so it's not entirely clear how that may happen, if it happens at all.however, i agree that there should be some sort of ingame indicator, similar to that of the alliance indicator, if there is not already."
"ain't that the truth..."
"agreed a million times over. it's like everyone in the story department copy-pastad the whole \"let us all unite\" idea over everything.....i wonder if the pirate factions will unite against the empires."
"++"
"yeah, we could at least then have a sticky with a list of topics already discussed. that would be the easiest way to do it and check it."
"a stickied list would be nice."
"serenity steele already has the index topic which has icons for issues which are proposed/voted on. it is a bit difficult to scan through to see just topics which have been discussed already, but then again, it is recommended that people visit that index regularly.i'll support the issue because it's important that the csm have a strong working system."
"i've just ranted about this in another thread, so +1 :)"
"if a player corp is in a fw corp they should not be allowed to war dec or be decced by another corp or alliance.it defeats the purpose of fw completly and does not allow full immersion into pvp as ccp claims.ccp has stated that alliances especially cannot join fw so they should not be allowed to war dec those already in fw. also corps within fw should not be able to war dec corps or alliances at all as that also defeats the general purpose of having fw.doing this will not keep the corps in fw safe as they have each other to deal with. but will even the playing field and not allow others to take advantage."
"massively exploitable. sign up with the caldari militia, keep your members out of gallente and minmatar space and you are a) immune to wardecs and b) at no risk from enemy militia factions; effectively, immune to everything except suicide ganks."
"no way. there'd be absolutely no threat or risk for corps this way. being in your militia's high sec means you pretty much safe, the navy npcs will go to great strides in keeping you alive."

"first up, i'm not a cap pilot. i don't ever want to be a cap pilot, and i generally dislike the entire idea of fleet ops which need cap warfare... as it pertains to my playstyle, i can understand how others would find them interesting. and, before anyone cries \"foul! you couldn't possibly make an informed opinion on them!\". i've never been shot either, but i've taken enough physics and biology to understand the mechanics of it, and know its something i'd rather not do. and as cap discussions are something you cannot visit the forum.. ever.. and not read about. i'd like to think between what i've read, and a very healthy bs detector.. that i know enough about caps to make a somewhat informed opinion on them as well. so.. lets go through the op's points.#1: titan overabundancei do not see the number of titans as an issue, instead i see the role that titans are currently setup to employ as the issue. the ddd is the second most ill-conceived thing ccp has put into the game, right after pos's being linked to sovereignty. the tank on the thing is laughably out of scale for its mass when compared with any other ship class in the game, and its lack of any true damage or support potential outside of the ddd simply shouldn't be allowed. the amount of poor planning in how they relate to cyno-jammers and lag on gate in of large assault fleets.. is simply staggering. so, how to fix. to be honest, as long as the ddd and cyno-jammers exist.. at the same time, titans will be busted. recommendation? nerf cyno jammers, and nerf damage on the ddd. at the same time give the thing a tank worth having, and implement some sort of new mechanic which makes it more worthwhile to leave a titan in a fight to possibly have it go boom, than it is to run and wait for ddd to recycle. my recommended nerf to cyno jammers is to make the things easily destroyed by small surgical strike teams of blackops groups. it'll give also give blackop and scout pilots a crucial role to fill."
"#2: carrier changes - helping find a new role for carriers that people will likemake a carrier an actual carrier. change how hot-drops work. you cannot hot-drop anything smaller than a capital. so if you want to bring non capital support ships... you're going to need a lot of carriers, and carriers are going to have to be reworked to allow it. give carriers a true repair yard, and docking system. a ship can dock with the carrier, and the carrier pilot can then put a ship or two into repair status. repairing inside a carrier will bring a ship back to near full status. requires spare parts. ships not being repaired can undock whenever the pilot of said ship feels like it, ships inside repair bay cannot. any ship inside the carrier when it goes, also goes. between managing modules, cap, repair bays, and fighters.. carrier pilots should hopefully be franticly clicking non-stop. if implemented right, they'll become the backbone of the fleet.#3: \"hot-drops\" and what can be done about themsee carriers. that alone should take a lot of the sting out of hotdrops, since you'll be unable to just willy nilly bring whatever you want to the engagement, but instead must manage docking space for anything beyond capitals that you want to bring.#4: the divide between veterans and new playersi also don't see this as a problem. new players have their place, same as old. i see the issue instead with current mechanics of fleet ops being completely based around gate camps and pos warfare. ccp's idea to bring sovereignty in line with faction warfare's objective based system of system ownership should, by itself, go a long way toward smoothing out the current issues with this."
"#5: the stratification between powergamers and more casual playersdon't even try to solve this issue. power gamers drive the game forward. if you try to make the impact power gamers can have on an engagement less.. in the end you'll only accomplish two things. one, giving casual players less to strive for. and two, dumbing the game down. you simply cannot have your cake and eat it too on this point. oh, you can try, but the game that has most got the mixture of hard-core and casual right already exists. its called world of warcraft. and i don't want to see eve become that. the only thing i'll really give you toward evening the playing field between casual players and power gamers is... the new player experience sucks. not just a little, but sucks on the scale of galactic blackholes, sucks. fix it to where after finishing an expanded tutorial, that casual gamers have an idea of the different roles they could possibly fill in eve and basic understanding of how they work, so new players have an idea of where they want to spend their skill points.. and it'll go a long way toward helping casual players actually make a meaningful contribution to the game. the new player experience is a particular pet peive of mine. old players can say its better than when they started, but the amount of content and possible paths of advancement since eve started has raised at an exponential rate, while tools to help players cope with all this content has largely remained stagnant. its a freak'n disgrace that a triple a game gives people so little in the way of tools to make informed decisions.#6: effects on 0.0 sovereignty since starbase warfare 2.0ccp is already looking at getting rid of it. i recommend not even discussing pos warfare and how it currently stands, but instead looking into ways to implement a highly modified version of factional warfare for system control that most of us can agree isn't completely bat**** crazy. at the same time, dreads need a very large look at, and revision in how they'll work once poss aren't of the monumental importance that they are now."
"#7: revisiting new anti-capital features and ships, such as the heavy interdictordon't nerf capitals. at least not in the classical sense of nerf. they should always have their place in standup fights. instead find ways to make standup fights less important. have control of sovereignty require things capitals just cannot do. pilot through small openings to get to a control point and pick up an item. timed events in which the mass and alignment speed of a capital just makes it near impossible for them to be able to enter. and many many more. capitals won't be nerfed, and fleets will have to bring well balanced forces if they want to control a system. at the same time, do not completely get rid of the idea of standup fights. they should still happen and exist for control of a system. but instead they should be more of a focus event, while all the other things required to flip the system take place on different grids inside the system.[*]imbalances within capital ship classes themselves (e.g. underpowered minmatar capitals)this is where my knowledge of capital class ships simply leaves me as useless. i understand the theory behind it all. but specifics i can't help you with."
"you are mistaken. if a csm representative makes a presentation at a csm/ccp meeting, that representative is speaking because his/her presentation has the approval of the majority of the csm. as such he/she is presenting to ccp on behalf of the csm and the csm's constituency.while the views he/she expresses during the presentaion may indeed be his/her own, they are still expressed on behalf of the csm. only in the discussion which follows a presentation may his/her statements be construed as his/her own and not a representation of the csm's desires and/or the desires of the subscriber base.windjammer"
"could a solution perhaps be:1. remove ships' innate \"drone bandwidth\" stat (for subcapital ships at any rate);2. change the drone control unit so that it can be fitted to any ship, and now generates 25mbit/sec (or something) of bandwith.result, any ship (with a drone bay) can still field drones, but as it needs to sacrifice a high-slot in order to do so, it becomes more of a considered loadout issue, as opposed to just \"yeah, and of course i'll chuck in a few hammerhead ii's on top\"."
"thats the main thing going for drones, to be able to expand the tactical options in various ships.specialized drone ships have a lot going for them. what other ship weapon system gets up to a 50% bonus to damage with a single ship bonus? ironically, a t2 hornet launched by a ship w/ a drone bonus becomes the \"improved and more powerful\" drone you want."
"\"fantastic idea\", now apply it to reality: drake: oh, wait, i just have that utility slot, 25 m3 of drones, perfectdominix: 5 high slots to usse 125 m3 of drones? yai for 1 gunraven: 2 utility? 50 m3 , perfectmyrmidion: 4 slots for the 100 m3and so on. it will help wonderfully non drone ships as they could use a utility slot to get 25 m3 of drones, while it will nerf dedicated drone ships that would use 4-5 high slots to use the drones. no wonder you will be suggesting a similar broken idea, you are caldari. little experience in drone ships?"
"of course you can, just make them take more bandwidth and/or require more drone skills and/or require a new module.everyone and his dog having access to the existing drones is one of the few things keeping nanoships in check. but nothing stops anyone designing new alternate types of drones with different fitting requirements."
"drones have hit the nerf bat to many times latly, leave them alone, last thing i need is even less dps on my myrmidon bc you want to use up all my highslots for fricking dcu's no supported. not even close."
"i'm not putting this forward as a completely finished idea. 25mbit/sec is a number i grabbed out of the air, and actual drone ships could retain a degree of innate bandwidth, and/or receive a bonus to control unit effectiveness.yup."
"many topics which belong in the features and ideas discussion forum are creeping into the assembly hall forum, probably because there is a misconception that developers are more likely to read content in this forum than that of the features and ideas discussion forum.food for thought:what are some guidelines we can establish? are these guidelines already established? if so, are they enough?is it necessary to change the description of these forums, or make some sort of statement?should developers be more active in displaying that they watch the features and ideas discussion forum?do developers really watch that forum enough?should the csm do something (similar to its issues index) to clean this forum of unwanted threads?"
"i think basically yes. i have cross-posted from the ideas forum because there *appears to be* no sign that the forum is looked at, and at least in this forum, if the idea is good enough, the csm will take it and plonk it in front of the devs. might take a bit longer to get there, but if you're passionate about your idea, you don't mind that. there is also no control in the ideas forum - the same ideas get posted over and over again as new posts, quickly pushing down other, potentially newer and better ideas. and, there seems to be much less traffic in that forum than here.so, all in all, the csm forum seems to me to be a far better place to post new ideas in than the ideas forum.i think a forum without content moderation (this applies to both the ideas section and csm forums) is inherently the wrong way to administer this. unfortunately, i think the only solution is pretty heavy moderation - where an issue only has one thread, and the moderator(s) move all new posts pertaining to that issue into that thread, therefore removing forum clutter. hopefully a better brain than mine can come up with a better solution - i'm against heavy-handed moderation on general principles but i can't think of better solutions.the process has not quite gone full circle yet though - maybe once the full details of the iceland meeting are public, there will be a clean up of this forum and the threads looked at moved elsewhere (maybe into the now non-existent proclamations forum), a summary given of what is being done, and all new threads on the subject referred to it and locked down in here.i suspect this is unlikely though."
"i suspect that because developers are rarely seen posting in the features and ideas discussion forum, players think it is not watched. the unruliness of the forum also contributes to this.the assembly hall is getting better, but i think it really comes down to people setting an example rather than forced moderation, at least for now.my personal proposal is that the csm create some sort of stronger guidelines to prevent this from happening. integrate it into another function of the csm, like i see ideas of rulebooks and whatnot being thrown around... i just want to make sure this is a consideration. also, because it involves the features and ideas discussion forum, it may involve action by ccp (hopefully nothing dramatic, a few forum posts or a devblog on features/ideas) and therefore the csm may want to deal with ccp themselves."
"on the first page alone, these are some topics i see that do not need to be here:[idea] some ships should be able to carry other players.[idea] paintjobs with corp and alliance logos on shipsjump clone vat pos arraylast wills and testaments.[idea] account timer thingy.(vision/idea) pirate faction ships[idea] small freighter [idea] custom paint for shipslots of these are in the commonly proposed ideas thread in features and ideas discussion."
"anyone else notice how many topics on the features and ideas forums are also going on the assembly hall forums?what's the point in making two forums for the same purpose of voicing opinions for change? and why bother making assembly hall, if they'll pay it as much attention as they have these threads."
"fyp."
"ideally...but from the looks of both pages, people are just having to fight the same arguments and raise the same points twice.it's bad enough that people say \"nerf titans\" or \"lets have wasd controls\" weekly, but having two forums with the same repeating topics will not end well.may just be me, but i'd suggest that csm and ccp both pay more attention to one, and get rid of the other completely. then people can make their suggestions once, instead of raising the same topics again and again in the hopes someone will eventually like it. don't ask your mom, and then ask your dad when she says \"no\". that sort of thing.especially since csm are more involved over here. they can be first to say \"that's already been discussed, and here's the link to continue.\" whereas features and ideas is just pages and pages of the same topics. nothing will get ironed out, when you have to repeat the same rhetoric weekly."
"i agree 100%, hence why i created this as an issue.don't mean to steal your thunder or anything, just thought i'd try to keep everything consolidated."
"supported."
"after flying a typhoon with an auto cannon and cruise combo (should have gone with torps in hind sight) i must not support this. with basic skills in gunnery (large obviously) you can do quite large dps, there is a decent falloff, and the things take no cap.as an exclusive auto cannon user, even i can not support this."
"it has come to my attention that in the event of an unforseen accident or natural death (and we have player who are in the armed forces) a ceo should be able to set a minimum number of days of inactivity on his/her account and if there is no action then a will is invoked and the ceo position passes to a preselected person. i realize there is an option for voting in a new ceo but i feel this would be a realistic addition to a ceo's powers. shares owned by the ceo would not go unused and funds split by shareholders would not go to a unused account. i think a last will and testament should be available to every player if not just the ceo's."
"interesting idea. how about if all items after predetermined time were put to a contract for an \"executor\" and an evemail with the will instructions being mailed to that person. if left untouched for say 2 weeks it passes to the next \"executor\" and so on... this idea could be greatly expanded on however it is one way that ccp can recover excessive game isk... by attrition..."
"ill have to think about a few ways of exploiting this.... which i see at least two at the moment, but, interesting idea nonetheless."
"that kind of depends on how much they are representing the posting public i guess"
"the it in charge of the chair should not be able to move topics. thats what posting would do. you post in a topic it goes to the top. my problem with this is that the forums that ccp uses are outdated and awful. if they updated to something decent and had a voting option on it they could vote in the thread for the issue and have it public so people can see what they voted. this would mean things could be done without having to have a chat meeting every week and if they did the chat meeting it could be about discussions that are not in threads or real time discussion about a topic in a thread."
"subtraction too hard?"
"my account -> \"subscription details\" it too complicated?"
"decent idea, doesn't need to be a countdown though. all you need is a line on the character selection screen saying\"subscribed till:- dd/mm/yyyy\"or\"subscribed till:- mm/dd/yyyy\"depending on date format chosen by the user.just a simple visual reminder on login, nothing too complex."
"can be coded by avarage programmer in 1 hour"
"yeah, ok i know that it is there, but apart from paying for my accounts i hardly visit these forums. and i don't think many people do."
"this is one of my first topics raised so here go's why should we include custom paintwe should include cutom paint because it could give the chance for the large corps and alliances to have a look that makes it easyer to identify them when the warp in. pirate corps could use them to strike fear into there prey, while large well known corps could use it in the same way a fleet does, to advertise there power and respect.should corps and alliances be able to protect there custom scheme.yes, this is to stop players who are not a member of that corp to 'steal' there paint job and pose as another corp. to prevent annoyance when you create your own, only to discover that its is aready being used, a list should be avalible on what schemes are in use and who owns it.should npc paint work be avalible for use.yes, but under certain circumstances. i propose that npc paint work should only be avalible to those who have a high enough standing with that corp, e.g a standing of 2 with the caldari navy grants you the right to use the paint work.for those in fw each milita should have its own paint work that is made avalible to the player upon joining that milita.if you support this idea click support if there is anything that you feel could improve this idea please dont hesitate to suggest it."
"while a possibly interesting suggestion, i think you should discuss possible negative effects (like lag) in your proposal."
"similar thread already underway:"
"it wont effect lag . lag is server side - models are renedered client side."
"setting aside wether the cms is a failure or not, i'd rather wait ta little longer before dismissing it completley i would like to point out that seeing as 80% of the eve population consists of empire dwelling carebears doesnt it make sense therfore that 80% of an elected democratic body representing the playerbase is carebear? i've never understood why 0.0 pllyares are so full of themseleves that they see themselves as superior and more important than the overwhealming majority of non 0.0 players."
"because 0.0 is filled with narcissistic sycophants, with a side order of sociopathy. not all of them are bad, some of them are regular joes, and fun to talk to. but only people with too much free time, and a yin for having their opinion vilified.. no matter how right-minded they think it is.. post on forums. of which we're all part of that last group."
"to moderate the meetings, the company hired agust h. ingthorsson, director of the research liaison office at the university of iceland and a professional moderator with experience in the halls of european power in brussels. he seemed to come away impressed.i have to tell you that i have been involved in e.u. meetings where the participants were not as prepared and professional as what weve seen here, he said, referring to the european union. these players have approached this meeting with what seems like real understanding of their roles. they are not just fighting for their particular interests but seem to be very socially responsible in wanting to represent all the players of eve. perhaps some real-world politicians could learn from them."
"it would be nice to have additiona licon if you have killrights on someone/ and someone on you. additiona lbackground colors would be nice too."
"tbh, anything like this would be amazing, since mining has not gotten any love for a very, very long time. personally, i'm a big fan of the idea that nyphur had a while back, (here) but all of these are entirely different from that, and are entirely new. some of these ideas break away from traditional mining, which is awesome. a combination of nyphur's for modifying traditional mining, and this, for adding entirely new content, would be absolutely amazing. however, i would like to note that i don't like the multi-ore asteroids idea. i like being able to choose what i mine, and i perfer nyphur's idea for removal of static belts over yours. however, you both were going in the right direction, so kudos for that.also, i would like to give a big laugh at the macrominers, since they would have to modify their macros in highsec to avoid the near-worthless 5% arkonor. also, i don't think that any mercoxit in high or low sec would be good. keep it in 0.0.in short, yes."
"i support the expansion of mining.however; i would not like to see static belt locations done away with entirely. maybe simply adding more variety to them would be more interesting. (example; they don't all have to be half-moon/circle shaped and at the same height {y?} axis point.)"
"definitely support more things for mining. just dont take away."
"just wanting to point out, we do have this thread here:"
"bunch of people think the helios with an imicus hull is ugly. ccp prolly wont change it back or stick somthing new on so black maybe only change they will make. doesn't look so bad as a black ship."
"well, i think it is a good start for csm, lets see where it leads us."
"i"
"so i was listening to eve radio and hear you guys talking about new ideas like different 0.0 endgame.where stationary 0.0 dwelling might be bypassed with the ability to have mobile stations of sorts. i'm indifferent, fine with me. but it seems the csm people are for this.but i'm now remembering the discussion about an exploration ship that can both explore as well as tank and gank the exploration sites. right now you need at least 2 ships. and i believe.. you csm people called the request \"lazy\"?jeez... hows about opening those big minds of yours and being considerate to the rest of eve? you're for new styles of play that you're interested in, but against solo exploration as a viable playstyle..whats more ironic is that i believe jade used \"space vikings\" as a description for a mobile station, to give the idea of a nomad space society.what about solo explorers, having to park our cov-ops, then go pick up our pilgrims (however ****ing many jumps away they are) and then go complete the site. hows that for a tether?alls we want is a combat recon cruiser with a large cargohold and bonus to exploration probe times. is that too freaking much to ask for? im sure it would ruin eve."
"everyone has their own opinions, both in game and out of game. who cares if any particular board member has in-game issues with another board member, or their corporation? as long as they are capable and willing to look past their in-game political affluences to achieve the greater good for all of the eve players, i have no issue.did you guys mention the pilgrim to the dev's? do they know this ship exists? lolps: goons suck."
"jade constant-fail"
"disclaimer: i do not disapprove of anyone having opinions. god knows i have my own thoughts on bob. i do however object to letting opinions impact the job one is supposed to do.for one, i agree that this issue is a serious one. for a simple reason:the csm is supposed to benefit the whole of eve. if a csm member deems it right to ignore the concerns of eve players not based on the merit of the concerns, but on who they are, then they are quite simply failing utterly at what they're supposed to do and have no business in such a position. (\"speaking personally i've got absolutely no interest answering goonie concerns or questions at this point in the process.\")however, as this thread is quite old now, and jade has actually been forced to meet goons, the big question is: has your opinion changed jade? are you now willing to act along the lines you are supposed to or do you still think letting prejudice rule over reason is fine?"
"that's another horrible analogy. what the analogy should be is....do you think that ban ki-moon (the current secretary-general of the un), uses his position to attempt to bring these different sides together in an attempt to help, or does he use this position to ignore others and push his personal agenda? what's more important is that jade's \"chair\" will only exist for so long, but we can keep putting goons in the csm until we all go play another game."
"well, i think it is a good start for csm, lets see where it leads us."
"i"
"i am not sure how this interview surprised anyone?all it is, is validation of the attitude we already knew ccp had. people have been screaming for fixes to the game for years, yet we still get stuff like faction warfare shoved down our throat.from the top down, ccp has no concept of fixing what's broken. from their ceo to their designers, they honestly think focusing on the \"big picture\" and continuing to build on a buggy and broken foundation is going to get them a winner in the end.really, when you think about it, the lag issue is a microcosm of what ccp is about. people have been complaining about the lag issues for a while, and rather than take the straight forward approach to fixing it (rebuilding eve to have a proper network engine), they feed us grand plans about infiniband and clearing space trash. they ignore the fact that none of it will matter if the very core of the networking engine isn't fixed.at some point you just throw up your hands and go \"welp\" because it's obvious ccp isn't listening."
"fixed."
"having experience with how to be interviewed for a large corp i must say that this was a pretty crappy interview.i'm disappointed the first response was 'wow, what a stupid thing to bring up' vs 'wow, we didn't know how badly the ui bothered our player base'considering that it was brought up as an issue might say 'oh, this is hosed maybe we should fix it quick because that's easy' vs 'you dumb customers, you brought up something simple'it's not simple to a lot of us. if you feel it is simple, and don't want to work on it, that's fine. don't insult your player base by calling them stupid for bringing something up though."
"that interview with hammerhead was :psyduck: .the obvious question of why ccp thought the csm would bring grand design to them arises - were ccp not paying attention to what the csm were doing? or did they not notice that the bulk of their efforts so far are focused on fixing and balancing?on the other hand, it was ludicrous to see hammerhead extol the virtues of transparency in a game with little to no documentation from the makers. every piece of documentation i use is player-made. this game has been going for years now - what's the hold up, ambulation, jovians? hell, everyone already knows about the variety of answers you can get from different gms on the same question.what is so hard about planning, coding and releasing a patch that fixes, say, the 25 most annoying things in this game? (yers, apart from lag) how long should that take? i don't see any player whining \"what, no new content? aahhhgrhrhrhghghfsdja!!!!!!\" i buy a car, i expect it to work. if not, i bring it back and get one that works properly. to my mind, the player base is far too accepting of all the niggly irritations when they should be dealt with."
"problem is, even with all of the bugs and issues, it takes a lot to make someone ragequit. every one of us has had frustrations with the game \"working as ccp intended (tm) but not up to player expectations\". but this is balanced by the times when the game has worked well enough that the shiny, awesome creation it can be has come through. we keep on playing, hoping that we will see the shiny again, and it comes along often enough to keep us hooked.add into this the documented addictive nature of this kind of game (i have experienced this myself with everquest as well as seen it in others with wow) and i can understand why the developers are lazy to do anything to fix the little things. simply... they don't need to, because saps that we are, we keep on playing anyway.edit - and it doesn't help when the interviewee plainly knows this and quite arrogantly says there's no need to work on the small things... and helps it even less when the interviewer is such a suck up that he may as well be on ccp's payroll."
"i always assumed that eve tv was closed because the people on it were egotistical morons who ran it like a joke."
"because it (abolish learning skills) is on the goonswarm wish list. you can also see the trend of this wish expressed in bane glorius's suggestion of reducing the time it takes to learn the skills for capital ships. the trend is: goonswarm would like to significantly reduce the training times in eve and by doing so reduce the advantage of older players over younger players.....oh and incidentally make the goonswarm alliance that much more powerful that much more quickly.there are two ways an issue may be brought up for an escalation vote in a csm meeting. one; it can get more than 40 approval (thumbs up) posts in a thread in the assembly area of the csm forums. or two; it can be taken up by a member of the csm who finds it worthy regardless of how many approval posts were made or lack thereof.if the majority of csm representatives vote to escalate the issue, then it is assigned an \"owner\" and presented to ccp by the owner at a csm/ccp meeting. because the minutes from csm meetings #4 and #5 have yet to be posted by ccp or serenity it's difficult to see the exact method used to get this issue on the agenda for the ccp meeting. however, as bane is the \"owner\" of the issue, it seems likely that he brought the issue to the csm meeting and asked for a vote to escalate. bane has said goonswarm depends upon new players and he feels these new players he sees are turned away by having to take the time to train the learning skills. further he feels it's virtually a requirement to train learning skills to high levels. thus he seeks to eliminate learning skills.you can see from the posts on the topic and from speaking to other players in eve that goonswarms view is not shared by most of eve, but it nevertheless made it to the ccp meeting. can't wait to see those csm meeting minutes posted as well as the csm/ccp meeting minutes.windjammer"

"/signedthe current \"oh why look at that funny needle in a bubble with thingys floating around it apparently teleporting minerals/materaials/ships between each other\" system, i mean it's a universe thousands of years into the future, i think ppl in that world could build somewhat nicer more logical looking things then the current pos'es"
"yes. market browser, chat windows etc are such a pain. if i could shove em off onto another monitor, it'd be nice."
"hell yes."
"agreed--not just 2 but multi monitor (or accessory displays)give me the space/\"standard view on one monitor and map/market etc on the other."
"it is difficult for me to give emphatic support as i have never flown a combat capital of any stripe. however, i have chosen not to partially because of the issues with the minnie capitals, particularly the nagl, that i have read about and verified as best as i can through eft/quickfit/spreadsheets. as such, i certainly support a review and likely some level of boost. in particular the pressing need to use fitting modules make \"standard\" fittings work should be addressed.otoh from a lore perspective i think that the minmatar capitals should remain weaker overall. the minmatar have only been free of the amarr for 125 years now, and as such all of our ship designs are at most a couple of centuries old. by contrast the other races have been working on their ship designs for millenia; for example khanid hijacked an amarr titan 600 years ago, almost half a millenia before we gained our freedom. while our engineers may be just as good and knowledgeable, we still have to catch up on refining our designs/design principles. additionally our racial \"trademark\" tactics are hit-and-run rather than giant sieges. this is supported in-game by the excellent smaller ships. it would not be supported by having excellent massive sit-and-siege ships. thus i would mostly support an incremental rather than a substantial improvement.in fact while it is far too late for such a drastic change, i think that the existing minmatar dread is completely out of line with our war philosophy and experience. i would have thought that it should be small and agile, perhaps having only two turrets and no missiles. it should make up for what it loses in siege damage by being far more capable at dealing with smaller ships (supplanting the moros in this primacy), with substantially better locking and align times, possibly tracking bonuses, and a reduced siege cycle time (with reduced strontium use per cycle so that the strontium/time remains constant) so that they can cut and run far more easily. something of that sort would make sense for the kind of war we fought against the amarr for freedom, and continue to fight now.that latter might still be an option for making the nagl more viable without changing the unenviable split bonuses and slot issues: give it a 50% drop in cycle length and a proportional 50% drop in strontium use per cycle. it would cost the same per unit time to siege and the cycles would remain calibrated with the rest of the fleet, but it would give the nagl more of the hit-and-run style while also allowing more chances to break out of siege mode to get remote repped. this would alleviate some of the issues with getting called primary, while being a bit in tune with the minmatar racial flavor. someone might even get some mileage out of an all-nagl fast strike fleet. it's just a thought - i don't mean to hijack the thread with too many left-field ideas. ;)"
"you bring up good points. however, look at the maelstrom and the hurricane. we are making advances. and the nag is simply a much larger typhoon, whereas the phoon requires twice or arguably three times the skills required to make it as effective as other race bs, the nag also requires twice the weapons training of other bs, and is still subpar. i'm going to keep saying this: why is it assumed minmatar players have to train more skills to be competitive??"
"i don't understand your \"gaming the system\" logic. there are very few individual skill trainings that take much more than a month. the vast majority of them take much less. so in order to get the same training as an active player, the inactive player must resubcribe periodically to switch out skills, paying practically as much as the active player. only the inactive player gets much less from the game overall. they get no isk, few or no material assets, and no standing increases. i don't really see anything wrong with that situation."
"i'm against this. the thing which has kept me (and my multiple accounts) as a subscriber has been the ability to trail behind everyone else during the rough months.sure you can train up battleship v etc, but so what? i can understand the rp thing, but sp affects only me. even those who (full disclosure: i've tried to do this) try and cheat the system via alt training have to go through a lot of pain to do it. getting all the timing right and stuff, just not worth it.players trying to get ahead using this method are paying for more resources while using less. it reminds me of the isp model. under that model, you'd be the p2p user (i assume that because you're a trader, you constantly refresh market, make changes to the db, query the db etc to stay ahead?) while those guys are the \"sure i'll pay for broadband then use it only for email and im\". eve gets to keep some players around which it otherwise wouldnt and ccp has more income for infrastructure.using this method i've trained covert ops v, battleships v, and maybe some learning skills to v. doesn't mean i can just come back and buy a battleship or covert op. doesn't mean i have any experience or skill with the ship. if your proposal came to pass, guys like me would be sitting at 4mil if we even hung around. depressed that yesterday's dread is today's cruiser. as long as resources do not accumulate, the player has very few advantages. so he saved a few irl dollars..who cares? isn't that what power^2 is anyway?i suggest the following alteration:disable rp accumulationdisable all market orders"
"i was going on and reading, and nodding, and agreeing with the post made by vuxacha, and then the quoted text came into view... at the moment i am having an interesting sensation in my left arm, i think its a heart attack....."
"you know for each of those characters you want to farm data cores with you need 100m in skill and a lvl5 standing to the corp you want the cores from, offen 2 corps. if you want good data cores on all agents.and this is alot of work, to setup, to make good money from it. so if someone whants to do this, then good on em, anyone can do it, so since you cant afford or have the time or what ever to do it, dont mean it should be nerfed.,"
"lol, don't panic. i was just goading shar cos he is a trader and i suspect that he must have at least 1 account he pays for with isk (something considered highly unfair in most mmos). that was gonna be my opening, but after seeing how well this forum operates i guess its not nice to troll.even if some ....person guy.... is suggesting a change that would throw me out of the game, as well as the hundreds of interesting adults i've met here. i've never played a game with so many vets and 20+yos. i suspect that the light pressure for skill 'levelling' and the single node (so you never come back to find everyone has switched servers/sides) environment are the reason.i also do not like the fact that it appears the csm will be used for the purpose of people grabbing their pitch forks and going on their own vendettas, or simply trying to buff their own selves up.=( i left some market orders up before i left last. ouch. remember how much trit used to cost? yeh...."
"nothis is part of eve's uniqueness and something that makes the game attractive to players who may wish to quit paying yet come back later.bad idea."
"why should ccp support the interests of people who aren't paying at the expense of those who are?eliminating absentee skill training would set the stage for skill training ques. something most active players would like to see. if ccp were to institute a skill que under current conditions, absentee players would be able to set up long que's and train without paying for months. this is and would playing for free.accumulating research points to purchase datacores while absent from eve and not paying is just nuts. it's like setting a mining script to run while you take off for months. ccp is against scripted (afk) mining or farming so why should they continue to allow the accumulation of resources by someone who isn't even paying to be active. when these resources hit the market place they impact the economy and affect active player's who are paying.want to play? then pay.regards,windjammer"
"hi all,here is the excuse for ccp to take down rp and sp on inactive accounts. i am sure that they will take note from this nice topic that will let they earn more money but will not even try to read anything about the topic related to 30, 60 and 90 days gtc. since it would hurt their income.so keep with those things to make eve a more efficient machine to earn money, ccp will love u all.one thing, this kind of training is not an abuse, it's just the way it was designed. it's like the rules of conduct or the procedure to setup a pos in space. everyone knows how to do it and accept it, the bad thing comes once someone decides to change it hurting people that likes this rule.i like this game and i like the offline training. it's is one of the reasons because of i play it. why dont u use your time playing and not giving ccp excuses to earn more money?.have fun in eve-crash-register-online."
"hello,a few things.did u ever raised a topic related to this matter to take note of the common thoughts of the people before using your privileged position?do u use your privileged position often in your rl to achieve personal enhancements or to impose your own ideas?thankx."
"why is it mutually exclusive? you could easily control the rules of the queue to prevent abuse. to set up long trains to take advantage of the current situation, you have to spend a bunch of time preparing some big vs (with learning and implants, there arent many). it a huge pain in the neck. if you're unable to afford your account every month you can do it, but it doesn't do more than save a few dollars. everyone else will continue to train and earn isk.i mentioned in my last post that people like that support the habits of the power gamers, because they pay to setup their long trains and probably use almost no server resources to do so. the benefits do not end there. these people are spending isk (buying skillbooks etc) whilst earning almost nothing. that means they're also acting as isk sinks.this would be a change that would cause an exodus from eve. how does that benefit us? there'd be no lag reduction because they're already not using resources. my sp wouldn't suddenly be worth more by even a measurable fraction, because most trains are not big ass v trains. they're medium ass v.i still agree with the removal of rp accumulation, however, i've already mentioned in this thread that market orders persist. in addition to that, share dividends continue to go out.passive progression would be so hard to stamp out. meanwhile games like wow give rested status to characters, a feature that earlier mmos didn't possess. why? because penalising people for not playing is not the same as encouraging them to play."
"no, bad idea. not supported.this is within the game rules and there's nothing illegal about it. what people do with their accounts in none of your business. no one is preventing you from doing the same thing. it's not abuse. it's taking advantage of your options.the people who use the time during account inactivity to research stuff will off course use that to get isk or rp, but that's good. these people will flood the game with cheaper, abundant bpos, bpcs, items and ships. this will in turn drive prices down on stuff, and maybe even somehow drive the prices down on characters, and time cards.given the recent time card price hikes, some people need every available resource at hand to be able to make enough isk every two months. this is just one more way to do so. me and many other people have been asking ccp for a long time now, to give us an option of an extended skill queue so that we can continue training skills when we are away. we ask this, because we are unable to renew our subscription as often as we used to, so at least we should have the option to keep training our skills/researching stuff. off course there are people who have other reasons to ask for this new option, but either way this is an important issue.then you come along and ask that even our existing option to finish our skill in training after account expires be removed... you gotta be joking...but don't worry. ccp wont listen to you. they need people like me to keep playing the game even if i don't renew my subscription as often as i used to. it's still money to them, even if it's less money. therefore, i'm sure they will at least keep the existing options, if not give us the extended queue.look man.. i respect you. you helped me when i was a total newb, and you were nice to me. i will always remember that. i also respect your opinion, and in some small way you could be right from where you stand. but please leave this issue alone. consider how this would impact other people who play this game \"on the budget\". who are you to tell them, they can no longer do so?"
"i am happy to announce the great achievements that ccp has made with my subscriptions.1 year ago i was a 5 accounts player, 2 mains ones and 3 alters raising skills focused in capital ships.then our friend ccp zulupark had the nice idea of nerfing the carriers because they should be used in another way. well, in my opinion it was just a real bad thing since as in any contract u cant sell a house with 4 rooms and 300 m2 in total and after 3 months say that the rooms are just 1 and 30 m2.another nice idea of zulupark was lowering the unused explosive resistance of shields in a called un-nerfing patch. how ironic.my alters lost a lot of their capabilities and all the isk i spent in skills and gtc for their creation gone into a total waste of time.i havent acivated those 3 accounts since dec 2007.then here they are again with another great idea (i suppose from the nice mind of zulupark). let<U+FFFD>s increase de income from the game and lower the number of connections since the game is saturated. how can we do it without telling what do we want to do?.here is the answer, since many europeans are used to buy gtc in dolars to get the benefit from the dolar euro exchange, let's change the gtc system and let's see what we get.- let's get global benefit raising the base price of gtc. from 14,95 30 days = 0,5 cents/day, 39,95 90 days = 0,45 cents/day to a nice 34,95 60 days = 0,5825 cents/day. wow, great idea 30% extra income than using 90 days gtc.- also if people wants to try do offline training they needed 6 * 30 days gtc aprox each year, now they will need 4 * 60 days aprox. it means 14,95*6= 89.7 and now they will need 34.95*4=139.8. wow 50 dolars more each year.- ooo, remember all this people using gtc to get the benefit from dolar-euro exchange, this change will make the price the a gtc subscription way worse than just paying directly 1 year of credit card subscription.they are basically forcing us to pay more for each account we have even if we use it or if we try to do offline training.i think that the next step will be not allow offline training, once your account runs out of time they will stop your training.well, atm i am just using 1 account and it will run out tomorrow, with the current price of gtc in isk i have to spent way more time now to pay my next gtc and with every move done by ccp it gets worse.\"\"\" this is just a way for earning more money \"\"\"well, i keep thinking that they will not answer us, they will just keep laughing at our faces.have fun."
"err, they already did answer us. they said their previous explanation of why the cards were changed was really marketing bs, they failed to mention that their new explanation is also marketing bs though."
"i dont feel confortable with any answer comming from csm atm. the decission comes from ccp and csm is just a filter for problems installed by ccp. if they dont want to answer anything, they can just make csm answer for them without having to face the problem directly. my total support to csm task in any way.i think that in the same way that happened to me with my carrier alters not being reactivated since the carrier nerf, eve have suffered a reduction on its active alter account amount, hurting the income of company. it can be shown past months prices of gtc for isk. i was allowed to buy a 90 days gtc for 325 mil.the main interest of ccp is to increase the income by:- solve the reduction of income because of many people not training anymore their alters.- making euro people pay in euros.- making all people pay more.- lower the ammount of posible people online so their servers dont go obsolete so fast.about their \"premium\" comment about this game, i have to say that it's very good, even more if u are an old player who has worked hard to achieve complex objetives; but the problem here is not if the game is good or bad they must say things directly, if u want to raise prices do it equal to everyone. let all people pay in euros or dolars without restrictions and call the things by its name \"price increase\".i am sure that the next step is going to be the stop rp & sp once an account is deactivated, since it will mean around a 50% extra income from every alter account.have fun in eve-crash-register-online."
"*sigh*no!!!some alliances are massive and thus would easily sway the faction warfare easily.they have 0.0 for that.this is to help encourage players who have not really pvped before to try it on a small scale. if they wanted to get ultra-blobbed trying to pvp they would go to 0.0 and do it that way."
"just for the record: blobbing is as common in fw as in 0.0 - and why shouldn't it be as it is the easiest 'strategy' (blobsize may be smaller with 'only' 50-100 ships). add in the numbers disparity and you'll see why balance is skewed. but that's a different story :p"
"having read about the disgusting t20 affair, i believe he should be allowed to return to the game.all he really did was to expose just how vile ccp really are - in spite of the fact that eve is a great game."
"*sighs*simply put, it isn't going to happen fullstop.if it even got past this stage of tossing varied arguments back and forth with bits of info that no one can officially verify csm would probably have fun discussing it for a long time, then there's the possibility that ccp will turn around and say player punishment and revoking it is outside of the realm of the csm's mandate.if it ever went through the csm and ccp would then have to deal with a whole host of banned players wanting specific accounts back pretty much swamping the csm with hundreds of topics like this and the csm will have to consider each one individually otherwise they'd look like they'd expressed favouritism destroying any respect the community has for them rendering their function useless as a representative of the community.if people want to bring up the issue that other specific players should have also been banned but they weren't while kug was, then the issue they should be raising with the csm is why haven't those players been banned."
"so they should ban any character that out gm's? if that is your policy there was an incident where a person outed a gm in public and no action was taken - should the rule also apply to that character?as to the issue stated in the forum - ccp has a process and method to get bans investigated and lifted - just because you don't like the result doesn't mean the process is broken.as long as the rules are applied equally i don't see a problem with them - when they are arbitrarily applied there is an issue.it's been so long i don't remember what specifically the ban was for, i do remember reading that all official channels were exhausted at that time."
"free kugu"
"i for one would not support the unbanning of **********.while initially he did a needed job, whistleblowing the misconduct of certain ccp employees, he followed that up by a series of essentially malicious attacks on innocent members of ccp staff.regardless of the circumstances this was unwarranted and ccp have a right and duty to protect the interests of their employees and the company from the player base. had ********** managed to keep his behaviour in check and truely been a 'martyred innocent' this would be a very different situation. as it was ********** attempted to start a vendetta against ccp in general, far beyond what was required to whistleblow.you could argue the rights and wrongs of boths sides - ccp's general mishandling, kugu's 'illegal' actions, etc... but it basically comes down to kugu's intention to harm ccp. ccp have no moral or legal obligation to unban him, regardless of whatever indirect positive concequences his actions may have had."
"and i quote from kieron (ccp dev)\"the devs have stated on a number of occasions the reasoning behind the decision to not introduce a skill queue system and a web-based interface for skill selection. mostly, it centers around this being a game we want you to play, not a web-based competition centered around who can get to 100 million skill points the fastest.there are work arounds for time constraints under the existing system. set a short skill for the times when you are playing, a longer skill for the times when you are not available.we are having a difficult enough time enforcing the issues caused by isk and item sellers, let alone players selling characters on ebay. we are not going to introduce another game mechanic that will allow 'character farmers' an easier time with their trade.\"so get over it. this is not going to happen. set a schedule and stop being lazy."
"oh my god, they finally got down their high horse!!!! this is the best eve related news i've read on the last 3 months.thanks to the csm for bringing it up to ccp's eyes"
"i support this. for the more casual gamers and people with rl commitments a (short) queue would be immensely useful. even a 24 hour skill queue limit would be excellent. enough to set one of those 5 hour skills going in an evening and then have it switch back to your long skill afterwards."
"i disagree, no skill queue for me. it's an unneeded luxury."
"not having to wake up to switch a skill that finishes at 3am? holy smokes, i'm game!"
"the best compromise is to not have skill que, but let the same skill continue training to the next level until it hits v. once it hits v then that's it.people will still then have to manually log in to change skills, but not have to worry about loosing time with regard to a specific skill."
"it is likely that i will soon be in the armed forces. and i don't see why my in game abilities should be nerfed cos of rl training and operations that will take me away from the game especially since i'll probably still be subscribing.btw this^^ is evidence that people exist who only think of themselves"
"support.i have similar situation. due to nature of my work i have to leave my country every now and then for a few month, and skill queue could make my life easier.i think i`m not the only person with such way of life/work, who is playing eve cause of it`s skill training system. it is better then in other mmo's, but it could be even better with skill queue.hm, is there any 3 months skill ? \"character farmers\" exist, and would exist no matter if there is any \"skill queue\" or not. it is a problem of every mmo. they can probably be traced, but, looks like it takes to much time/effort to do it.typical point of view for a person who have internet access most of time, no matter at work or at home."
"posted 2 times by mistake, sorry. please remove this post."
"that statement was made before the idea of a dual-training/limited skill-queue was on the drawing-board - get your facts right !!!and we are talking about a skill-queue of one skill - not infinite queueing !"
"fw needs it own forums space, too much idiots posting on caod!i support it."
"yes yes fw needs it own."
"agreed, while kovid makes some valid points about the other forumsm they are just too tainted in the eyes of many playerscaod= goon/bob crap most players in fw don't give a flying donkey about what the 0.0 people are doing to each other. the other summits are rp only and while that is nice, the fw topics cover a lot of non rp topics and therefore are \"not welcome\" there, and the rp'rs are already defensive about people playing in their pool.and some non rp people don't want to hear rp arguements/ whatever when they want to discuss game mechanics. that said making corporations and alliances summit to corporations, alliances, and militia summit and remove the inc character/rp restriction would do it. barring that fw needs its own sections."
"*attempts to read through the entire thread...but gets a headache so just votes after avoiding repeating points over and over and over again.*"
"so named items should universaly melto to 10 trit and plain t1 should not drop from rats :-)"
"i wish i had 4 hands so i could give this thread 4 thumbs up!"
"that would be a start... but then again, bounties and salvage alone, and you're still better off running l4s in highsec than mining in highsec (or lowsec, for that matter).you need to bring down potential highsec mission-running income to the same level as mining in order to see any actual benefits."
"or increase the risk to make the reward truly level with the current growth pattern."
"change how sovernty worksand the mineral voucher idea has merit."
"missions are riskier than mining, and thus by your own standards they should have higher rewards. also, given that there seem to be quite a lot of people willing to mine in high-sec, i won't say the profession is being driven out of business just yet. also, on a completely different note, i've come up with a potential solution to lowsec mining that isn't one of these ludicrously expansive proposals to tear the game a new space-hole. how about we just seed some non-****ty ores? we've got 6 highsec ores, 6 0.0 ores(not counting mercoxit), but only 3 lowsec ores, so here's 3 more. all of them are 500 units to refine and 2 m3 per unit, just to make the numbers simple. ore #1: 15000 trit, 1000 mex, 300 iso, 100 nocx, 10 mega - 133 isk/m3 at market prices, 233 at baseore #2: 3000 trit, 2500 pyer, 2000 mex, 20 mega - 143 isk/m3 at market prices, 254 at baseore #3: 500 trit, 500 pyer, 500 iso, 200 nocx, 40 zyd - 147 isk/m3 at market prices, 253 at basefor comparison, the best highsec ore is 90 at market and 156 at base, and the worst 0.0 ore is 130 at market and 199 at base, with current lowsec ores being 60-100 market and 168-225 base. this also puts a tiny amount of megacyte into lowsec, which means that empire can actually source all seven of the minerals, albeit in vanishingly small quantities for zyd and mega."
"well, tell that to somebody who didn't lose a single ship to mission npcs in a really, really long time due to the fact they can't even come close to breaking its tank (and that in a relatively cheap ship)... or compare that to a miner tanking any npc spawns at a certain level.higher-level missions (heck, even most l3 missions, not just all l4s) need to become significantly more dangerous if you want to have them at a relatively fair \"risk-vs-reward\" balance with mining.it's not about them being completely out of bussiness, it's about ratios of people doing one thing vs the other thing. when an overwhelming amount of income in highsec comes out of mission-running, you know you have a problem.that sounds like a reasonable alternative. your presented approach is just a small derivate of the \"change ore make-up\" idea.but yes, the idea of adding 3 lowsec-only ore types is quite nice - gives a lot more \"play room\".although you might want to tweak the contents a bit, like, say, include almost as much tritanium per cubic meter in all those ores than you find in veldspar, on top of traces of highends and some lowends, for starters.so, let's say, 40k, 30k and 20k tritanium in ores 1,2 and 3, with much less mid-ends and slightly less highends in each.ore 1 will then become something akin to \"heavily enriched veldspar\" (33% more trit than veld on top of a trace of other things) - automatically at least 33% more valuable than veld in actual market value plus the trace stuff - but make it so that base value is around 160 tops.ore 2 will be \"veldspar with other stuff\" (same amount of trit per cubic meter like veld, plus a mix of others) - roughly same market value as veld plus whatever comes from the added mid/highends, make that around 175 base value.ore 3 will be \"lesser veldspar with some valuables\" (33% less trit than veld, but more of the supposedly \"valuable\" stuff) - make that almost 200 in base value.in actual market value (at current prices), they should be almost equally valuable, even if their base value differ.that, plus adding a healthy serving of tritanium to spodumain and arkonor (while removing some mid/high-ends) should do the trick quite nicely.___like i say and keep saying, i really don't care which approach is picked, i only care about the issue being brought in the \"high priority\" queue and solved (in any way) as soon as possible."
"yes, i'll agree that competent missioners don't lose ships very often. but that's because they tend to devote almost all of their mid, low, and rig slots to not dying, and they're careful with their aggro control. and even then, an inconvenient disconnect or a stupid drone that draws aggro can still get you killed. it's like saying lions aren't dangerous in zoos - they still are, we've just got very good bars in the way. personally, i'd wager that the ratios would be similar even if their expected profit was the same - missioning is just more fun for most people. actually, \"veld but better\" was exactly what i was trying to avoid. i don't want to see any ore obsoleted, and veld's role as fast trit is one i don't object to. also, lowsec should be focused primarily on mid-range ores - my ore #1 is probably too skewed to high and low for my tastes, but yours are just excessive. of course, we're quibbling at this point, and i know we agree in principle on the suggestion of better lowsec ores. as for \"high priority\", i still have to differ. this is one of many structural issues, and it's not the biggest. fw is the lowsec boost du jour, we can hold off a couple months on the next one."
"most just log before concord even show up now. no loss at all.it's pretty stellar."
"news flash, op is not wanting high sec ganks to stop, just for there to be \"risk\" in the \"risk vs. reward\" part of the game.thank you and go learn to read."
"sorry but high sec missions completely destroy the concept of risk/reward in this game."
"pretty much"
"it's a good thing concord can't find safespots or anything. owait...."
"exactly, just wait.24hrs to be precise."
"i can read fine and i'm not debating what the op wants i'm simply pointing out how easy it is to counter suicide ganking.also i stand by my comments of some people being to greedy to want to try and work together to stop it because it interrupts their isk flow, that or their being to lazy or stupid to work out how."
"no risk to the reward? kill rights? i risk hauling afk with kill rights on me because i know people i've killed are too gutless or stupid to come get me. that and it'd throw their isk/hour ratio right off which is just sacrilege to these mission runners :o.nerf is not an option there are already many effective counters."
"dont stop it, just make it less profitable.-any ship destroyed by concord should only be paid pack what was paid to scc. in essence a refund. not full payout.-any ship that is self-destructed should have the same result as above."
"it's almost as if you missed the sarcasm, so i'll spell it out. concord doesn't give a hoot if you log out before they show up, they will find you, because you will have a 15 minute agression timer and will remain in space long enough for them to leisurely find your e-warp spot and destroy your ship. logging off will not save your ship. thanks for playing."
"there should not be a magic missile that can kill any speed tank just as there should not be a magic anti-armour or anti-shield missile.pve:i don't see a big issue here because i use drones to kill the frigs while my t1 missiles take out the big boats. i don't see the point in using t2 or faction missiles in a mission situation where you are trying to make isk not spend it.i do understand that there is a nice feeling of 'i win' about using the best gear you can especially if mission running is what you do in eve and so there may be an issue here for some people however nerfing the entire minmatar speed strategy is not the answer.pvp:it should be remembered that the speed tank is one of the most inteligent tactics in this game, it involves piloting your ship so that you are never flying directly towards a turret and the entire minmatar syrategy is built on this so if you introduce missiles that can hit any fast moving target you will nerf an entire faction. any uber precision missile should have some kind of directional drawback so that a smart pilot can avoid it but a nanogank who knows nothing but orbit at 20k will soon fall foul.imo there should be a correlation between the size of missile and the size of nanoship:light precision missiles - able to kill a nanofrigheavy precision missiles - able to kill a nanocruisercruise precision missiles - able to kill a nano bsnanoships have already been nerfed so if we can't have directional missiles it may be wize to have a specific launcher for these missiles or even better read this thread for an intresting idea about giving af's a % powergrid reduction for assault launchers which would give them a specific antinano role:csm issues about af's"
"you'll notice that the table i listed for their changed values would be unable to hurt a vagabond at speed - they easily do 6kms. if that vagabond slows down to shoot - golly gee - it will get killed by any flavor of missile. this change prevents non-pimp nano-hacs from completley ignoring the entire line of cruiser sized missiles. believe it or not - far more ships are nanoed than just vagabonds. you say yourself you want precision heavies to kill nano-hacs... then what exactly, is the problem? also, what on earth are you going on about pve? the only person thats brought pve up in this thread is a troll."
"ignore the troll, i reply about pve because ccp need to think about carebears too, that 'i win' feeling from people who don't pvp or read these forums is their income. anyway carebears are cudly like ewoks agreed there is an issue here, my point is slightly different in that i want to see an inteligent piloting aspect rather than pure maths, either in the form of directional blasts or ship choice. eve chess should be more than 'to outrun missile x you need to do speed y' otherwise people will skill up to the point where they outrun the missile regardless of how fast it goes.giving the af a % pg bonus to assault launchers would give people a choice of flying a boat that could take down a nano bs or flying a cruiser to fill another role.should point out that i fly caldari ships a lot so see this from both sides however bringing this subject up with minmatar milita folk was, err, not positive."

"well first let me say: don't lose site of the big-picture vision because you disagree with some specific example i pulled out of my ass. it's up to the devs to decide how exactly to get us there, but this is the point:i would like to see the game mechanics push player toward frequent, cooperative, group-based pve activities for making \"the real isk\".but yes, making it easy to find worthwhile exploration encounters is probably a bad idea. but i still like my idea for group ratting. there have to be fun group-orientied isk-making things that people can do in 0.0 every time they log in (and conquerable 0.0 lacks missions)."
"resolution for more fleet missioningall the mmorpg-s i played had this implemented in some waythe simplest thing is a percentage increase in the value of a kill exp points, or here in eve bounty iskthe idea is something like... 10% more bounty for each player in fleetso 10 players doing a mission would get a total of double the bounty split up among them (or more if the percentage is stackable, bit that's down to fine tuning the idea)apply the same principle to isk and lp rewards from agents and you got a nice reason to do fleet missionsthere are problems with this idea tho:1. abuse prevention so people dont invite anyone into fleet to fill the 10 persons for max bonus2. balancing the missions where this rule can't be applyed (when there's no bounty for kills)"
"it is long past time to right this wrong.it was a huge mistake when the original 2-d system map window was banished to the f11 key and lower right hand corner of our screen. that map was and continues to be the most efficient tool to establish the relative direction and range between objects. combined with the directional scanner and the overview, it was/is the most powerful tool for any pilot....pvp or not. the f10 3-d system view is a poor and clumsy substitute for what was a functional and critical tool. not only is it time that the 2-d system map be returned to its own window, but ccp should also consider upgrading it a little. simple things like range markers similar to those in the tactical view would greatly enhance our abilities to quickly pull distance estimates from the graphic.as for the directional scanner, stations really need to be added back in as a scannable result. it made no sense to remove it from the directional scanner in the first place. it's the equivalent of removing star gates from the directional scanner. we gain nothing and lose everything by removing them."
"yep"

"agreed."
"you mention hawt drops like its a bad thing.... i personally dont think it is but, what if you had a mobile cynofield jammer, for simplicity give it to a hic, as like the bubble in the high slot, it might work. give it 249km effective area, when hic deploys anticynofield bubble, it can't be repped so that means friendlies must defend without repping, hawt droppin support gang must be in system to kill the hic with the anticyno bubble. at 250km, a tower could shoot at it so you couldn't just put one outside a tower as it will get shot at, or if you dont care about that, give it a longer range like 2000kmbiggest problem with a hawt drop is the lag it creates for everyone on grid, now if you like the 249km effective range, at least they are distance away or 2000km are off grid. its a ship that needs to be destroyed or defended, and i think would be a nice balance between the ability to use cap's, whatcha think?this will prevent idiots from throwing caps around blatantly as they can't just cyno in 20 of their friends if they get in trouble without dealing with support gangs first. if this were implimented hawt drops probably would be cut in half after the first 100 carriers would go down within a week"
"quote from the csm ...refrence:"
"i'm in agreeance with this guy ^. great ideas. however entirely to complex and huge for current game. they would basically have to re-write the entire game."
"/signed"
"yeah..."
"agreed that there is an issue of cross threading etc, but where does a heavily supported issue in 'features and ideas discussion' become and idea that the csm should be pushing for?perhaps there should be some formalish way of turning a features and ideas item into a csm [issue].also, it appears as though the csm boards are far more heavily read - it is quite understandable that players wanting an idea implimented will want to push their ideas in a visible place where they will get player, if not dev, support. if that isn't the intention for csm then more moderation is going to be needed to get that sorted."
"yes this is exactly what i expected would happen. there should be set rules when you can post an issue in assembly hall."
"by sheer volume of traffic, an idea will get more exposure in the assembly hall than it will in the features and ideas forum. i agree that some things seem to pretty obviously belong in one or the other, but there's also a lot of gray area, and any sort of effective segregation between the forums is going to require a large effort by moderators. at what point is the solution to an \"issue\" an \"idea,\" and how do people move whole discussions from one forum to the other without losing their audience? it's silly to have two separate forums for these discussions.it seems to me that features and ideas became (unintentionally) obsolete when the assembly hall was created. this is the venue through which players can voice suggestions to the devs in ways that can ultimately lead to implementation, and it gets more attention than features and ideas. i'd rather not see moderators engage in a futile effort to separate what are \"ideas and features\" from what are \"issues.\" that's a needless semantic debate at this point, and trying to separate it out would hinder rather than help discussion."
"ccp greyscale: the devs look at features and ideas discussion, and it's up to us to manage the assembly hall. can the csm create better guidelines for this forum?"
"in theory perhaps, but what actually looks to be happening is that a lot of people are just skipping the f&id stage and posting their initial suggestions in assembly hall in the hopes that a csm will jump on to support it."
"reason for this isn't too hard to see. which forum has more discussion, more readers, and more replies per topic? this forum has become not only a place to propose ideas and receive support, but also a better place to thrash out an idea than f&i simply because it gets more traffic.doesn't mean i like it or support it, just means it makes sense to me."
"agreed, this forum is the one that gets the traffic. i think this forum rendered features and ideas obsolete - detailed discussions are going to happen here anyway, so there's no point in trying to segregate the discussions into two separate forums. it would be nice to get some sort of official word from ccp on how they envision the features and ideas forum being used, in light of the creation of the assembly hall."
"its a similar pattern to what happened when games workshop opened their own official discussion forums on their website - every armchair rule designer migrated from the various unofficial forums to the gw site. the new forum became deluged with ideas from the gaming community hoping that a dev would adopt it (because the devs made the mistake of actually making the odd post and confirming they were actively reading) and incorporate their unit idea or tweak into the next ruleset, or even offer them a playtester position or (in the most deluded cases) a job.of course, 95% or more of the ideas posted were utterly terrible and the noise drowned out the signal to the extent where the forums shortly became useless, and were closed down again after a year or so. we're not at that stage here right now, but one can already see f&id going into a slight decline as people stop posting over there and migrate to assembly hall, because people are hoping a sympathetic csm will show up and fast-track their idea to ccp's attention, or are using the csm forums to make posts to use as a platform for a future csm bid of their own. we have three forums operating in parallel right now with all sorts of raw and half-baked ideas popping up in both assembly hall and jpsc apparently without having been discussed elsewhere, because nobody seems really sure where the remit of each particular forum begins and ends."
"heck, even csm themselves use this forum to thrash out ideas... stuff like that pretty much opened the floodgates for everyone else to use it as an idea discussion forum, instead of a forum on the merits of an idea and if it should go forward to ccp."
"you can't have a discussion on the merits of an idea without allowing alterations to the idea to make it have more merit in the eyes of some of the people discussing it. what the idea is and whether it has merit is one conversation, not two. if we're going to have these conversations at all, it should all be in the same place.ccp wanted the csm to act as interlocutors, and indeed they are. there are obviously bad ideas that get posted in the assembly hall, but not every crackpot idea makes it to ccp.i see a sort of natural selection process at work here - people are migrating to the assembly hall because csm can compel the devs to answer specific questions, and csm's recommendations carry more weight with ccp than individuals posting in the forums.these discussions on ideas and features and issues and merit are going to happen one way or another, and it makes more sense for them all to be in one place, because the distinctions between them aren't obvious enough that they could be enforced by anything but heavy-handed moderating, which would inhibit the conversation and take a lot of effort on the part of the moderators. at the moment, the assembly hall is the most logical place to have these discussions, since it gets the most traffic and has a built-in process that filters out non-starter ideas and brings popular ideas to the devs for implementation or comment."
"the way it should have been setup is that the \"features and idea discussions\" and \"game development\" threads carry on as per usual and the \"assembley hall\" is locked down with a account vote system.only cms members could start a thread in assembly hall which would outline a vote proposal. then players could only vote \"yes or no\" for that proposal but not post.if they want to respond to it then player go back to the original thread in the \"features and idea discussions\" and \"game development\"."
"to follow up on this, this issue did not officially make it to iceland. i did, however, manage to tell oveur, hammerhead, and some other guys about various complaints about large acs in general. not promising that they'll look at it, but hey, at least it's something."
"supported."
"no way, minmatar are allready way overpowerd. em/exp dam. +20% dam, no cap to fire. extreme falloff.ye right get real. they need a nerf if anything."
"eft dps numbers dont mean sh*t real world because we fight in falloff wich can be a drastic reduction in dps. get a clue people."
"the reason it didn't make it to iceland is beacuse less than half of the posts support it!just because you're csm does not mean your ideas get to be moved to the front of the list. wait in line like the rest of us."
"after reading this thread, and getting generally annoyed on these forums, i think that there should be more options around the filter. it appears to be that the main issue about having the filter on the forum and not ingame is that these forums can be searched by anyone on the internet and thus no age limit. this is not so ingame, where you need to have an account and it has an option to disable the filter. so, what i propose, is to have an option in the settings feature \"disable word filter\" - which would do the same thing it does ingame."
"posting support."
"removed. please do not bypass the profanity filter. navigator"
"maybe the word filter can be tweaked, but i really don't think allowing it to be disabled is a good idea. learn some new words to replace the filtered ones.plus, if the filter could be disabled, more people would post with profanity and the \"naughty\" words, so reading the forums with the filter active would cause some eye strain with the *** ***** ******** words appearing everywhere. imagine caod having even more naughty words laced with the trolling and the smack ."
"unlike the current fw outposts these can only be entered by one ship at a time from each faction so that there will be a 1 vs 1 situation, the winner gains fw points and the faction with the most heros at the end of each day gets a t2 lolipop.people could even pay to enter with the winner taking all."
"because i couldn't help but think it...two ships enter, one pod leaves!"
"1 - kestrel does more damage than a hawk.+1 - assault missile launchers are so slow noone uses them on a cruiser.=2 - give the af a % powergrid reduction for assault missile launchers.same applies for dual railblasterlasertypeshooty things.i love frigs but try as i may i can not find a role for my hawk. really i want it to be like a mini t1 cruiser which it is in every respect untill i try and shoot anything and then...well...um...er...all i can say is a rifter tanked my t2 rockets"
"the following topic is about precision missiles:linkageif you can't be arsed reading the above thread it says 'light missiles are the only ones that can hit a nano ship and there's some whining about not being able to take out drones with cruise missiles'.the above suggestion of an af with assault launchers would be the perfect antinano ship. finally, a role for the af edit:ok, i don't like this idea but someone else proposed an anti tackler role for the af: linkageaf's too heavy to intercept a tackler but too light to tank untill it reaches target imo but may as well get gome ideas into the af thread"
"just throwing this one out there. i read the interviews about csm and the devs say that they are very transparent which may be true but it sometimes feels like the transparency is but a flicker.i understand that devs are busy developing and i too would rather they do that than anything else. however, since we all do want updates, and frequent ones would be better, perhaps someone should be an active pr person who dishes out updates and communicates with us. some people have talked about the flaming such a person would get. well, the pr / devs can ignore those people and even mute them if necessary as long as those of us who are mature can get our updates. i do think that constant updates, even if they come in a list form of what is being worked out, what stage its at and how long till next stage (rough rough estimate) would soothe a lot of rage.so what do we think? a dedicated pr person or just take 5% of dev time and put it into updating us?"
"anything involving 100,000+ people is gonna be murky and i don't think the game would be half as much fun if we truly knew what was going on. ccp do a very good job of keeping us informed but the volume of info is such that you either have to dedicate your life to the game or live with being in the dark.the petition system is very efficent if you have a particular issue and the dev 'ccp wrangler' seems to get the flaming on the forums (not that my alt tartan pixie would have ever done such a thing ) so it's all in there already. +1 to ccp."
"last i knew, dev blogs were supposed to be weekly. we all see how well that works. a month or two of inactivity, followed by a one month dash of blogs before the newest release, and slowly going toward no activity again for about a month after that.this system seems to work though. so i'm not gunna knock it."
"the current system, where they talk to the players when there's something to talk about and get back to coding when there isn't is just fine by me. we don't need a dedicated pr guy, and it'd be a waste of ccp's money."
"i think its more than a little macabre to profit off of a rl death."
"i'm sure your ceo would be relieved to know that in the event of his real life death, his pretend internet spaceship guild will be transferred to the safe hands of his pretend internet spaceship guildmates.holy crap, this forum needs a :psyduck: emoticon so badly."
"rl death is natural, the modern person never sees a dead body so considers this macabre but i'd like everything i do to go somewhere so if the 5 stealth bombers and 20 isk note i've got left can give someone pleasure then so be it but...as a game mechanic.....noexploits are an issue, last time i went somewhere dodgy my account was inactive for months and too damn right i wanted my escapeism when i got home.if your eve mates are mates they would feel very odd taking your pimped manticore into battle.posted by an alt, this is an odd topic. if your ceo dies in rl i'm sure a discrete petition could let ccp put a director into the nececary position to keep the corp running."
"as has been made very apparent in fw the precision heavy missile needs work. currently most even vaugely nano'ed ships can outrun the explosion velocity with ease. other than training t2 guns (a large changes for players heavily invested in missile skills) caldari/missile using players have a few options in the wepon dept. while i think that missiles (or at least the launchers..) need some tweaks, the only one that it glaring messed up is the precision heavy. can we see about getting some help for that. (no this is not an anti-nano whine, i think the ships are fine for the most part its a missile users method of dealing with them that needs work."
"precision heavy thread in cms forum, with nice explanations and allgo there and vote, so you will get it on the first page. way more efficient than starting a new thread."
"simply put, this is an idea for a t2 ship that specializes in un-tackling its friends. maybe this is a role for a new ship, and maybe it's a role for an old ship that needs one (like afs).this ship could fit two new mods: a remote warp core stabilizer, and a remote anti-web (maybe name it 'remote momentum stabilizer', or something). those mods counter the effects of warp disruptors/scrams and statis webifiers on targetted ships.i think this would add a fun new role to play in group pvp.it can be balanced, as well. some examples of how to make it balanced:- remote wcs don't help with bubbles or with hic warp disruptors (bubble or focused).- make the ship slow, heavy, and un-nano-able. yes, even the minmatar one.- work the cap usage out so that an interceptor can hold a point and web longer than an anti-tackler can use its anti-tackle mods.keep in mind that since supercaps already cannot be affected by ewar, this ship cannot benefit them."
"ptsm"
"lets see, a t2 ship that specialises in breaking tackling?already exists. i give you the electronic attack frigate.simply put, if you can't lock it, you can't scram/web it, and that thing specialises in breaking target locking cababilities."
"i like this idea, although the ways it could affect fleet and gang warfare should be considered carefully. i bet there would be a lot of side-effects to introducing such a ship that would have to be minimized.this would be different from an electronic attack ship in that its role is a form of support rather than attack.actually, could these be merely new mods that the relatively underused logistics cruisers could use, rather than creating a new t2 ship class from scratch?"
"disagree,eas ships can already fill this role what is need to make it more viable is some way for a player to flag the ship that is tackling him to to other players so they know exactly who they needs to jam or damp. similar to the needs armor/shields button."
"that was a surprisingly funny article. i must say, i've never seen someone be described as \"almost erudite\" before. also, anything that references the infield fly rule is automatically a winner."

"uh oh ... rl goonswarm incoming."
"this is the inherent problem with things like the csm and other attempts at it in the past... it basically becomes about what they as individuals want and ultimately, they are there to represent themselves not the player base as a whole.where it will get ugly is if the devs pay any attention to them. in swg, the \"senate\" became a permanent dev ass kissing club which naturally got the devs listening to them instead of the players still howling at the cataclysmic game changes that came with the deletion of 2/3rds of the game in the nge. one example: most of their servers are not just low populated, they are empty. literally almost completely empty. the solution? merge servers? no, one of the \"senators\" convinced them to make improved player search tools so you could more efficiently search for players who are not there, all because that particular \"senator\" was a class a+ asskisser. so they wasted time developing something that was completely pointless and will do nothing to address the fact that they still have 25 servers when they have 1/10th the players they used to have.this is why i'm against things like the csm. the gaming professionals (ccp) should make the game and they should listen to players directly. not use a `leet club as a fluffer buffer."
"okay, i post once in a while. sometimes it has content, other times it is to flame the op. now, i am going to say this for all of eve and the csm/ccp to read.to all you whiners of nano***gotry, speed demons, hot drops, etc. shut the **** up. this is a game. it is not meant to be fair. i think i seen someone post about getting rid of learning skills? why? just cause your new and want to have it your way? in everyone of these posts, there are people whining cause they cannot do it or they cannot catch them or cannot cyno jam, blah blah blah. i am honestly quite sick of it. i can't fly a carrier. i had a nyx hotdropped onto a station fight in low sec (thank you omen, beautiful site) and i got wasted. ok, so i lost, next! i can use nano ships. i had a awesome arbitrator pilot (nano'd btw) who came, webbed, pwn'd and left. i win, i lose. such is the game. my goal in the game is to not have it fair. i don't want to be equal with everyone around me. i want unfair ganks, superior nano ships, etc. makes you work for your fun. some of us like 12km/s machariel's. some of us like slow moving hyperions' with 1200dps tanks. how the **** do you catch 12km/s or beat 1200dps tanks? use your ****ing head! this is a game where solo play and combined play come together. you choose your style. there are notices saying \"if you jump into this system, anyone can blow your ass away with concord saving you\". use what is around you and adapt. i personally can't deal with whiners. they simply complain about something they don't want to train for 6 months to have. well, i had to train for 6 ****ing months to t2 fit my rapier! i want to enjoy it, not have some snotnosed brat who started yesterday be able to compete with me!anyways, i'm off to do something other than ***** on the forums. thanks for reading.suvliana"
"i might not have put it that way, but i agree with the sentiment. wholeheartedly.best regards,windjammer"
"getting rid of learning skills might not be a bad idea. they are a total no brainer to train, it's not like other skills where you train however to customise your character. it's a \"fun tax\" when you're just starting out which isn't very good if you're trying to show newbies a good time."
"**** no."
"isn't it a bit unfair for those of use who like to use turrets, either becasue of their race or weopon preferances, have to wait so long to get t2 turrets.those that use missiles can just train for one class of missiles, for instance cruise, and not have to train anythingthing but that skill an the specialisation skill for that class.while those that use turrets have to train all the other turret skills, for instance large turrets, they have to train all the skills for them to lv5 and their specilisation skill for all the different sizes of turret before them to lv4 aswell to get the t2 they want.this makes it almost twice aslong to train for the t2 turrets than it would for someone to train for t2 nissiles.shouldnt it be made more even, so that it takes a equal amount of time for both.i think either make it so you dont have to train all those skills for the t2 turrets or make it so those who use missiles have to train more for their t2 missiles, instead of being prejidice agasint those that use turrets or those that dont choose caldari."
"yeah, but we only have to max 3 skills and not 6. it seems fair enough to me."
"the missile skill tree is longer than each gunnery one."
"and you get a superior weapon system anyway."
"harsh words, verone.i am a believer in the magic of time.so i can not make a final statement on the usefulness of the csm, yet.best case scenario would have been different from what we are seeing currently.but the task is not an easy one, either.maybe more practice will improve the csm.as i like to say, only time will tell."
"then your voting the wrong people i guess. it's not the csm that is bugging you. if you need more level headed players elect them? the csm is just as opinionated as the players in the game and thus that will cause conflict, and conflict is one of the things that makes eve, well... eve!so sure it's messy but when they all get together in person they all cool off because they are all good people. it's just don't think it's easy for everyone to put aside the in-game politics for the csm.that's why people should vote for me :p i live with a goonie, fight in factional warfare and 0.0 space. i've been playing for a long time. i have an alt in eve uni for teaching new players, i suicide gank people with my third alt, i love every part of eve and really don't have any issue with any players in the game. but i'm sure (point) that if i had no issues with the other csm members someone would whine about me not making conflicts and say i'm a ccp spy and i'm breaking the game and such."
"that was a surprisingly funny article. i must say, i've never seen someone be described as \"almost erudite\" before. also, anything that references the infield fly rule is automatically a winner."

"darius is from jersey!?new jersians unite!"
"uh oh ... rl goonswarm incoming."
"i wish they would fix the niggling little ui problem with the massive lag anytime you get more than 50 players in the same system. i would think even the empire people would be complaining now with the factional warfare stuff causing large gangs. \"then that ends up in some backlog, now we're using scrum and agile methodology, and that gets prioritized.\"consider setting your network code fix to a high priority and put it into your next sprint. see, i can use techno-jargon too. my guess: the guy who wrote it is the same guy who wrote the billboard code and after he left nobody can figure it out."
"i couldn't even log in to change a skill last night."
"seriously what the hell."
"yeah, why are you continuing to support this fail boat when you could run around outside naked."
"what is a fail boat?"
"i actually find that term funny."
